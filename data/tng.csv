S1E01-02,"Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 41153.7. Our destination is planet Deneb IV, beyond which lies the great unexplored mass of the galaxy. As you ordered, sir. My orders are to examine Farpoint, a starbase built by the inhabitants of that world. Meanwhile, I'm becoming better acquainted with my new command, this Galaxy-class USS Enterprise. I am still somewhat in awe of its size and complexity. As for my crew, we're short in several key positions, most notably a first officer. But I'm informed an experienced man, Cmdr William Riker, will be waiting to join the ship at our Deneb IV destination. You will agree, Data, that Starfleet's orders are difficult. Difficult? Simply solve the mystery of Farpoint Station. As simple as that. Farpoint Station. Even the name sounds mysterious. It's hardly simple to negotiate an agreement to use the base, and at the same time, snoop around, finding out why it was built. Inquiry. The word... ""snoop""? How can you be programmed as an encyclopedia of human information without knowing a simple word like ""snoop""? Possibility. A human behavior I was not designed to emulate. It means... To spy, to sneak. To seek covertly, to go stealthily, to slink, slither. Exactly. Glide, creep, pussyfoot, gumshoe. Captain. I'm sensing a... ...a powerful mind. Something strange on the detector circuit. It registers as solid. Or a powerful force field. If we collide with either... Shut off that damn noise! Go to yellow alert. Shields and deflectors up, sir. Reverse power, full stop. Controls to full stop, sir. Reading full stop, sir. Thou art notified that thy kind hath infiltrated the galaxy too far already. Thou art directed to return to thine own solar system. That's quite a directive. Would you mind identifying what you are? We call ourselves the Q. Or thou mayst call me that. It's all much the same thing. I present myself as a fellow ship captain, that thou mayst better understand me. Go back whence thou camest. Stay where thou art! Data, call medics. He's frozen! He would not have injured you. Recognize this? Stun setting? Knowing humans as thou dost, would thou be captured helpless by them? Now, go back or thou shalt most certainly die. Captain's log, supplementary. The frozen form of Lt Torres has been rushed to sickbay. The question now is the incredible power of the Q being. Do we dare oppose it? Captain, thy little centuries go by so rapidly. Perhaps thou will better understand this. Actually, the issue at stake is patriotism. Return home and end the commies. All it takes are a few good men. What? That nonsense is centuries behind us. You can't deny you're still a dangerous, savage, child race. Most certainly I deny it! I agree, we still were when humans wore costumes like that, 400 years ago. When you slaughtered millions in arguments about how to divide the resources of your little world. 400 years before that, you murdered each other over tribal god images. There are no indications humans will change. Even when we wore costumes like that we'd started to make rapid progress. Yeah? Want to review your rapid progress? Rapid progress, to where humans learn to control their military with drugs. Sir, sickbay reports Lt Torres's condition is better. Concern for one's fellow comrade. How touching. A personal request. Permission to clean up the bridge. Lt Worf is right. As Security Chief, I can't let... Yes, you can, Lt Yar. Better. And later, on finally reaching deep space, humans found enemies to fight out there, too. To broaden those struggles, you again found allies for more murdering. The same old story, all over again. No. The same old story is the one we're meeting now. Self-righteous life forms who are eager not to learn but to prosecute, to judge anything they can't understand or tolerate! An interesting idea. Prosecute and judge. I suppose it turns out we understand you humans only too well. We don't fear what the true facts about us will reveal. Facts about you? Splendid! You're a veritable fountain of good ideas. There are preparations to make. When we next meet, Captain, we'll proceed exactly as you suggest. Sir, respectfully submit our only choice is to fight. Fight or try to escape. Sense anything, Commander? Its mind is much too powerful. Recommend we avoid contact. From this point, no station aboard will make use of transmitted signals or intercom. We'll try and take them by surprise. Let's see what this starship can do. Inform engine room to prepare for maximum acceleration. Aye, sir. Record search, Data. Results of detaching saucer at high-warp velocity. Inadvisable at any warp speed, sir. Search theoretical. It is possible. But absolutely no margin for error. Using print-out, notify all decks to prepare for maximum acceleration. ""Maximum"" means pushing our engines well beyond safety limits. Our hope is to surprise whatever that is out there. Try and outrun it. Our only other option... ...is to tuck tail between our legs and return to Earth as they demand. Engine room ready, sir. The board shows green. All go. Stand by. Engage. Velocity warp 9.2. Heading 351, mark 11. Steady on that. The hostile is chasing. Accelerating fast. We're now at warp 9.3, which takes us past the red line. Continue accelerating. Counselor, at this point I'm open to guesses about what we just met. It felt like something beyond what we consider a life form. Beyond? Very, very advanced, sir, or certainly, very, very different. We're at 9.4, sir. Hostile is beginning to overtake. Are you sure? Hostile's velocity is warp 9.6. Shall I put them on the main viewer? Reverse angle. Magnifying viewer image. Hostile's velocity is 9.7, sir. Inform the engine room we need more. Attempting to comply, but... Yellow alert. Have photon torpedoes on ready status. Torpedoes to ready. Hostile now at warp 9.8, sir. Our velocity is only 9.5. Projection, sir. We may be able to match hostile's 9.8. But at extreme risk. Now reading the hostile at warp 9.9! Now, hear this. Print-out message, urgent. All stations on all decks, prepare for emergency saucer sever. Command the saucer section, Lieutenant. I am a Klingon. To seek escape when my captain goes into battle... You are a Starfleet officer, Lieutenant. Aye, sir. Make the mark, Data. Note in ship's log, that at this startime I'm transferring command to the battle bridge. Captain's log, stardate 41153.7. Preparing to detach saucer section, so families and most of the ship's company can seek relative safety, while the stardrive, with the battle bridge and armaments, will turn back and confront the mystery that is threatening us. Torpedoes must detonate close enough to the hostile to blind it when we separate. Understood, sir. All decks acknowledging. Worf, this is the Captain. At separation, we will reverse power just enough to get your saucer out and clear. Understood. Torpedoes away, sir. Begin countdown. Mark. Starship separation in six, five, four, three, two, one. Separation is successful, sir. Torpedoes have detonated, sir. Let's come to a stop. Reverse power. Reverse power. Decelerating. Dead stop. We'll hold this position... and wait for them. That will bring them here in just minutes. Will we make a fight of it? Lieutenant. You recommend that we fight a life form that can do all that? I'd like to hear your advice. I spoke before I thought. We should distract them from going after the saucer. All forward motion stopped, sir. Thank you, conn. Commander, signal the following in all languages and on all frequencies. We surrender. State that we are not asking for any terms or conditions. Aye, sir. All language forms and frequencies. The prisoners will all stand. Historically intriguing, Captain. Very accurate. Mid-21st century. The post-atomic horror. All present, stand and make respectful attention to honored judge. Careful, sir. This is not an illusion or a dream. But these courts belong in the past. I don't understand, either. But this is real. Get to your feet, criminals! At least we're acquainted with the judge. Attention! On your feet. Attention! You are out of order. The prisoners will not be harmed... ...until they're found guilty. Dispose of that. Can we assume this will be a fair trial? Yes, absolutely equitable. Before this gracious court now appear these prisoners to answer for the multiple and grievous savageries of the species. How plead you, criminal? If I may, Captain? Objection. In the year 2036, the New United Nations declared no Earth citizen could be made to answer for the crimes of his race or forbears. Objection denied. This is a court of the year 2079, by which time more rapid progress had caused all United Earth nonsense to be abolished. Tasha, no! I must! I grew up in a world that allowed things like this court. It was people like these that saved me from it. This so-called court should get down on its knees to what Starfleet is. What it represents. You barbarian! This woman... Criminals, keep silent! You have a lot to learn if you think you can torture us into silence! Will she live? Uncertain. When he froze Torres, sickbay helped thaw him out. You will answer the charges, criminal. For what? For this? Her death? Or worse? You promised the prisoners will not be harmed. We plead nothing if you break your own rules. I suggest you centre your attention on this trial. It may be your only hope. You're having second thoughts. If you conduct a fair trial, which was your promise, you may lose. Lose? Yes. Even as judge and prosecutor. And jury. Accepted, so long as you keep to your agreement. Assaulting a prisoner isn't a fair trial! This is a merciful court. Silence! To continue, I must caution you that legal trickery is not permitted. This is a court of... A court of fact. We humans know our past, even when we're ashamed of it. I recognize this court system as the one that agreed with the line from Shakespeare, ""Kill all the lawyers."" Which was done. Leading to the rule ""guilty until proven innocent."" Bringing the innocent to trial would be unfair. You will answer to the charge of being a grievously savage race. ""Grievously savage"" could mean anything. I will answer only specific charges. Are you certain you want a full disclosure of human ugliness? So be it, fool. Present the charges. Criminal, you will read the charges to the court. I see no charges against us, Your Honor. You are out of order! Soldiers, you will press those triggers if this criminal answers with any word other than guilty. Criminal, how plead you? Guilty. Provisionally. The court will hear the provision. We question whether you are abiding by your own instructions. May Cmdr Data repeat the record? No legal trickery. These will be your own words. What followed the statement that prisoners will not be harmed? Yes, sir. The Captain asked the question... Can we assume this will be a fair trial? And in reply the judge stated... Yes, absolutely equitable. Irrelevant testimony, entirely irrelevant. Alright! We agree, there is evidence to support the contention that humans have been savage. So, I say test us. Test whether this is presently true of humans. I see. You petition the court to accept you and your comrades as proof of what humanity has become? There must be many ways to test us. We have a long mission ahead. Another brilliant suggestion. But your test hardly requires a long mission. Your immediate destination offers more challenge than you can possibly imagine. Yes, this Farpoint Station will be an excellent test. All present, respectfully stand. This court is adjourned, to allow the criminals to be tested. This honorable court is adjourned. Stand respectfully. Captain, you may find that you're not nearly clever enough to deal with what lies ahead for you. It may have been better to accept sentence here. What is present course, conn? What it's been all along, sir. Direct heading to Farpoint Station. Confirm. We are on that heading, sir. Know anything about Farpoint, sir? Sounds a fairly dull place. We've heard that we may find it rather interesting. Personal log, Cmdr William Riker. Stardate 41153.7. The USS Hood has dropped me off at Farpoint Station. I await the arrival of the new USS Enterprise, to which I've been assigned as First Officer. Meanwhile, I've been asked to the Administrator's Office, in the old city. Cmdr Riker, we've still no word from your vessel. I trust we made your waiting comfortable? Luxurious is more like it. Good. Is it ungrateful to ask for information? Anything. Fascinating, the advanced materials used to construct this station. Your energy surplus must be abundant. Geothermal energy is a great blessing of this planet. I'll send details to your quarters. Thank you. But it still seems incredible to me that you constructed this station so rapidly and so... ...so perfectly suited to our needs. Would you care for an Earth delicacy, Commander? If there's an apple... I'm sorry, Commander. It doesn't matter. I was saying... I'll be damned. Yes. There was another selection here. Groppler, I could swear this wasn't here a minute ago. Did your failure to notice it make it unwelcome? Not at all. I trust it will be the same with Farpoint Station. A few easily answered questions about it won't make Starfleet appreciate it less. And it's delicious. Thank you. Good morning, Groppler Zorn. You have been told not to do that. Why can't you understand? It will arouse their suspicion. And if that happens, we will have to punish you. We will, I promise you! Dr Crusher! Mother. It's Cmdr Riker. Hello, Wes. Enjoying Farpoint? Yes, sir. Can I join you for a stroll? We were about to go shopping. I've wanted to visit the mall. Of course. If you're wondering about Mom, she's not unfriendly. She's just shy with men she doesn't know. Wesley! That means he'd like us to be friends. I'm willing. Although we're not officially part of the Enterprise, we can do something useful while we wait. Useful? How? Investigating some things I've noticed here. Gold would be lovely with this. I am sure there are reasons for a first officer to demonstrate energy and alertness to a new captain. But my duty and interests are outside the command structure... It's remarkable they had exactly what you asked for. Thank you. I'll take the entire bolt. Send it to our starship when it arrives. Charge to Dr Crusher. Let's see, where were we? I accused you of currying favor with our Captain. I apologize. Mom, that gold pattern wasn't there. Maybe Jean-Luc would like this looked into. Jean-Luc Picard? You know the Captain? When I was little, he brought my father's body home to us. Yes, Wes, long ago. A pleasure to meet you, Commander. Excuse us. My pleasure, Doctor. Wes. Sir? See you on board. Yes, sir. Sir, the Enterprise is arriving... Is this an official report? Sorry. Lt La Forge reporting. The Enterprise arriving, but without the saucer, sir. What happened? I don't know. Capt Picard wants you to beam up. Our new Captain doesn't waste time. It's a good idea. Thank you, Lieutenant. Aye, sir. Enterprise, this is Cmdr Riker at Farpoint Station. Standing by to beam up. Lt Yar of Security, sir. Capt Picard will see you on the battle bridge. With no saucer, I assume something interesting happened. Battle bridge. That's for the Captain to explain, sir. Do we have clearance? Aye, sir, standard parking orbit. Make it so. Cmdr Riker, sir. Riker, WT, reporting as ordered, sir. Is the viewer ready? All set up, sir. We'll bring you up to date on our little adventure. Then we'll talk. Welcome aboard. This way, sir. Thou art directed to return to thine own solar system. Go back, or thou shalt most certainly die. You can't deny you're still a dangerous, savage, child race. Message from the saucer module, sir. It will arrive here in 51 minutes. Inform them we'll connect when they arrive. Send the Commander to me when he's finished. 400 years before that, you murdered each other over tribal god images. There are no indications that humans will change. There are preparations to make. When we next meet, Captain, we'll proceed exactly as you suggest. He calls that a little adventure? Come. Not exactly a run-of-the-mill happening. It seems we're alive only because we have been placed on probation. A very serious kind of probation. Go. The saucer module now entering orbit with us, sir. Acknowledge. Cmdr Riker will conduct a manual docking. Picard out. Sir? You reported in. You are qualified? Yes, sir. Then I mean now, Commander. They say you will be doing this manually, sir. No automation. As ordered. Velocity to one half-meter per second. Adjust pitch angle. Negative, three degrees. Watch your roll angle, conn. All stations, prepare for reconnection. Thrusters to station keeping. All velocity zero. Her inertia should do the job. Lock up. Now. A routine maneuver but you handled it quite well. Thank you, sir. I hope I showed some promise. I have some questions for you. I thought you might. I see in your file that Capt DeSoto thinks very highly of you. One curious thing, you refused to let him beam down to Altair III. In my opinion, it was too dangerous to risk exposing the Captain. I see. A captain's rank means nothing to you. Rather the reverse. But a captain's life means a great deal more to me. Isn't it just possible that you don't get to be a Starfleet captain without knowing whether it's safe to beam down or not? Isn't it presumptuous of a first officer to second-guess his captain's judgment? Permission to speak candidly, sir? Always. Having been a first officer yourself, you know that assuming that responsibility must include the safety of the captain. I have no problem following your rules, short of compromising your safety. You won't back off from that position? No, sir. One further thing. A special favor. Anything, sir. Using the same strength you showed with DeSoto, can you keep me from making an ass of myself with children? Sir? I'm not a family man. And yet Starfleet has given me a ship with children aboard. Yes, sir. And I... I don't feel comfortable with children. But since a captain needs an image of geniality... ...you're to see that's what I project. Aye, sir. Welcome to the Enterprise, Cmdr Riker. I've heard of your case. The visor you wear... Is a remarkable piece of bio-electronic engineering by which I see much of the EM spectrum ranging from heat and infrared through radio waves, et cetera, and forgive me if I've said and listened to this a thousand times. You've been blind all your life? I was born this way. You always had pain from using this? They say it's because I use my natural sensors in different ways. I see two choices. The first is painkillers. Which affect how this works. No. And choice number two? Exploratory surgery. Desensitize the brain areas troubling you. Same difference. No, thank you, Doctor. I understand. See you. Yes, sir? Where will I find Cmdr Data? Cmdr Data is on special assignment, using our shuttle to transfer an admiral to the Hood. An admiral? He's been checking medical layout. Why a shuttle? Why not beam over? I suppose he could, but the Admiral's a rather... remarkable man. Have you got some reason you want my atoms scattered all over space, boy? No, sir. But at your age, why put up with the trouble of a shuttle craft? Hold it right there, boy. Sir? What about my age? If that subject troubles you... Troubles me? What's so damn troublesome about not having died? How old do you think I am anyway? 137 years, Admiral, according to Starfleet records. Explain how you remember that so exactly. I remember every fact I'm exposed to, sir. I don't see no points on your ears, boy, but you sound like a Vulcan. No, sir. I'm an android. Almost as bad. I thought it was accepted that Vulcans are an advanced and most honorable race. They are. And damn annoying at times. Yes, sir. Well, this is a new ship, but she's got the right name. You remember that, you hear? I will, sir. You treat her like a lady. And she'll always bring you home. Did you signal the Hood? Your exact message. Bon voyage, mon ami. What was the reply, computer? You're wasting time, Captain. Or did you think I was gone? Lieutenant! Do you intend to blast a hole in the viewer? If the purpose of this is to test humans, Your Honor, we must proceed in our own way. You are dilatory. You have 24 hours. Any further delay and you risk summary judgment against you. Sorry, sir. You reacted fast, Mr. Worf. But futilely. I will learn to do better, sir. Of course you will. We've a long voyage ahead of us. What do we do, if they're monitoring our every move and word? We do exactly what we would if this Q never existed. If we're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are. Personal log, stardate 41153.8. Of the 24 hours Q allotted us to prove ourselves, 11 have now passed without incident. And yet I cannot forget Q's prediction that we will face some critical test. This planet's interior heat provides an abundance of geothermal energy. And this is what made it possible for them to construct this base to Starfleet standards? Yes. They must have been trading surplus energy for the construction materials used here. Many of the materials are not found on this world. It's like those incidents you describe in your report as ""almost magical attempts to please us."" Those events did happen, sir. None of it suggests anything threatening. If only every life form had as much desire to please. Ready to beam down? I look forward to meeting this Groppler Zorn. I have a feeling there's more to it than trying to please us. As if it's something Q is doing to trick us? Over here. I've asked the Counselor to join us in this meeting. May I introduce our new First Officer, Cmdr William Riker. Riker, ship's Counselor Deanna Troi. Do you remember what I taught you, Imzadi? Can you still sense my thoughts? A pleasure, Commander. Likewise, Counselor. Have the two of you met before? We have, sir. Excellent. I consider it important for my key officers to know each other's abilities. We do, sir. We do. I, too, could never say goodbye, Imzadi. We need more information before we can make recommendations to Starfleet. No objections to that. But I'm puzzled over you bringing a Betazoid to this meeting. If her purpose, sir, is to probe my thoughts... I can sense only strong emotions, Groppler. I'm only half Betazoid. My father was a Starfleet officer. Well, I have nothing to hide, of course. Good, since we admire what we've seen of your construction techniques. Starfleet may be interested in your constructing starbases elsewhere. We are not interested in building other facilities. If I may, Captain. Then, a trade. Some things that you need in return for lending us engineers who can demonstrate your techniques. Bandi do not enjoy leaving their homeworld. If Starfleet cannot accept that small weakness, then we will be forced, unhappily, to seek an alliance with someone like the Ferengi. Counselor? What is it? Do you want it described here? Yes. No secrets here if we're to be all friends. Agreed? We ourselves have nothing to hide. Pain. Loneliness. Terrible loneliness. Despair. I'm not sensing Groppler, or any of his people, but it's something very close to us here. The source of this, Groppler. Have you any idea? No. No, absolutely not. And I find nothing helpful or productive in any of this! And that's it? No other comment? What do you expect of us? We offer you a base designed to your needs. Luxurious by even human standards. While evading our simplest questions about it. We'll adjourn for now... ...while we all reconsider our positions. The Ferengi would be very interested in a base like this. Fine. Let's hope they find you as tasty as their past associates. Ensign, could you help me find Cmdr Data? He's somewhere on this deck. This way. You must be new to these Galaxy-class starships. Tell me the location of Cmdr Data. Lt Cmdr Data, now located in holodeck area 4J. And as you can see, it's pointing you that way. Thank you. You're welcome. The next hatchway on your right. Thank you. You're welcome, Cmdr Riker. And if you care to enter? I do. Hello? Marvelous! How easily humans do that. I still need much practice. There's some puzzles down on the... ...down on the planet, that the Captain wants answered. He suggests that I take you with me. I shall endeavor to function adequately. Yes. When the Captain suggested you, I looked up your record. A wise procedure, sir. Your rank of Lieutenant Commander is honorary? No, Starfleet class of '78, honors in probability and mechanics. Your file says you're a... Machine. Correct. Does that trouble you? To be honest, yes, a little. Understood, sir. Prejudice is very human. That does trouble me. Do you consider yourself superior to us? I am superior in many ways, but I would gladly give it up to be human. Nice to meet you... Pinocchio. A joke. Intriguing. You'll be an interesting companion. This woodland pattern is quite popular because it duplicates Earth so well. Coming here almost makes me feel human. These simulations seem so real. Much of it is. If the transporters can convert our bodies to an energy beam and then back... Yes. Rocks and vegetation have simpler patterns. Correct, sir. The rear wall. I can't see it. We're right next to it. Incredible! Cmdr Riker, isn't this great? This is one of the simple patterns. They've got thousands more. Some you can't believe. Careful, the next rock is loose! Wesley! Wow! Mr. Data has agreed to join me on the away team. Very good. Maybe I should get something to wipe this water up. Good idea. There's a low-gravity gymnasium, too. It'd be hard to get bored on this ship. Good. Mom, could you get me a look at the bridge? That's against Captain's orders. Are you afraid of him, too? I certainly am not. But Capt Picard is a pain, isn't he? Your father liked him very much. Great explorers are often lonely. No chance to have a family. Just a look at the bridge. I'll stay in the lift when the doors open. You are asking for trouble, Wes. We'll see what we can do. Someone could begin by examining the underside of the station. Our sensors do show some passages. Perhaps you and I? Tasha, you and the Counselor. And, Geordi, I want your eyes down there. You and I will start topside. Noticed anything unusual? I can't see as well as Geordi, but the material seems ordinary. Construction records? Almost identical to Starfleet's. Team leader? We've found something interesting. We're in a passageway directly under the station. These walls are something I've never seen before. How are you examining them? In every way. Microscopically, thermally, electromagnetically. None of it is familiar. What about you, Troi? I've avoided opening my mind. Whatever I felt in Groppler's office became very uncomfortable. I'm sorry, you must. We need more information. Pain. Such pain! I'm coming. Enterprise, lock us on to her signal. I'm sorry. Close your mind to the pain. Unhappiness. Terrible despair. Who? I don't know. No life form anything like us. What in the hell kind of place is this? Geordi, what do you see? Well, it's of... It's of no material I recognize or have even heard of. What the hell?! Children are not allowed on the bridge. Permission to report to the Captain. Dr Crusher. Captain. Sir, my son is not on the bridge, he accompanied me on the turbolift. Your son? His name's Wesley. You last saw him years ago when... Well... ...as long as he's here... I... I knew... I knew your father. Want to look around? But don't touch anything! Try it out. The panel on your right is for log entries, Library computer access retrieval, screen control and intercom. Here... The backup ops panels, plus shield and armory controls. The forward viewscreen is controlled from the ops position. High-resolution, multi-spectro sensors. How do you know that? Perimeter alert! I'm sorry. Get off the bridge! Both of you! You have a perimeter alert. As my son tried to tell you. Picard. Go ahead. Sensors have detected a vessel approaching this planet. No ship is scheduled at this time. Have Riker and his team beam back up. Security, is it the Hood returning? It does not match the Hood's configuration. Put it on main viewer. Identification? Vessel unknown, configuration unknown. Hail it. We've been trying. No response. Raise shields, phasers at ready. Shields up, sir, phasers ready. Get me Groppler Zorn. Continue greetings on all frequencies. This is Zorn, Captain. An unidentified vessel has entered orbit with us. Do you know who it is? No ships are scheduled to arrive until... I asked you if you knew who it is. You mentioned the Ferengi Alliance. But we've had no dealings with them. It was only a... a thought. Are you certain? I promise you. We were making an empty threat. I wanted your cooperation. Forgive me. Entering orbital trajectory. It measures 12 times our volume. Sensors say we were just scanned. Pain again? You've been at it enough. No. I feel close to an answer of some kind. Something down here is shielding our communicators. Yes, that's the feeling I've been reading, as if someone doesn't want us to be in touch with our ship. Let's get to the surface. There is no computer record of any such vessel, sir. Nothing even close. No response. We've done everything but threaten them. Sensor scans, Mr. Worf. Our sensor signals just seem to bounce off. Something's happening, sir. They're firing on Farpoint. Photon torpedoes to ready. They're hitting the Bandi city, not Farpoint Station. Those stairs are where we entered. Here it becomes ordinary stone. God! Was that a phaser blast? Negative. But something similar. You, Tasha, Geordi, beam up to the ship. I wanna see what's happening. Don't! lf you should be hurt... You have your orders, Lieutenant. Carry them out. Yes, I'm sorry, sir. Enterprise, three to beam up. Enterprise! Enterprise, come in! Help us! Please! What shall we do? Enterprise, help us! Please! Tune that down. Cmdr Riker, come in. Can you hear me? Riker to Enterprise, come in. Cmdr Riker, come in. Where are you? With Data, on the edge of the old city. It's being hit hard, sir. Farpoint Station? Any damage there? Negative on damage to Farpoint. They're avoiding hitting the station. It's from an unidentified vessel that's entered orbit. No ID, no answer to our signals. The old Bandi city's being hit hard. Many casualties very probable. Understand, Commander. Would you object to your Captain ordering an illegal kidnapping? No objection, sir. Groppler Zorn may have the answers we need. Bring him here. Aye, sir. They're forcing a difficult decision on me. Protecting the Bandi won't violate the Prime Directive. True, they are not allies, but... We are in the midst of diplomatic discussions with them. Lieutenant, lock phasers on that vessel. Phasers locked on. Typical. So typical. Savage life forms never follow even their own rules. Get off my bridge! Interesting, that order about phasers. Standing by on phasers. Don't let me interfere. Use your weapons. We've no idea who is on that vessel. My order was a safety precaution. Really? No idea what it represents? The meaning of that vessel is as plain as the noses on your ugly little primate faces. And if you were truly civilized, wouldn't you be doing something about the casualties down there? Captain to CMO, are you reading any of this? Medical team preparing to beam down. Compliments on that, Doctor. Any questions? Starfleet people are trained to render aid... But not trained in clear thinking. Let's consider your thoughts. You call us savages. Yet you knew those people would be killed. It is your conduct that is uncivilized. They're firing on the planet again. Go to maneuvering jets. Position us between that vessel and the planet. Force fields full on. Aye, sir. Impulse power to... We have no ship control, sir. It's gone! Are you undamaged? Yes. You? All systems operating. Please! Make it stop! You can drive it away! Drive who away? I don't know. Unlikely. Our records show you supervised all Bandi contact with other worlds. We've done nothing wrong! If we can learn nothing from you, we'll leave. No! Oh no, please, don't leave! I'll... try to explain. First Officer to Enterprise. We've lost Zorn. Something like a transporter beam has snatched him away. Question, sir. Could it be this Q? None of you knows who transported him. You're running out of time. Captain... suddenly I'm sensing something else. Satisfaction. Enormous satisfaction. From the same source as before? No. That was on the planet. This is much closer. Excellent, Counselor. He's such a dullard, isn't he? Captain from transporter room. Riker and Data have beamed aboard. Excellent. With more little minds helping... That is enough! We have an agreement. Which you are breaking by taking over our vessel, interfering with my decisions. Either leave or finish us! Temper, temper, mon capitaine. I'm merely trying to assist a pitiful species. I will leave if Riker provides me with some amusement. Do nothing that he asks. But I ask so little and it's so necessary if you're to solve this. Beam over there with your... what is it? Your away team. I'll risk no one on that unknown. You should know what you'll find. Perhaps it's too adult a puzzle. With all respect, Captain, I want to beam over there. You show promise, my good fellow. Have you understood any part of what he's tried to tell you? Humanity is no longer a savage race. But you must still prove that. You impressed him, Number One. That's hopeful. Thank you. If he's not open to evidence in our favor, where will you go from there? I'll attend to my duty. To the bitter end? I see nothing so bitter about that. Can I help you? I... I didn't want you thinking me harsh. Cold-blooded. Why would I ever think that? I didn't welcome you aboard personally, professionally. I made you come to me on the bridge, I yelled at your son. Who, as you pointed out, was quite correct. He seems to have a very good grasp of starship operations. You've just won this mother's heart. But, now, your assignment here. I would... consider... and approve a transfer for you. You consider me unqualified? Hardly. Your service record shows you're just the CMO I want. Then you object to me personally? I'm thinking of your feelings. For you to work with a commanding officer who would continually remind you of a... terrible personal tragedy. If I had had any objections, I wouldn't have requested this assignment. You requested this posting? My feelings about my husband's death won't affect the way I serve you or this mission. Then, welcome aboard, Doctor. Riker to Picard. We're ready to beam over. I... hope we can be friends? Thank you. Phasers on stun. Energize. Most interesting, sir. It's the same construction we saw in the underground tunnel. But no sound of power. No equipment. How does this ship run? What is it? Is it the same as you felt down there? No. This is much more powerful. Full of anger! Hate! Toward us? No. It's directed down towards the old Bandi city. Most intriguing again. The place this vessel was firing upon was not the Farpoint starbase, but the home of those who constructed... Sorry, sir. I seem to be commenting on everything. Good. Don't stop, my friend. Enterprise, Riker. This is turning out to be a very long tunnel or corridor. No ship's crew in sight. No sign of mechanism or circuitry. No controls or read-outs. This is nothing like any vessel I've seen before. Groppler Zorn, sir. A great fear just ahead. There's a different feeling here than in the tunnel. Very different. No! Please! No more, please! Make it stop! Please! Please! Make it stop! No! Please! No more! Please! Zorn, can you hear me? The pain! No! Has the alien communicated? Please! Please! No more! That's it, sir. It's just one alien I'm sensing here. Please! I don't understand what you want! Not true, he does know. No! Don't! Transporter Chief, yank them back now! Riker, acknowledge! Your time is up, Captain. Transporter Chief, do you have their coordinates? He can't hear you. Transporter Chief, come in! I have people... in trouble over there, Q. Everyone at ease. That's an order. Q, my people are in trouble. Let me help them, please. I'll do whatever you say. You'll do whatever I say? It seems I did make that bargain. The agreement isn't valid. It wasn't Q that saved us. Save yourself. It may attack you now. It was that which sent us back. It is not merely a vessel. Somehow it is alive. She lies. Destroy it. Make phasers and photon torpedoes ready. No, do nothing he demands. That thing was killing my people! Was there a reason? It's an unknown. Isn't that enough? If you'd earned that uniform, you'd know it's the unknown that brings us here. A wasted effort, with human intelligence. Let's test that. Begin with the tunnels under Farpoint. Identical to those on the space vessel life form over there. Why was it punishing you? In return for some pain you'd given another creature? We've done nothing wrong. It was injured. We helped it. Thank you. That was the missing element. Lt Yar, rig main phaser banks to deliver an energy beam. Aye, sir. You're right, Captain. It has to be conceivable that in this galaxy there could exist creatures able to convert energy into matter. And into specific patterns of matter, as our transporters do. Captain! You... captured something like that, didn't you? Warn my people to leave Farpoint Station immediately. He lies. Shouldn't you let his people die? Transmit the message, ""Leave Farpoint Station."" It was a pair of creatures I was sensing. One down there in grief and pain... ...the other up here filled with anger. And firing not on the space station, but on the Bandi and their city. Attacking those who had captured... ...captured its mate. Energy beam ready. Lock it in on Farpoint Station. I see now it was too simple a puzzle. Generosity has always been my... weakness. Let it have whatever it can absorb. Energize. Now getting feedback on the beam. Discontinue. There'll soon be no Farpoint Station, if I'm right about this. A lucky guess. We meant no harm to the creature. It was starving for energy. Which your world furnishes. We did feed it. Only enough to keep it alive, so you could force it to shape itself into whatever form you needed! Sir! Wonderful! A feeling of great joy. And gratitude. From both of them. Why... ...do you use other life forms for your recreation? If so, you've not provided the best. Leave us! We've passed your little test. Temper, temper, mon capitaine. Get off my ship! I do so only because it suits me. But I will not promise never to appear again. Captain's log, stardate 41174.2. The agreement for rebuilding Farpoint Station has been completed per my instructions. All stations? Ready for departure, sir. Some problem? Just hoping this isn't the usual way our missions will go. Oh no, Number One, I'm sure most will be much more interesting. Let's see what's out there. Engage. "
S1E03,"Captain's log, stardate 41209.2. We are going to rendezvous with a science vessel, SS Tsiolkovsky, which has been monitoring the collapse of a red supergiant star into a white dwarf. What has brought us here is a series of strange messages indicating something has gone wrong aboard the research vessel. SS Tsiolkovsky, repeat your message. Hello, Enterprise. Welcome. I hope you have a lot of pretty boys there, because I'm willing and waiting. In fact, we're going to have a real blow-out here. Do it, yeah! Go ahead! Do it! Captain, what we've just heard is... impossible. Report. I believe that last sound was an emergency hatch being blown. Are you certain? Yes, of course you are. Data, Geordi, Tasha. Searcher scans now reveal no life signs aboard, Captain. Cover the ship as planned. Move out. Indications of what humans would call... a wild party? Yeah. Their bridge. If this works, be sure to record everything. You were right. Somebody blew out the hatch. They were all sucked out into space. Correction, sir, that's blown out. Thank you, Data. A common mistake, sir. Cmdr Riker, Lt Yar. Location, Engineering. Ten people here, sir, all frozen. No vital signs. Frozen? How? It looks like someone was playing with the environmental controls. Just let all the heat bleed away into space. Sir, Lt La Forge in the crew quarters. Something in here. Riker to Captain. I have a report, sir. Picard here. They're all dead. Some of them were blown out of the emergency hatches. But there were 80 people on that ship. Yes, sir. As I said... all dead. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, supplemental. We are downloading information gathered on the collapsing star nearby. I'm concerned at being in such close orbit. But the Tsiolkovsky's research records should predict the time of the star's final collapse. I can't find anything unusual in the readings they sent over. Give me a theory, Doctor. Anything. Madness? Mass hysteria? Delusion? Any or all, Captain. Alright, let's bring the away team back. Set the transporter to maximum decontamination, and then full examination and observation when they're here. If you were any more perfect, I'd put you in a medical textbook. I'm already listed in several bio-mechanical texts. Yes, of course. You're next, Lieutenant. Normal, all across. Except, why are you perspiring, Lieutenant? Because you have it too hot in here! What else would it be? It doesn't sound like you, Geordi. Well, maybe it's not. Maybe she threw her voice. Hey, it was a joke. Of course, but I would like to run a few more tests on you, Lieutenant. Sickbay to bridge. Picard here. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm confining Lt La Forge to sickbay until further notice. Do we have a problem, Doctor? I don't know yet. I need help in locating some library computer information. Specifics, sir? I have a vague memory of reading somewhere about someone taking a shower in their clothing. Ah, the body Geordi discovered. I believe it's happened before. To someone, somewhere. This should be easy for someone written up in bio-mechanical texts. About that, sir, did the Doctor believe I was boasting? Probably. This may take some time. Several hours. What I said was a statement of fact. Perhaps she will look it up. You can depend on it. Geordi! Security, Lt La Forge left sickbay while I was in my office. He doesn't have his communicator. We must find him. Security team, pick up Lt La Forge. He just left sickbay. Captain, anything further? Affirmative. Make it a ship-wide search, Lieutenant. It's a model of the ship's tractor beam, with my ideas added. That's your science project? Wes, you're really something. Since the Captain won't let me on the bridge, I use this to imagine I'm there. Take the helm, Mr. Crusher. Set a course for 37, mark 180. Warp six. It's the Captain's voice. It's words he used on the intercom. I can pretend he's ordering me to take the Enterprise anywhere. Listen to this. Chief Engineer, report to the bridge. Cmdr Riker, report to the bridge. Dr Crusher, report to the bridge. What d'you think? I think the Captain's lucky you're on his side. But he still won't let me on the bridge. There's nothing there I don't understand. I wish... I understood myself that well. Are you OK? No, suddenly I... I seem to be burning up inside. It's so hot in here. Geordi? Geordi. Lt Yar in the observation lounge. Send a team now. Medical's worried about you. Help me. Help me to not give in to the wild things in my mind. My job is security... Tasha, please. Alright. Helping is more important. Geordi, how can I help you? Help me to see. Like you do. But you already see better than I can. I see more. But more isn't better. Geordi, please! I wanna see in shallow, dim, beautiful, human ways. We'll talk about it, Geordi. Now, I'm gonna take you to sickbay. Alright? Yeah. OK. Good. We got him to sickbay so Dr Crusher could examine him. He wasn't violent? No, sir. He was very upset. He kept talking about wanting normal vision. Thank you, Lieutenant. Our read-outs still show nothing wrong with him. He looks to have a temperature, but our instruments say not. Doctor, every person on that ship died. Is there any chance that whatever did it is loose on my ship? If you mean a disease, I'd say no chance. We used full decontamination. We examined every team member. The entire crew somehow managed to kill themselves, Doctor. If not a disease, what else made them do it? Alternatives are in the areas of insanity and severe emotional upset. Troi, do you feel anything unusual in the Lieutenant? Security told me that he was longing for normal sight. That's a sudden yearning. His records show no previous mention of that. The fact that it happened now could be important. But all I sense from him is confusion. If I didn't know better, I'd say he was intoxicated. Our tests would've shown that, or any signs of drugs, hallucinogens or contaminants. Can you provide more information, sir? Seeking an instance of someone showering in clothing is... It's like looking for a needle in a haystack. Why should anyone expend time in such a search? I should've said proverbial needle in a haystack. Ah! A human proverb. As in folklore. Or an historical allusion. Historical. That's it. I was reading about all the past starships named Enterprise. Enterprise history. Aberrant behavior. Medical cross-reference. Captain, I think we have the answer to what happened. ""The Starship Enterprise. Capt James T. Kirk commanding."" Similar conditions. They were monitoring a planet that was breaking up. Not a collapsing star, as in this case. But there were the same huge shifts in gravity. Which resulted in complex strings of water molecules which acquired carbon from the body and acted... ...acted on the brain like alcohol. Data, download this information to Medical. Downloading. Fascinating. The entire crew going out of control. Like intoxication, but worse. Judgment almost completely impaired. Until they found this formula, barely in time. Picard to Dr Crusher. Come in. This is Crusher. Go ahead. You can relax. The answer is feeding into your medical banks right now. Including a cure. Are you certain, Captain? Absolutely. Tasha? What are you doing? I need your advice. That's why I came to your quarters. Of course, anything... On clothes. You always wear such beautiful clothes off duty. And your hair always looks so nice. I wanna change my image. What do you think about this? Or... or this one? It's not for you. Tasha, I feel you're very uncertain. That you're fighting something. What is it? Never mind. I'll find what I need myself. Ship's stores will have it. Tasha? Wait! Troi to Capt Picard. Picard, here. Sir, I think Tasha's been infected, too. She just left my quarters. It's not actually an infection. Yes, sir. It's more like an intoxication. But, whatever it is... she's got it. Thank you, Counselor. Number One, it seems our Security Chief has the equivalent of a snootful. Inquiry, sir. Snootful? Forget it. Hey, Mom, look what I can do. I've widened and strengthened the beam, like I said last night. Do me a favor. Something's happening on this ship. Just to be safe, stay in our quarters until it's solved. Sure, Mom. Your wish is my command. Now, Wes! OK. But you could be stunting my emotional growth, you realize that? Why is it so hot in here? Picard to Crusher. Crusher here. Have you made a test injection yet? We have indications that this condition is spreading. No test yet, Captain. But very soon. In 41 minutes, the information from the Tsiolkovsky will be downloaded. Why so slow? Slow, sir? The Tsiolkovsky has been eight months in accumulating it. How much danger from that star? Worst case. Like a full collapse, sir? Any material it threw this way, we could outrun on half impulse power. Picard to Engineering. Chief Engineer, report to the bridge. Assistant Chief Engineer Shimoda, report to Medical. Hi, Jim. Was that the Captain ordering you to Medical? Which would leave no one on duty. The chief was summoned to the bridge. What about me? I could call the chief on the bridge if anything happened. Reporting as ordered, sir. What? You ordered me to report to the bridge, sir. I did no such thing. I want you in the engine room in case we need to move out. Attention, all divisions. Effective immediately, I have handed over control to Acting Captain Wesley Crusher. Acting Captain? Thank you, Capt Picard. And so dawns a brave new day for the Enterprise. Captain's log, stardate 41209.3. The contaminant that led to the deaths of the Tsiolkovsky crew is now aboard the Enterprise. Our Engineering section has been commandeered by young Wesley Crusher. And henceforth, a dessert course shall precede and follow every meal, including breakfast. Hurray for the Acting Captain. Never got as far as sickbay, Wes. I feel too good for that. Incredible. How did you do that? Hooked my model tractor beam into the ship's power. Now, it's a repulser beam, too. Want in? Swear to be faithful to you, Captain. Number One, MacDougal, get that boy out of Engineering. Sir, I'm getting very strange reports from all decks. Such as? Such as the Training Division giving a lecture on metaphysics. Metaphysics? Confirmed, sir. A rather peculiar limerick was being delivered in the shuttle-craft bay. I'm not sure I understand it. ""There was a young lady from Venus Whose body was shaped like a..."" Captain to Security, come in! Did I say something wrong? I don't understand their humor. Yeah, Captain? Get me Lt Yar! Keep your britches on! Capt Picard. Lieutenant, where are you? I'm in my quarters. I'm pretty busy right at the moment, Jean-Luc. Alright, Lieutenant, you just stay right there. Data, take Lt Yar down to sickbay. Aye, sir. Captain to Security. I want all your senior supervisors to report to the bridge immediately. Lt Yar? Here, Data. You wanted me? Capt Picard ordered me to escort you to sickbay, Lieutenant. Did he say when? I'm sure he meant now. So, you should get into uniform. But I got out of my uniform for you, Data. Do you know how old I was when I was abandoned? Chronological age? No. I'm afraid I am not familiar with... Five. Five years old. But I survived. I learned how to stay alive. How to avoid the rape gangs. I was 15 before I escaped. I am sorry. I did not know. And what I want now is gentleness. And joy. And love. From you, Data. You are fully functional? Of course, but... How fully? In every way, of course. I am programmed in multiple techniques. A broad variety of pleasuring. Oh, you jewel! That's exactly what I hoped. What have you learned? The engines are cut off from the bridge. An engineer pulled out the isolinear optical chips from command. All the engines are off line. Wesley has hooked up some kind of tractor beam to the ship's power, aimed at the door. We can't get past to get to the computer. Can you short out the power? Yes, I can. But it's gonna take time. Do it. Bill? Deanna, what? So many minds on this ship, all free. Released. Deanna. I can feel them all. What they want, what they feel. It's a side of humans I never felt before. Come on. I'm getting you to sickbay. Wouldn't you rather be alone with me? With me in your mind? The medical records we found say this works almost instantly. It's not fair, Doc. I've never seen a rainbow, sunset, sunrise. This is gonna help me? Help me see like you? Dr Crusher? Deanna needs your help. The formula didn't work. It may induce the same symptoms, but somehow, it's different. Maybe it's mutated. I have to isolate it to analyze it. We don't have time. You brought Deanna in. Then you touched her! Oh, God! And you touched me. I've got to quarantine you. If I don't get the computer on line, none of this will matter. We'll all be dead. Captain's log, supplemental. It is no longer an inconvenient, childish prank. Young Wesley Crusher, admittedly a victim of the Tsiolkovsky infection, is now in control of my starship. Wesley, this is Capt Picard. Do you see me? Yes, sir. You will return control of this vessel to the bridge where it belongs at once. I'm sorry, sir. Tell me what you want done and I'll do it! Ship captains control their own vessels, young man. But, sir, you don't do it yourself. You give the orders but somebody else does it. What's wrong with giving me the orders? Captain, getting unusual readings now from the dwarf star. Stand by on that for a moment. Wesley. Wes. Are you aware that you are behaving strangely, that a kind of infection was brought over from the Tsiolkovsky, which acts like... intoxication? Are you saying that's why I feel so hot? So strange? That's... That's a very adult bit of reasoning, Wesley. So, you mean I'm drunk! I feel strange, but also good. Because... you have lost the capacity for self-judgment. Now, alcohol does this, Wesley. The contaminant from the Tsiolkovsky does it even more so. What would you do if you got your ship back? Oh, it's very important I do, Wesley. I must lock a tractor beam on to the Tsiolkovsky and tow it... Tractor beams are my specialty. I'll get that done. Wesley out. Wesley! Where are you headed? Sir, the star. It's beginning to collapse. What the hell is happening in Engineering? Lock on. Lock on Tsiolkovsky. Where's that sonic driver? It's over there. OK, let's see if this cuts out his tractor beam power. Oh, come on. No! I must find the answer. I've got to find the answer. Captain, tractor beam. We just locked on to the Tsiolkovsky. Captain to... Wesley! Wesley Crusher, come in. Good, Data. At least you're functioning. Fully, Captain. Data, intoxication is a human condition. Your brain is different. It's not the same as... We're more alike than unlike, my dear Captain. I have pores. Humans have pores. I have... fingerprints. Humans have fingerprints. My chemical nutrients are like your blood. If you prick me, do I not... leak? Doctor... Captain, can I see you in your room? It's private. No, actually, it's urgent. But... Damn it! Now, Doctor... I have become infected myself. Do you know what the infection is? Come on, quickly. Sorry. It is definitely like alcohol intoxication. The same lack of good judgment. For example, right now, I find you extremely... Extremely... We haven't time for that sort of thing. What sort of thing? God, would I love to show you! Doctor, there must be a cure. Some formula... ...similar to the old one. Damn it, Captain! My dear Captain. You owe me something. You do realize that, don't you? I'm a woman. I haven't had the comfort of a husband, a man. Not now, Doctor. Please! Bridge to Riker. Urgent. Riker here. Sir. Regret to inform you that the Captain appears to be infected, and Data. Thank you, Lieutenant, I'm on my way. You'll have to handle this. Are you saying you're gonna handle that? What we're seeing is a huge chunk of the star surface blown away, heading for us. Take us... Are you alright, sir? Worf, you do know what to do. Take us, er... Take us out of here. Right. Controls are still off line, sir. Override. Same result, sir. Wes, come in, please. Wesley Crusher, this is Riker. This is urgent. Come in, please. Engineering, urgent. We must have ship's power. These are control chips. Bridge from Engineering. The star is collapsing. We're in the path... I can't help you. Someone yanked out the control chips. It was an adult who did it. I estimate 14 minutes until that mass gets here. No, sir, I cannot replace the chips in 14 minutes. Two hours, maybe. Data could assemble them faster. What's that? What's that, Wesley? They're simple isolinear chips to Data. He can shuffle them like cards. Come on, Data, hurry. Ship's log, First Officer Riker. Enterprise will be destroyed unless it is moved out of the path of the star material. Our only hope is for Lt Cmdr Data, in the time we have left, to reconnect engine power to the bridge. Nice to see you, Wesley. Hi, Mr. Data. Get the damn control chips back in place, in the correct order. Now! It's like a game. How fast can you do it? A game. I think I can switch this to main viewer, sir. Data, we've eight or nine minutes. Can you finish by then? No, this will take slightly more time than we have, sir. Damn it, no. I can't afford to get this. Beverly. Yes, Jean-Luc? You will address me as Captain. Captain? Well then, my dear Captain, you will address me as Chief Medical Officer, or Doctor. I will? That's true. I started out by calling you Beverly. Of course, naturally, you... I'm still not thinking straight. Likewise. Where the hell was I headed? If that's something you were going to test... Yes, on Geordi. Come here. See how I reversed the fields on this? I made it into a repulser beam. If we just had one minute more, sir. If this were a hundred times more powerful than it is... Why not try it with the real thing? Why not reverse fields? We need an extra minute. It would take weeks of laying out new circuits. Why not just see it in your head? Come off the main lead, split off at the force activator. Then... If I could just think straight about this. I made this a broader-based remedy. I hope. It's still very close to the formula from the old Enterprise records. Decades ago. Light years away. But almost exactly the same conditions as here. Wow! What was in that, Doctor? My head is beginning to clear. Come here. Take this to Engineering. I'll make up hypos for the others. OK, Bev. We're not gonna make it, Captain. If we only had a minute or so more. Then reverse in power leads, back through the force activator. Repulser beam hard against Tsiolkovsky. Don't you see? It's giving us a push-off. The extra time we need. We're pushing away. Bridge, engage engines. Captain, something seemed to move us aside at the last minute. Do we owe our thanks to Cmdr Data, sir? Yes, and Wesley may have given us a few seconds, too. Did he say Wesley? The boy? He said Wesley. It's only fair to mention Wesley in the log entry, sir. Fair's fair. Let's credit his science teacher, too. Congratulations, sir. To many people. Data, I'm only going to tell you this just once. It never happened. I put it to you all, I think we shall end up with a fine crew... ...if we avoid temptation. So, Number One, let's go to our next job. Aye, sir. Prepare for warp three. Headed 294, mark 37. Warp three, heading 294, mark 37, sir. Engage. "
S1E04,"Captain's log, stardate 41235.25. Our location, Planet Ligon II, source of a rare vaccine needed on Federation Planet Styris IV. Starfleet told me to engage in a friendly visit and open treaty negotiations to acquire this medicinal substance. Standard orbit, sir. Lt Yar calling from cargo bay one. Standing by to beam the Ligonian party aboard. On our way. You have the helm, Mr. Data. Cargo one. This should be interesting. Agreed. Not only are they closely humanoid, but their history is similar to ours. A highly structured society and they're exceedingly proud. They insist on using their own transporter, sir. It's their way. Do they have our coordinates? They have. They're standing by for your signal. This is Capt Picard aboard the Enterprise. Please do us the honor of visiting our vessel. I am Lutan. Capt Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome aboard. My officers. My second-in-command, Cmdr William Riker. Ship's Counselor, Deanna Troi. And my Security Officer, Lt Natasha Yar. A woman? Your Chief of Security? Yes, Lutan, that is her expertise. I am honored to meet your officers. This is my secondary, Hagon. A sample of the vaccine. My duty, Lutan. I'm required... Out of my way, woman! How interesting. May we prove as surprising to you. If I may suggest, sir, no apology. In their view, it would weaken us. Nothing concealed. Would you care to accept it? Unless you care to examine it further. Absolutely not. This vaccine sample is a gift of life. We are honored at receiving it. Would you do us the additional honor now of letting us entertain you? Yes. Please prepare it. We shall join you shortly. I ask forgiveness. They are strange, alien beings. You bear no fault. But the female? May be exactly what I have needed. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Lutan, we are aware of many of your planet's achievements, and its unique similarity to an ancient Earth culture we all admire. On behalf of the Federation, I would like to present this token of our gratitude and friendship. From China's Sung Dynasty. Fourteenth century. Thirteenth century, sir. Ah, yes, indeed. A most thoughtful gift. We are pleased. We of Ligon have been apprehensive about strangers. We're not technologically advanced as you. Yet, we possess something you do not. A vaccine, which has been found to be an effective antidote against your dreaded Anchilles fever. If you respect our customs, and we see that respect, we will be friends. And we will make the antidote available to all who need it. If you require respect from us, I am sure that you will see it. Surrounded by such friendship, I feel no need for my guards. I will return shortly. Prepare to transport me then. If there is anything else, any further courtesy? Would it be possible to see one of your wondrous holodecks? We have heard how they are used to train your officers. And for many other things. Cmdr Riker. Would you and Troi demonstrate? Would it be possible for Lt Yar to do so, Captain? Some demonstration of defense training. You're intrigued with her having security responsibilities. But these things are not unusual with us. With us, it is the duty of women only to own the land. And the duty of men to protect and rule it. Much the same has happened in human history, too. I'd like to do it, sir. As a sign of respect, perhaps. Very well. This way, please. Aikido one. It won't move again until my actions activate it. You can create people? Without a soul? It's not a real person, Lutan. It has no life. Everything it does is controlled by computer. Who am I? Do you hear me? But it will feel real when it hits you. A force like that cannot come from an image, Lutan. Then you will show me, Hagon. Thank you, Lieutenant. How very enlightening. Aikido, vanish. I could create two, even three. But, really, one is enough. As you fight with it, it learns how to defeat you. Even the extraordinary Lt Yar? It forces us to keep improving. Your skill... impresses me. I like you. Farewell, my new friends of the noble Enterprise. Understanding has made friends of many different people. We've had a good beginning. May I also extend a personal farewell to Lt Yar. In your Federation terms... Picard to bridge. Red alert. Shields up, photon torpedoes activated, sir. What comm contact have we had? Their orbital control station. Make contact there and on hailing frequencies. This is the Enterprise to Lutan and the Ligonian government. You have committed an unfriendly act. Insist you reply immediately. Photon torpedoes ready. Set them for a display blast 1,000 meters short of the surface. Set. Fire. Where is their transporter beam? We've tried to trace it, sir, but to no effect. It's similar to early Starfleet efforts, but uses the Heglenian shift to convert energy and matter in... Which is actually not important at this time. This is Capt Picard with a message to Lutan, whom I have so far acknowledged as a friend. But you have now committed what our laws regard as an attack upon us. Since you have visited our vessel, you know the power of it. We insist that you reply to this message. Opinion, Counselor. Will they injure Lt Yar? I believe not, sir. They seem mainly curious. In the case of Lutan, however, I did feel other needs. What kind of needs? Some sexual attraction from all the males. Lt Yar is physically very attractive. But with Lutan, I felt something else. Something more like avarice or ambition. Other comments? If I may, sir? One of the things in the briefings was their respect for patience. Strongly emphasized. You can see it in the precise, ritualistic way they do things. I'm worried about Lt Yar, too, sir. But maybe we should wait them out. Stardate 41235.32. I am concerned. Over a full day of waiting with no response from Lutan. We are testing whether they are aware of our sensors probing them. We believe we have pinpointed Lutan's government compound. The vaccine, sir. Yes, Doctor? The vaccine. I'm a physician, I've seen death, but not on the scale this could mean. You were testing if you could replicate the vaccine. And we can't. The sample works fine as an injection, but it becomes unstable when we try to replicate it. You must get the vaccine from the planet. As much as you can. Immediately. I'm aware of that, Doctor. You've never had to watch a patient die from this. That's true. But I have seen my share of death. Damn. Where are the calluses we doctors are meant to grow over our feelings? Perhaps the good ones never get them. May I speak to you about my son, Wesley? What? Oh, yes. Alright. He's interested in starship operations. Speaking as a mother, of course, he seems quite knowledgeable. Well, yes, speaking as a mother. He's on the turbolift. Remember, you ordered him to stay off of the bridge. Wesley? I haven't stepped one foot on your bridge, Captain. Sir, I'll see that he leaves immediately. No. No? Why don't you sit at ops next to Lt La Forge? Sir? Is the whole ship deaf? Sit down over there, young man. Temporarily. Captain, we have more information from the briefing studies on Ligon. Oh, excuse me. Dr Crusher, some of this may interest you. Let's hear the analysis. It is a highly structured society. People live by strict codes. What Lutan did is similar to what American Indians once did called counting coup. That is from an obscure language known as French. Mr. Data, the French language, for centuries on Earth, represented civilization. Indeed? But surely, sir... I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Yes, sir. Counting coup could be touching an enemy with a stick, or taking something from him and escaping. It was considered extremely heroic. Lutan considers himself heroic, risking everything in the face of our superior power. It fits Lutan's personality profile as well. He has an abnormally high need for achievement. Self-image to him is a function of what he thinks he's achieved. Those who set their standards too high can kill to meet them. Why Tasha? As a Starfleet Security Officer, she represented his riskiest prize. Transmission from planet surface. Main viewer on. Well, Lutan, what do you want? Display your image, please. What is required is an image of Lt Yar, well and... Are you making demands, Captain? Sir. According to the Ligon code of honor, Lutan has done what he set out to do, achieve recognition for being daring and bold. We've studied this in some depth now, sir. The proper thing for you to do now is to ask to get Tasha back. Ask for her? Politely, Captain. And now, Lutan, you have boldly taken Lt Yar from us. We ask that... That you now please return her. Then come visit us, Captain. And we shall return her to you. Commander. Commander? That's quite formal. So is this request, sir. We believe it would be preferable if the Captain led this away party. Agreed, sir. Their customs about guests make it preferable. I'm very much against that idea. Lutan is clearly a liar, and devious. Counselor Troi believes he is capable of killing. It is my duty to keep the Captain from danger. But Ligonian custom makes it clear that a visiting leader is an honored guest. Not us, not second-in-command. Him. And the custom requires that Lutan should die rather than violate that. Yes, it seems reasonable, put that way. But I warn you, if you get hurt, I'll put you on report, Captain. Welcome to my centerplace, Capt Picard. Consider yourselves my honored guests. Every hospitality will be accorded you. This is my first one, Yareena. Lutan is a fortunate man. You've met Counselor Troi. As on your vessel, you have only to name whatever courtesy we can provide. Then, sir, the courtesy of seeing Lt Yar. Lt Yar will be returned to you tonight at a banquet I have arranged in your honor. I'd like to see her now. Bring Lt Yar. I find it odd that a man of your experience has such difficulty in understanding ordinary politeness. The politeness of saying please before abducting someone? The expression ""please"" is used only when requesting the person back. Yours is a different world. With clear and simple ways deeply rooted in our culture. If you are willing to ask for Lt Yar's return tonight, in front of all, honor will be satisfied. One can see the importance of honor here, sir. Honor is everything. Have you been treated well, Lieutenant? Fine, Captain. But they're showing some signs of wear. There isn't any need for concern. She's been well cared for. My ship's company and I are certain of your wisdom in that. For a moment, I thought I heard a threat implied. But that would be foolishness. Something to be avoided, I agree. The festivities for her return to you are in preparation. Shall we retire till then? Until tonight, Lutan. You have granted us hospitality and the safety of your centerplace. The gifts you give us are rare and precious. We thank you. And now, according to the customs of your ancestors, whom we honor and respect... ...I am here in peace to ask for the return of Lt Yar. Well spoken. There are those among my equals here who were wary of my approaching the Federation. I am proud to have taken this step toward a treaty. And proud that we have something of great value to offer you. A priceless, life-giving vaccine. The abduction I have done according to our custom for all to see. Your conduct in this matter has been beyond exemplary, Capt Picard. But now that the moment has come, I find that I cannot part with her. You speak of a code of honor. But what you are saying now, by our customs, is an act of war. This is not an act of war, but of love. I want Lt Yar to become my first one. I challenge your right to supersede. No woman has challenged for 200 years! The right is mine and I will have it! Natasha Yar, I challenge you. A struggle to the death. No! The challenge is unequivocally refused. Then you shall have no treaty, no vaccine, and no Lt Yar! Ship's log, First Officer Riker reporting. We have been informed of the challenge to Lt Yar and are maintaining combat readiness. We are probing Lutan's compound with our sensors, still unnoticed. Captain. Deanna. Did you have any idea that Lutan was going to announce that he wanted you for his first one? No, sir. Tell me what you know about this. Nothing, sir. But it was a thrill. Lutan is such... such a basic male image. And having him say he wants you... Yes, of course, it made me feel good, when he... Troi, I'm your friend, and you tricked me! Only so you'd think about it, completely and clearly. We're all being manipulated, Lieutenant. Myself most of all. How simple all this would be without the Prime Directive. That thought had passed through my mind. What is this message from Starbase 14? It's showing the infection rates, percentage illness increases. The plague on Styris IV has flared up out of control. They're estimating deaths in the millions, sir. Capt Picard, come in. I know I can win. Not that I'd take her life, of course. But I'd be glad to embarrass her. The idea of accusing me of taking... The plague? If anything, even worse than we've heard. So they desperately need the vaccine, sir. And I know I can win this challenge. You have nothing to prove here. But the vaccine is important in this case, sir. You're the last person I'd expect to argue for taking the challenge. Betazoid blood is also practical, Captain. The odds are very good. She'd defeat Lutan's wife easily. You'd win all the bargaining points you need. The odds are... You have pointed out yourself, we are all at risk, every day of every mission. I want some explanation from Lutan. Lutan, why are you so obsessed with this Lt Yar? Surely Yareena is more desirable. Certainly, she can offer you much more. She owns many things, many lands. It's a pity you began by abducting my Security Officer, Lutan. Because I should tell you, I do admire the hospitality you offer here. I am in the grip of forces you do not understand. Some of it I do understand. She is a rather lovely female. You surprise me, Captain. What do you know of needs and feelings? Nothing. Well, almost nothing, in my position as ship's Captain. I see. But it puzzles me. If you feel like that for Tasha, why challenge her to a fight to the death? Not I. Yareena. I am merely a spectator. Ah, but you are also a man of great importance and wealth. Great importance, perhaps, but he does... Ah, I see. You, too, understand the proper value of women. We understand that they are highly pleasant things, but, after all, unimportant. Except for the land they own. You are a truly clever person, Lutan. You stand to lose nothing, either way the challenge goes. A code of honor protects one, Captain, like a magic cloak. I will order Lt Yar to fight. And may your cloak bring you all you deserve. Come in. Why that razor, not the one I adjusted to perfect efficiency? Shaving is a human art form, Data. Technological perfection can shave too close. Puzzling. How can anything be too efficient? Thousands of things are too efficient for humans. We always come back to the human equation. Exactly. Have you continued to work on it? Constantly, my friend. Particularly the humor. A man goes to a store to buy kidneys. He says to the shopkeeper, ""I'd like a pound of kiddleys."" The shopkeeper says, ""You mean kidneys."" The man says, ""I said kiddleys, diddle I?"" It's too old. And you didn't tell it very well. How do you know when something is funny? It's not explainable. You just do. Perhaps it is you, Geordi. Includling the kiddleys, I've told 662 jokes and you've not... ""Includling the kiddleys."" Now, see, that's funny. It was not meant as a joke. The tongue slipped. Oh, boy. Riker to Cmdr Data, Lt La Forge. Report to the transporter room for away-party duty. First Officer to Captain. Ready with the away personnel. Lock in on this location. Locked in, sir. Energize. You saw the news about the plague? And how badly the vaccine is needed. We need to know as much as possible about Ligonian armaments. Data, analyze their combat capabilities. Geordi, concentrate on their cutting edges, durability, weaknesses in material. Aye, sir. From any particular point of view? From the perspective of Lt Yar using them in combat with Lutan's wife. Most interesting. Could this be human joke number 663? Negative, Data. That's a Captain's order. Which makes it important to know which weapons are to be used. That won't be known until combat begins. You're right, Data. It does sound like a joke. With the power of the Enterprise, we could overwhelm this place, just take what we want. I may not understand humor, sir, but I am a Starfleet Academy graduate. Which means, of course? Understanding the Prime Directive. That is, ironically, what this is about. By our standards, the customs here, their code of honor, is the same pompous, strutting charades that endangered our species a few centuries ago. We evolved out of it because no one tried to impose their own set of... Sorry. This is becoming a speech. You're the Captain. You're entitled. Not entitled to ramble on about something everyone knows. Carry on. Ship's log, Cmdr William Riker reporting. Continuing our appraisal of Ligonian technology, the Captain wants Lt Yar beamed to safety if her life becomes endangered. I fervently hope the rules of that contest make it possible. Riker to Transporter Chief. Do we have our people on sensors yet? Their general area, sir. Visual on screen now. As you see, we're still doing some fine-tuning. I've agreed to this meeting, but I see no point to it. You accepted the challenge. You should know there is no physical training that matches Starfleet, especially its Security people. And you should know that even though these contests are rare, we make ourselves capable of them. Yareena, my acceptance had nothing to do with Lutan. It has! Lutan wants you to be his first one. Impossible, Yareena. I am a career Starfleet officer. How could you not love him? Every woman loves him. I fight for the vaccine. That's the truth. The truth is I will kill you if I can. And believe me, I can. There's nothing else to say! In my world, it's a greater honor to refuse. You are on our world! Captain. I'm your Counselor. You brought me with you to Ligon to be of help. Then help me, please. What is a way out of this? With the vaccine? Mm-hm. None. The weapons in that room are surprisingly flexible, durable and deadly. And light. As if they were made for women to use. Some still have traces of blood and poison. Poison? Alkaloid base. Lethal. What about those lengths of metal in the yard? Uncertain, sir. However, joined together, they would make a rectangle or square enclosing 121 square meters. Vertically, they would make a pole 44 meters high. Or two of 22. Thank you, Data. You're welcome, sir. She won't budge. She loves him, without reservation. And she thinks I love him, too. Most interesting. Do you? Of course I don't, Data! As Troi pointed out, I'm attracted to him, but that's different. Riker to Captain. Go ahead, Riker, we're alone. We can see your hosts gathering in the open area outside, sir. Three of them are heading for your location. Thank you, Number One. Lieutenant, do you still want to go through with this challenge? Do you judge your condition good? I judge it excellent, sir. Your weapons, Lt Yar. You may choose your size. Don't touch the spines. They're poisoned. If you're not careful, you could kill yourself. These I understand. First Officer's log supplemental. Capt Picard, faced with a critical need for a vaccine, has permitted Lt Natasha Yar to engage in a fight to the death. I have yet to understand his reasoning or his plan. Care to lend a hand? Sit at ops. Was I seen leaving? They've got eyes only for the program. Capt Picard wanted no risk of our being overheard. You are to proceed as he indicated. Captain's orders two! Did the Captain understand what you and Geordi reported? The weapons are split-second lethal. I'm here to brief you on what he plans. Any last-minute instructions, sir? Stay alive. We'll hope to do the rest. I speak for Lutan. The rules are known. Let combat continue until there is a victor. It will not be interrupted. Combatants, hold your positions. Return the weapon. Careful, Yareena! Move! We're too late. She's growing cold. Sorry, that clashes with my instructions. Oh, no! Exactly what do you find unfair, Lutan? They fought to the death. You saw the final blow. You know the effects of your poison. But what of your Lt Yar? She is to become my first one now. I won't stop her, if she cares to claim that honor. Remember, you have all Yareena's wealth and lands now. At least all has not been lost. Riker to Captain. Picard here. Since you fulfilled your agreement, can we now beam the vaccine aboard? Yes, of course. No problem, Number One. Send down a medical team. And to complete our business here, we are locked on to you. Five to beam up. Energize. Welcome back, Captain. You're wanted in the lounge. This way, gentlemen. She is not dead! There was no death combat! You violated our agreement! There will be no treaty, no vaccine! The challenge was carried out. She died, Lutan. There was no challenge. She lives! I am a physician and saw her die. If you doubt this poison, why not test it on yourself? Lutan, we can provide you with records of her death, and how Dr Crusher brought her back. At the instant of death, Lutan, our mating agreement dissolves. But this is witchcraft, Yareena. To discard a mate in this manner... Is less painful than the one you selected for me. Yareena, no. Even as I battled, Hagon, I heard you calling out for me. Yareena, be my first one. All my land and all my goods, all I have is yours to rule. How sad for you. You've lost everything. I have my honor. It's... such a waste. Do you want him? No. There would... be complications. Then I will have you as my number two. Take your place accordingly. Well, as you see, Captain, you may excel in technology, but not in civilized behavior. What? Wesley. Young Wesley has been manning that station for me. I forgot. Well... thanks again for manning one of our bridge stations, Wesley. We'll see that you have another chance. Yes, sir. What's the delay? Why aren't we warping out of here? Set course for Styris IV, warp three. Course laid in for Styris IV, sir. Engage. "
S1E05,"Captain's log, stardate 41386.4. We're in pursuit of a starship of Ferengi design. Our mission is to recover a T-9 energy converter which the Ferengi stole from an unmanned post on Gamma Tauri IV. A theft which scanners recorded, providing us with the opportunity to make close contact with a Ferengi vessel. If we succeed, it will be Starfleet's first look at a life form which, discounting rumor, we know almost nothing about. There she is. Enlarge. What is their course? They're angling through that solar system. Identify. Listed as Delphi Ardu, sir. 11 planets. Unexplored. Stay with them, La Forge. Power surge from their last maneuver. They are dropping to subwarp speed. Reduce to impulse power. Fluctuations in energy readings from it, Captain. Possibility, a malfunction in their engines. Breaks my heart. In visual range, Captain. Fully enlarge. Hello, stranger. Very impressive design. Anything on that design, Data? Nothing specific, sir. Ferengi technology is estimated to be equal to our own. But that does not mean identical, however. Correct. We will be advanced in some areas, they in others. Another power surge, sir. They are firing on us. Damage report? Shields holding. Mostly electromagnetic. Fusion generator down by 30 percent. Our impulse engines are surging. They're firing again. Deflector-shield power weakening. Phasers ready. Photon torpedoes ready. Do we return their fire, sir? Negative. They're just responding to our close pursuit. Fall back a bit, but stay with them. They're slowing. They may be turning to fight. Open hailing... Why are we gaining on them? Don't anticipate. I'm not, sir. Something is dragging us forward. I read that, too. Lt Yar, what do your sensors show? Not certain, sir. I'm getting very confusing readings. Captain, this shouldn't be. Our power systems are failing. Deflector shield failing. Phasers going inoperative. Something is completely immobilizing us. Immobilized by the damn Ferengi. We need more information. What the hell are they using? Obviously, we underestimated their technology. Considerably. The Ferengi have us right where they want us. In their sights. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Are you searching all frequencies? Any message? Negative, sir. Weapons report. Phasers and torpedoes are armed, but I show insufficient power to fire them. Engineering, give me status on power recovery. Engineering, come in. Why aren't they answering? La Forge, get a report from Engineering. Aye, sir. It's impossible they could be draining all power from all systems. Counselor? I'm sensing nothing from them, sir. It could mean they can shield their thoughts and emotions from others. So it's our move. They may know as little about us as we do about them. They know they've got us in deep trouble. If so, then what do they do with that knowledge? Data, do you have any information on this on any file? None. Only hearsay and third-hand reports, most of which conflict. Which reports do not conflict? That the Ferengi are... The best description may be traders. What kind of traders? Scholars of Earth history liken the Ferengi to the ocean-going Yankee traders of 18th- and 19th-century America. From the history of my forebears. Yankee traders. Who search the galaxy for mercantile and territorial opportunity. Are scholars saying that the Ferengi may be like us? Hardly, sir. The analogy refers to the worst quality of capitalists. The Ferengi conduct their affairs of commerce on the ancient principle caveat emptor. ""Let the buyer beware."" Yankee traders. I like that. Well, I doubt they wear red, white and blue, or look like Uncle Sam. Engineering? Join La Forge in Engineering, Number One. Aye, sir. Without warp capacity, we're just a floating target. Uncle who? What have primary colors got to do with it? I understand the allusion. Colors representing countries at a time when they competed. Red, white and blue for the United States. Whereas the French more properly used the same colors in the order blue, white and red. The Germans, red, black and gold. The Italians, green, white and red. That's enough, Data. It was you who... We were discussing the Ferengi. I wish I had a clue what they will do next. Given what is happening to our ship, their weapons could be vastly superior to ours. Yes, Data, that is a natural assumption. Engineering? Bottom line? Not good, sir. Their force field compensates almost as fast as we can increase power. There's a 0.372 millisecond delay between the use of our power and the counter force of the Ferengi. See, we push and they push back with equal force, sir. What's our delay between slow-reverse impulse and top warp speed? That's 0.300 milliseconds. There's... I see where you're going. We shift down, then kick hard into warp nine. Come back fighting! Can we do it? Ask me after it's done, sir. I want a slow reverse into drop-off over five minutes. We'll show 'em, sir. Give me everything you've got. Aye-aye, sir. In an abrupt power surge to high warp speed, we may be able to break loose from that Ferengi force field. I wish I knew what they were thinking. They're wondering what we'll do next. I say fight. There's no shame in falling before a superior enemy. And no shame in a strategic retreat either. All systems ready. Communication is restored to Engineering. Excellent, La Forge. Now, let's... throw them off guard. Lt Yar, open hailing frequencies. Hailing frequencies open, sir. At least we won't begin with weakness. Attention, Ferengi starship. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise. In the name of the Federation, I demand that you return the T-9 energy converter you removed from Gamma Tauri IV. Send that in all language forms. All language forms, sir. Sometimes, the best way to fight is not to be there. Yes, sir. ""He will triumph who knows when to fight and when not to fight."" I'm glad the Academy still teaches the strategies of Sun Tzu. This delay had better prove out. 0.300 milliseconds, sir. Let's blast full power into warp nine. Ready? On your command, Captain. On the count of three. Stand by on phasers. One, set warp to nine. Two, divert shield power to main engines. Three... Merde. Shields up. Captain, I think you had better see this. What's wrong? Someone is reading every file in the Enterprise memory banks. They can do that? And more, perhaps. Captain, if I may recommend...? With our attention on the Ferengi vessel, we have ignored the planet. Data, consult the charts on this planet. See what we've got on it. Conference evaluation. So, it's time for difficult decisions. Opinions, please. I say put all power into a combined phaser and torpedo salvo. Destroy their ability to sustain this force field. Yes, hit them hard, and hit them fast. Impractical... and provocative. Even assuming we have power to sustain such a tactic. But firing on us is an act of war. The facts are, the Ferengis did fire on us, but we were chasing them. Since then, all they've done is search our computers to learn what we are. Your point? Let's talk to them. It's been tried. No response. But did we tell them anything they wanted to hear? Other opinions? Thank you for your advice. Will? I haven't had your assessment. I believe we've covered every available option, Captain. Are there other options you want to analyze? The only one left is the one that needs no conversation. The one we must avoid. Sir? The one that leads to total annihilation. Open hailing frequencies. Open, sir. Attention, Ferengi starship. This is Captain Picard. It is obvious that we are in a situation which needs resolving. We are willing to do whatever is... required, whatever is necessary. I would like... I would request... that you present your terms to us. Captain's log, stardate 41386.5. It is with a heavy heart that I have offered to meet any reasonable terms demanded by the Ferengi. I fear for my people and vessel in the event that the unknown Ferengi ask the unreasonable. How can I oppose even unreasonable demands? It's moving, sir. We ask to surrender. Now they fire on us? Ready torpedoes. We have enough power for a few. Ready, but hold on ready. Open hailing frequencies. Hailing frequencies open, sir. Ferengi vessel, we await your response. Suggest first strike, sir. Our shields now only have 63 seconds of power left. If their sensors can read us, they will wait until we are most vulnerable. I agree. They have not responded. Wait a bit more. 50 seconds. Patience. The quicker we can come to terms, the better, NCC- 17O 1D. Who is speaking? I am Tarr, DaiMon of the Ferengi. You wish to discuss surrender, Capt Picard? What I said, DaiMon Tarr, is... Unconditional surrender, I warn you, is totally unacceptable. We will die to the last one of us before such dishonor. Hailing frequencies closed. Something has seized their ship too. They're in the same predicament. Launch a sensor probe. Set it to search for whatever it is that is holding both ships. Go back to hailing frequency, fast. ...and I regret, DaiMon Tarr, that I can no longer negotiate unless it is conducted visually. Your complete message not received, but visual communication is against our custom. It is against Starfleet orders to accept a surrender otherwise. Do you withdraw your surrender? You give us no choice, Enterprise. May we have a visual on you as well? Agreed, DaiMon Tarr. You should be able to view us now. Are we on your screen? Yes. The ugliness of the human was not an exaggeration. I do not know how you have paralyzed our vessel. I concede your Enterprise is superior. We will return your T-9. We offer the lives of our second officers as required by the Ferengi code. Fortunately, Starfleet has no such rules for its second officers. Is this to your satisfaction, Picard? Your offer may be inadequate, but I will discuss it with my staff. Stand by for further communication. Matthew, Pola, you know this area is off limits. Come on. Boys will be boys. Have you launched the probe? Aye. We'll get the readings soon. If we're not holding the Ferengi, and they're not holding us, who is? The probe will give us some answers. Data, you were going to show us something. As requested, library computer information on this planet. It has been charted only from long-range scans. It is Class-M, but shows no life forms, sentient or otherwise. However, you may find this of interest. Resolving it into our language. The centre of a huge space federation, a population of trillions. Trillions? I've never heard the word ""Tkon"" before. Understandable. It has been extinct for 600,000 of our... ...of our years. These planets were once outposts of that empire. Data, what are you doing? Apologies, Captain. I seem to have reached an odd... functional impasse. I am... stuck. Get unstuck and continue the briefing. That is what I am trying to do, sir, but the solution eludes me. My hero! Continue, Commander. Intriguing. It des... It describes the empire as being highly advanced and powerful, and capable of actually moving stars. Stars whose planets are their defense system? Correct, sir. Outposts. The planet below was possibly one of them. Excuse the interruption, but this is worth it. We're receiving a signal from the probe. We'll take it here. Incredible. There's our mysterious something. It is a force field of some kind. Reaching up from the planet surface. Amazing power. What does the legend say about the end of the Tkon Empire? Their sun went supernova. Could this planet have escaped? It may have been the most distant outpost, but it shows no life-form readings. Let's take a look. Stand by with an away team. And if the Ferengi realize the field's from the planet? That's a complication. We should ask them to join us. Team up with the Ferengi? We've been ordered to learn about them. Do you know a better way? Captain's log, supplemental. In orbit of a planet whose unexplained force field has seized us with a power almost beyond imagination. Any solution to this will almost certainly involve cooperation from the Ferengi. Ship's power drain is critical. I must shut down shields to maintain life support. Understood. Open hailing frequencies. Hailing frequencies open, sir. Ferengi vessel from Enterprise, come in. Your alien images again shock us. About the surrender, the facts are different. Our own probe has shown us your trickery, human. We withdraw our surrender. Agreed. Perhaps you would agree to a more productive relationship? I'd prefer a more profitable one, human. Yankee trader. Explain what means Yankee traders! He heard that. He recognizes your interest in profit. Or is that incorrect? We seek only what is equitable. What do you seek? Why did you attack us? We did not attack. We gave chase to recover a Federation energy device... Which is ours! Your Federation placed it on one of our planets. No, Gamma Tauri IV is recognized by all civilized... The Ferengi are not uncivilized. Are you suggesting otherwise? All I'm saying is that you removed something which did not belong to you. Are you now calling us thieves? On the contrary, I have no wish to discuss property or territory while our mutual problem remains. Like it or not, we are both trapped by this energy-draining force field from the planet. On that matter there can be no argument. I would like to propose a swap. And what is a swap? It's a trade, an exchange. Yes, trade, human. What do you offer? We will tell you what we know about the planet. In trade, you give us your information. How do we know you will not withhold information? We must trust each other, Tarr. Amusing, human. Trust each other? I propose that we test this relationship by cooperating in a joint exploration of the planet's surface. And what profit is in this? The profit, DaiMon Tarr, of saving all our lives. We will agree, no doubt foolishly, but any trickery on your part will meet with no mercy. Agreed. If you care to join us, our transporter device... We have a device of our own. We will beam a science team of three to coordinates you can propose. We will transmit the information shortly. Enterprise out. Hailing frequencies off. I would log that agreement as promising, at least. I wonder, Captain. I don't usually distrust on sight, but this is an exception. Especially in view of the fact that his transmission was distorted. I sensed the same thing, Captain. He's hiding something. With the power drain, we can't delay. I'd like additional help. Can you spare Worf? Take him. And... be careful, Number One. With the power drain, communication may be hard. Understood. Anything else? The force field means we cannot beam back. You had to ask. Understood. Energize. Anybody? What are you doing up there? Most intriguing, sir. I assume inaccurately transmitted coordinates due to the force field around the ship, sir. Are we alone, sir? Unfortunately. Let's find the others. What do you make of these? Crystalline. Mostly inert. Nothing to write home about. Excuse me? Slang, sir. I did use it correctly, did I not? They have to be around here somewhere. What's that? What? Are you conscious? Do I look conscious? What are you doing? Resting, sir! My foot's stuck. Up there. I materialized upside down above the planet's surface. Tricorder's useless. Communication's gone too. Fortunately, you did not break... Data, who's that? Who are you? Captain's log, supplemental. It is six hours since our away team beamed down to the planet. On the Enterprise, our condition is rapidly worsening. Ordinarily, with reserve power, we could maintain life support for several months. But the force holding us has closed down all engines and is draining our reserve power, too. It's getting colder, sir. How far down is it likely to go? A lot. Even in orbital space it'll get below minus 200 degrees. You won't have to worry much past minus 70 or so. Feels like that now. Good. Thank you. If he moves, kill him. Letek, we have broken our agreement with their captain. We will accuse the humans of preparing to ambush us. It will be our word against theirs. And who is more trustworthy, Mordoc? It looks like gold. Tastes like gold. It is gold. Accursed planet! It's nothing to what our Captain will do for breaking our agreement. What part of the agreement? You appeared and attacked us. Are you one of their assassins? I'm Cmdr William Riker, First Officer of the USS Enterprise. You have a lot to learn. I got this one! Careful, they are much stronger than... Pygmy cretins! Kill them! Hideous monsters! No! Good. You've heard of phasers. Now, over there. Is this a female? A human female, Letek? Yes, it is true. You work with your females, arm them and force them to wear clothing. Sickening! I've diverted the reserve power to the family decks. They'll last longest. Is there anything else we can do, Doctor? Where's Wesley? He's in our quarters. I considered giving him a sedative. You shouldn't. I know, but he's my son. I love him. He has the right to meet death awake. Is that a male perspective? Rubbish. Hold it right there! Stop. Phasers on stun. Already set. What's going on? What is this? We can deduce that these crystalline tree shapes are actually energy collectors. On the same principle as that which is draining energy from our ships. The Ferengi whips were working earlier. So something new has happened. I'm beginning to understand what my eyes are showing me. It's patterns of force everywhere. This entire planet has been turned into a power accumulator. These are the point of this place. I can see power emanating... Commander. Be you barbarians? Speak! Who meets the challenge? Who will it be? Him. You have awakened Portal 63. Do you petition to enter the Empire? Who asks the question? A guardian of the Tkon Empire. Biped. Excellent. Why would we petition to enter... an empire that no longer exists? Why do you attempt this deception? The Empire is for ever. Your empire fell prey to a supernova. We are for ever. Data, please repeat the file. It is a matter of record. In the Age of Makto, the central star of the Tkon Empire destabilized. There has never been an Age of Makto. In fact, many ages have come and passed since Makto. It is the Age of Bastu. I'm afraid not. According to the Tkon use of the galactic motionary startime charts, after Bastu came Cimi, Xora, Makto... Enough! Absurdities. You must have been asleep for hundreds of thousands of our years. Deception is the way of the human. We Ferengi will gladly make a petition. We invite your petition. Speak! We wish to offer our services to serve the Tkon Empire at no profit. Return control of our starship to us and we will happily destroy the human criminals and their vessel which attacked us without provocation. They came to loot your empire, but we intercepted them. You are accused of deceit and treachery. Do you give yourself up for judgment? Yes. If you believe these accusations, then act on them. And there is even more. We can prove that the humans are destroyers of legal commerce, and that they withhold vital technology from backward worlds. And necessary defensive weapons, too. We Ferengi now challenge this human madness! I admit, we withheld modern technologies from some worlds. You see? They are demented. Their values are insane. They have destroyed business opportunities. Proof of their barbarism! They adorn themselves with gold, a despicable use of a valuable metal. And they shamelessly clothe their females, inviting others to unclothe them, the very depth of perversion. Paws off, Ferengi! No female, human or Ferengi, can order Mordoc around. Submit! Just try it, shorty. At ease, Lieutenant. And we still have more faults. Starfleet has permitted several civilizations to fall. We have allowed the strong to overcome the weak. They admit their crimes. Hear them! They admit the evil that they do. Barbarian! Yes, you show wisdom. Barbarians all! But this one first... ...in the fashion the Empire has always challenged savages. No! For battle, come to me! No! That's an order. You have a single chance for life. One only. What is the answer to my challenge? I offer a thought. ""He will triumph who knows when to fight and when not to fight."" You are being tested, Riker. What is the answer? How do you know my name? You are facing fate with composure. But what is the answer to my challenge? Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Unlike these little ones who close their minds, your mind holds interesting thoughts. ""Know your enemy and know yourself, and you will always be victorious."" Why that thought? And who is this Sun Tzu you revere? An old Chinese philosopher from ancient Earth history. Tell me more of this wisdom, so much like our own. Gladly, but first our starship. Can you release it? It is released. All power is restored. Not a moment too soon, Jean. I mean, Captain. I had my doubts as your ships battled each other, in acts of belligerence. Normally I would destroy all of you, and your ships. But something confused me. Which was? First, you wanted to destroy each other. Then you agreed to assist each other. What of our vessel? We knew the same answer. The truth is, I gave those words to this human. What of them? Shall I destroy them? Then they would learn nothing. A most interesting conclusion. But what if they never learn, Riker? Is this a test also? In life, one is always tested. I see them much as we were several hundred years ago, but possessing the technology they now have, they are dangerous. Untrue. We seek friendship with you. But we can hardly hate what we once were. They may grow and learn. And learn ways to destroy you. Our values require us to face that possibility. What of you, with your empire gone? The universe exists to me to create life. I shall sleep... until needed again. Compliments, Lieutenant. Lt Worf. You've done well. Something to write home about. ""Something to write home about""? That's very human. The T-9 has been beamed aboard securely. The Ferengi complained, but one final roar from Portal convinced them. I commend your performance. One final request, sir. Permission to beam a box of Data's Chinese finger puzzles over to the Ferengi. A thank you for all they tried to do. Make it so. Set course, La Forge. "
S1E06,"Captain's log, stardate 41263.1. We have rendezvoused with the USS Fearless. A Starfleet propulsion expert and his assistant are beaming over to conduct tests on the Enterprise's engines. They have made similar adjustments on two other Starfleet vessels. I don't understand your concern. They're not authorized to make alterations. They will run tests on different ways of entering warp speed, and different formulas. Where's the harm? It's the specs Kosinski sent us. They're gibberish. Gibberish? Mr. Data, would you explain? We put Mr. Kosinski's specs into the computer and ran a test. There was no improvement in performance. So explain why the same tests on the USS Ajax and the Fearless resulted in an increase in propulsion. Our engines are new, sir. Top condition. The tests on older ships may have fixed some inefficiency. Bridge from transporter. Two from USS Fearless are ready to beam over. Stand by. Mr. Riker's on his way. Aye, sir. You're concerned about these tests... Yes, sir. If I may, I'll ask Counselor Troi to look these visitors over. Very good. Welcome aboard, Mr. Kosinski. I'm Cmdr William Riker. Where is the Captain, please? He's engaged in other duties. His engines should be the Captain's concern. They are, which is why the First Officer is responsible for an engine's performance. Guided, of course, by a Chief Engineer, Lt Cmdr Argyle. Nice to meet you. I appreciated receiving your specs. To which you have many questions? Aye, I have. You, sir, are...? Mr. Kosinski's assistant. My actual name is unpronounceable by humans. You're from Tau Alpha C. That's very distant. All approved and described in the Starfleet communications. I will set up in the engine room. Our Chief Engineer will show you the way. No need. I know my way around starships. One thing Kosinski's not hiding is bad disposition! Agreed. Also, he's arrogant, overbearing, self-important, and very sure of himself and his ability. And his assistant? He's the puzzle. With most life forms, I can usually feel something. I may not be able to understand it, but I feel something, if only a presence. With him, nothing. Empty space. It's as though he isn't even here. Something about this concerns me. I can point to no reason yet. Stay concerned, please. The safety of the Enterprise may be entrusted to these two. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. I shall begin my first test in precisely 15 minutes. Why is this child here? He's doing a school project. There are some questions. First... To save myself time, let me ask those questions for you. You received the information from Starfleet, fed it into your computer as precisely as humanly possible. You did a controlled test. Then, to your astonishment, nothing happened. So, you said, ""What's going on? This doesn't work!"" ""Kosinski's a fraud!"" I have had this conversation on other vessels. They didn't understand it. Why should you? You're saying it's unexplainable? I'm saying I'm not a teacher. Nor do I wish to be one. I have neither the inclination nor the time. You have all the time you need. I don't think you understand. It has been approved by Starfleet. It hasn't been approved by the Chief Engineer or me. I didn't know that was necessary. Now, you do. Perhaps I should speak to Capt Picard. If you like. It won't change anything. How basic shall I be? I'll leave that to you. Would you get on the auxiliary panel? To save time, my assistant is going to lay in my base formulas more rapidly than any human being could, even myself. Here, then, in the simplest possible terms, is what I do. This warp-drive system has been tuned only in the grossest sense, at least according to my standards. What I do is specific. Thank you. Well, sufficient to say for now that these symbols... Something troubles you with the way this is configured? How about it now? Yes... But shouldn't these be connected? Here... ...and here. Now will it do what Kosinski says it will? It has a chance. It might work better... this way. Yes. View this screen as we consider this. Now, is this merely mechanics, or is it nature we're dealing with? What else than nature are the elementals of space and time? You are trained in the system. You go in a straight line. Competent. Perhaps innovative, in a minimalist way. But what I do is not the end of the process, it is the beginning. So, do I go back to the Fearless, which I left with a more efficient warp-drive system than I found? Or do you cast off your ignorance and let me continue? Could this damage our system? It's meaningless. Should we let him try? ""Let him try""? Don't talk about me as if I'm not standing right here! We might as well let him try. You are too generous. Boy! Don't play with that! Engineering is ready to proceed. Engineering, this is the bridge. It's your call. Do this one just like the last time. Nothing changes. Commander, I'll make my preliminary adjustments at warp 1.5, and complete them as we achieve warp four. Engineering to bridge. Did you copy that? Affirmative, Number One. Are you ready? We are. La Forge, set in warp 1.5. Warp 1.5, sir. Engage. Alright, here we go. What are you doing? Captain, we're passing warp ten! What is our velocity? It's off the scale, sir. Reverse engines. Captain, no one has ever reversed engines at this velocity. No one has gone this fast. Reverse engines. All stop. Reading all stop, sir. Position? Calculating it. Data, what do you read over there? Malfunction... I trust. Position, Mr. La Forge? We've not only left our own galaxy, but passed through two others, ending up on the far side of Triangulum. The galaxy known as M33. That's not possible. Data, what distance have we traveled? 2,700,000 light years, sir. I can't accept that! You must, sir. Our comparisons show it to be accurate. And I calculate that at maximum warp it would take over... ...300 years to get home! Captain's log, stardate 41263.2. This will be a rather unusual log entry, assuming Starfleet ever receives it. As I've already informed my crew, a surge of power during a warp-speed experiment has sent our starship hurtling out of our galaxy and past another, taking us over 2,700,000 light years in a few minutes. Message on this has been transmitted to Starfleet, sir. Which they should receive in 51 years, ten months, nine weeks... Mr. Data! Sir? Capt Picard, I presume. We don't know what happened. The truth is, I made a wonderful, incredible mistake. Just explain what brought us here. As the power grew, I applied the energy asymptomatically. I anticipated some tilling. That was my error, using the Bessel functions at the beginning. What is he saying, Number One? It sounds like nonsense. But considering... Considering where we are... ...we must assume it isn't. Can I do something to help? I can call my mother. She's a doctor. There's nothing she can do. I need to rest. I've been away too long. Is what happened to you part of what happened to the ship? Please believe me. I mean no harm to this vessel or those in it. Is Mr. Kosinski like he sounds? A joke? No, it's too cruel. He has sensed some small part of this. That space and time and thought aren't the separate things they appear to be? I thought the formula you were using said something like that. Don't ever say that again! Not at your age, in a world that's not ready for such... ...such dangerous nonsense. I suspected that this rate of speed was possible, but at this level... No, never. We're going to need new definitions, new parameters. Perhaps you could call it the Kosinski Scale. Why not? Yes, of course! Since I'm the one who's made the warp barrier meaningless. Captain, this must be a special thrill for you. Thrill? As an explorer. In three centuries, we've charted just 11 percent of our galaxy. And then, we accomplished this. Yes, but isn't the real point, can you do it again? Can you get us home? Well, of course I can. I'll just do what I did before. Coming, Riker? Cmdr Riker will join you in a moment. Comment is invited. Counselor? He's convinced he's right. I have no doubt of that. Can you allow a man who's made one mistake into a position where he may make another? Captain, if this guy can't get us back, who will? Captain, why not avail ourselves of this opportunity for study? There's a giant protostar in the process of forming. No other vessel has been out this far. Spoken like a true Starfleet graduate. It is tempting, Number One? Aye, sir, it is. But, as they say, you're the Captain. If Kosinski can get us home, Starfleet can use his technique to bring back a pure science vessel. Do even more. Tell Kosinski to get us out of here. Aye, sir. Do you realize how many great advancements of mankind have been tied to speed? This is a moment in history, right here, right now, and your names will be forever linked with mine. Excuse me, Cmdr Riker. I don't think he did this. It was... Not now. Standing by. But, sir, I was watching his assistant... I'm sure this is fascinating, Wesley, but not right now! Aye, sir. Come on. He's too tired. Why don't you do it by yourself? Yes, why not? No! I will help. As you wish. I've laid in the reciprocal course back, Captain. Tell the Captain I am ready, First Officer. Ready for you to engage, Captain. As before, begin at warp 1.5. Warp 1.5, sir. This isn't working. All stop. Answering all stop, Captain. According to the instruments, our speed never exceeded warp 1.5. All stopped, sir. Yes. But where is this place? Where none have gone before. Captain's log, stardate 41263.3. Instead of returning to our own galaxy, the Enterprise has gone forward to a place in the universe which is uncharted and unknown. Our position puts us at over a billion light years from our galaxy. Data, you have the helm. I'll be in Engineering. What is it? A Klingon targ! My pet! From home! But, when I was a child... You're saying it's a kitty-cat? Yes, I suppose you could call it that. You darling! What are you doing here? Now, run. This place isn't safe at all. Tasha, what's wrong? You look scared to death! I was... This is crazy. I was at the colony where I grew up, being chased by a rape gang! Are you alright? Well, you're safe now. Captain! We need your help! What's wrong? Don't you see what's following us? Ensign, what are you doing? You look tense, Jean-Luc. Come and have a cup of tea. Maman... ? I make it good and strong, the way you like it. We'll have a nice long talk. This can't be! You've been... Dead? But I'm always with you. You know that. Yes... I felt that. But why now, suddenly? You mean out here? At what you say is the end of the universe? Or did you see this as the beginning of it? We believe it the outer rim. Maman, do you understand these things? Can you tell me where my ship is? What is this place? Captain? You were reported headed for... Just a moment, Number One! Can I help you, sir? No. No, let's help all of us. General quarters. Red alert. What is it? Why are we at general quarters? It was the quickest way to get everyone's attention. This is the Captain. This is not a drill. It seems that in this place, the world of the physical universe and the world of ideas is somehow intermixed. What we think also becomes a reality. We must, therefore, I repeat, must begin controlling our thoughts. We will give you more on this as our understanding increases. The Enterprise will stay at full alert until the crisis is over. What did you do? It was his assistant. Kosinski wasn't controlling the experiments. It was me! The equations he punched in were nonsense. As we thought. I honestly thought... it was me. I thought somehow... ...somehow I was operating on his level. It was also my fault. I should have realized it wasn't Kosinski. How could you? How could any of us? Wesley did. If you knew, why didn't you say? He tried, twice. I didn't listen. He's unconscious. Why? I'm not certain yet. He phased, sir. What does that mean? Parts of him disappeared then came back. Nobody paid attention to him the first time. This time, he was fighting it. He's dying. He mustn't! He's the only one who can get us back. Realistically, that doesn't seem possible. Captain's log, supplemental. Our position is unknown. Our only chance of returning to the known universe is a dying alien, who is generally humanoid, but with a physiology which would create medical problems in caring for him. Cause? I don't know. My equipment doesn't register his life signs. I would guess exhaustion, fatigue. Will he be alright? Why is the boy here? Mom, he's my friend. You may want him here, sir. He seems to have developed an attachment to the boy. My name is Wesley. He knows! We all know. Will he live? I'm not sure. Wake him. I'd rather let him come round. We don't have that luxury! He could die, and with him any chance we have. Doctor... Wes... We all have other friends on this ship. If we stay here, we may lose the ability to distinguish between thought and reality. Regardless of the risk, wake him, now! Recognize me? I'm the Captain and I need answers. I will do my best... to provide... Who are you, or what? I am... a Traveler. Traveler? What is your destination? Destination? Yes. What place are you trying to reach? Place? No. There's no specific place I wish to go. What is the purpose of your journey? Curiosity. That's not an answer. I have certain abilities. They give me a knowledge of propulsion. I have been trading this for passage on Starfleet vessels. Letting Kosinski take the credit? It seemed the sensible way. Until now. Captain... I seek only transportation in order to see and experience your reality. I am no threat to you, your ship or your crew. He isn't, Captain! I know he isn't! Our reality? And in order to satisfy this curiosity, you have brought my ship and my crew into grave risk! I have made some mistakes. Some mistakes! What mistakes could possibly explain these explosions of velocity? I don't know if I can put this in terms you'll understand. I believe there may be a warp speed that can get us beyond galaxy M33. But there is no velocity of any magnitude that can possibly bring us... wherever this is. Are our navigational sensors right? Are we millions of light years from where we were? Well, yes. Well, what got us here? Thought. Thought? You do understand? Thought is the basis of all reality. The energy of thought, to put it in your terms, is very powerful. That's not an explanation. I have the ability to act like a lens, which focuses thought. That's just nonsense. You're asking us to believe in magic! Well, yes, this could seem like magic to you. No. No, it actually makes sense to me. Only the power of thought could explain what has been happening. Thought is the essence of where you are now. You do understand the danger? Chaos! What we think is what happens. It pains me I was so careless, Captain. My intent was only to observe, not to cause this. You should not be here until your far distant future. Certainly not until you've learned control. You are from a different time? Not exactly from another time. I... Although as you understand the concept, yes, perhaps that term fits as well as any. You have this ability to travel? Yes. Others of your kind have it? Oh, yes. Then why is there no record of someone like you having visited us? What wonderful arrogance! It's because we have not visited you before. Why not? Well, because, up until now, if you'll forgive this, you've been... uninteresting. It's only now that your life form merits serious attention. I'm... sorry... What's happening? He's unconscious again. Revive him. Whatever you need from him, get it soon! Sir, our first leap out of our galaxy was, as he said, a mistake. Unless he was distracted. and it weakened him, resulting in the incredible leap out here. Theory! Have you any facts that fit this? Can you get us back? Captain, not so fast. We have an opportunity for scientific discovery. And we report our observations how? To whom? Can you get us back? I will try. Take him down to Engineering. I'll be on the bridge. No! He's very weak. The Captain's right. We must hurry. First, I request a moment with the Captain. Alone. Strange how he seems to care for you. He will forget me in time, which is as it should be. It's Wesley I want to speak about. The boy? It's best you do not repeat this, especially not to the mother. Whatever happens, it is imperative that it proceed naturally. I must get my ship back. Do we have time for this? Oh, yes! He and a few like him are why I travel. You have it in your power to encourage him without interfering. Encourage him in what? How shall I explain? Are you familiar with the intricacies of what is called ""music""? Somewhat. Such musical geniuses I saw in your ship's libraries. One called Mozart, who as a small child, wrote astonishing symphonies. A genius who made music not only to be heard, but seen and felt beyond the understanding, the ability of others. Wesley is such a person. Not with music, but with the equally lovely intricacies of time, energy, propulsion. And the instruments of this vessel, which allow all that to be played. You're right, I must hurry now. But you're right. He is just a boy. He should be encouraged, but told none of this. We're going home. Take him to Engineering. Yes, sir. I'll be on the bridge. Put it out! How? Think! Put the flame out in your thoughts. Get to your station. Concentrate on your assignment! Yes, sir! Captain's log. Any time entry is meaningless. We have to repeat the same warp experiment but with one variation. A principal part of this formula will be the thoughts of everyone on the Enterprise. We have no idea how this works. We understand only that the Traveler makes use of this somehow. It is important that those aboard avoid random thoughts that might change the reality of what we're attempting to do. Do you have further advice? When you begin the attempt, there will be stress. It's only natural the crew's concentration will shift. Plus some genuine fear, Captain. You can't notice what's happening without that. All decks, all stations. This is the Captain speaking. I must have your full attention. In a few moments, as we attempt to warp home, it is absolutely vital that you centre your thoughts on your duty or on the welfare of the one called the Traveler. Think of giving him some of your strength. This is an order. You must try to do this. Now, attempt to concentrate completely on your duty of the moment. Or on the Traveler, on his wellbeing. Think of him as someone you care deeply for. All decks, all stations... battle stations! I need Kosinski back on the main computer. You need me? Yes. Helm, set in warp 1.5, retroactive course. Warp 1.5. Retroactive 261, mark 31, sir. Bridge to Engineering. Stand by. I feel an abundance of wellbeing on the ship. It feels like... ...quite wonderful. Engineering to bridge. We're ready. On my order, Mr. Data, Mr. La Forge. Engage. It's not happening. It's not enough. Warp 1.5, sir, which is what my instruments read all along. Our position is exactly what it was before this sleigh ride began, sir. Cease red alert. Sleigh ride? Whatever you want to call it. I don't have a proper name for it. The Travelers gone, sir. Gone? He's phased completely out of existence. At least, out of our existence. Attention, all decks. With your support, the Traveler has returned us to our own galaxy. However, he has now left us. Wherever he has gone, we wish him well. Have the boy sent to the bridge. Wesley Crusher, report to the bridge, on the double. Our next assignment is on this heading? Yes, sir. Mr. Data, Mr. La Forge, increase to warp five, same heading. Warp five, sir. Same heading, sir. Wesley, come on the bridge. Move! Cmdr Riker told me how supportive you were. Well done. At ease. Er... Sit here. Captain, it's not allowed. Your orders. That's true. Well, I can't waive them again... Only commissioned officers... It's alright. I understand. Please don't interrupt me. I'm sorry, sir. Any commission rank? Even ensign? That would give him authorized access to the bridge. Well, then, I'll have to make him an acting ensign. Captain's log, stardate 41263.4. For outstanding performance in the best Starfleet tradition, Wesley is made Acting Ensign with the duties and privileges of that rank. And whether that rank becomes permanent depends on you. At the earliest opportunity, your application for Starfleet Academy will be tendered. Until then, you will learn this ship. Every operation and function. Commander, a duty schedule for Mr. Crusher, heavy on study. Aye, sir. Meanwhile, sit here and learn something. Sir, shall I send for Dr Crusher? Why? Is someone ill? Or would you rather tell her, Wes? Sir, I'd like to sit here for a while. I'll tell her later. "
S1E07,"Captain's log, stardate 41249.3. We have orbited the two major planets of the Beta Renner system, taking aboard delegates from those worlds. Since conquering space, their major life forms, the Anticans and the Selay, have become enemies. But both have applied for admission into our Federation. We are to deliver these delegates to a neutral conference planet, called Parliament, in the hope their dispute can be resolved. I'm Capt Picard. Welcome aboard. We hope your journey will be pleasant and comfortable. Arranging that will be Cmdr Riker. Welcome aboard. I'll show you the accommodations... We can already smell the Anticans. They were taken aboard first? Only because their world was first on this heading to Parliament. Will our quarters be near the Anticans? About 100 meters apart. Is that alright? No. Unsatisfactory. We can accommodate your wishes. We'll rearrange the assignments. Follow me. And we must be upwind from the Anticans. Of course, sir. Neither seem promising Federation candidates, sir. Even Parliament's peacemakers may find this case difficult. But do you understand this nonsense between them? No, sir. I never understood such hostility in Earth's history. Really? These life forms feel such passionate hatreds over matters of custom, god concepts, even, strangely enough, economic systems. Sir, my sensors are picking up an unusual energy object. On screen. Confirmed, sir. My sensors read nothing solid, but a lot of energy and changing patterns. Also traveling at warp speed, sir. Intriguing. I can find no match with anything in our records. Change course to make a close sensor pass. Then increase speed to reach Parliament on schedule. Aye, sir. Worf, why the interest in this? It's just routine maintenance on the sensor. Simple, Geordi. Our Captain wants his junior officers to learn, learn, learn. Not just his junior ones. Hold this relay off line, while I adjust the circuits. Security to sensor maintenance. La Forge here. We're making a close-sensor pass on an unusual object. Any problems? Not at all. All equipment on line and functioning. Sensors ready, sir. Life-form reading? No life-form readings, sir. Begin the pass. Sir, it is changing shape. Any readings of matter there? Negative, sir. Energy only. Sickbay, we have a medical emergency. I repeat, this is a medical emergency. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. What happened? He got hit by sensor feedback, maybe. Get back! You got it, Doc? I got it. Lt Worf, can you hear what I'm saying? Let's get him up. OK. Come on, big guy. On your feet. Here we go. That's it. Are you OK? He was monitoring the sensor console when he jerked, as though something hit him. What my sensors showed was... ...was a glow, just for a second. I can't explain it. Could your visor have malfunctioned? I doubt it, sir. It seemed like what I saw was something real. Sorry to call you, sir. Not strictly Security. It's about the dietary requirements of the Antican delegates. I thought that had been taken care of. So did we, sir. Live animals were beamed aboard. We were going to preserve the meat. But they say to bring it to them alive. Then do so. Lt Yar was... confused. We no longer enslave animals for food. But we have seen humans eat meat. You saw something as tasty as meat, but inorganically materialized out of patterns used by our transporters. This is sickening. It's barbaric. He's reading normal. How did you manage that? Yes. Normal. Are you alright? Yes, perfectly. Both of us. Quite normal now. What...?! Where am I? Don't you remember? You were in the sensor maintenance room. I remember monitoring the sensor console. What am I doing here? That's a story the Doctor will tell you. You feel it's something we should look at more carefully. A mystery is only a mystery as long as it remains uninvestigated. I love a mystery. But this one must wait till we deliver the delegates to Parliament. Time and tide, Lt La Forge. Go to warp eight. Warp eight, sir. Hi, Mom. You're back early. Yes. Physical sciences class. We're studying Dr Channing's theory on dilithium crystals. Tell me about it. Really? You never seemed interested in warp theory before. Dr Channing thinks it's possible to force dilithium into even more useful crystals, if, as shown here, matter and antimatter could be aligned efficiently. Would that affect navigation? This is engineering, not helm control. Oh, yes. The helm's located on the bridge. Mom? Is something wrong? This is the helm. Unless there's been some changes I don't know about. Lt Worf is much improved, ready to return to duty. What was the diagnosis? A temporary mental aberration. Doctor? When such a diagnosis concerns a bridge officer, I expect a better explanation. Then I will have to run crosschecks on the library computer. Klingons are so unusual in their reactions, aren't they? Use science station two, Doctor. Intriguing, Doctor. What does helm control have to do with medical crosschecks? Why am I...? Is something wrong, Doctor? Are you alright? Yes. I'll do my work in my office. That's where I should be. Do you want someone to accompany you? Captain, there is a malfunction in this station. I cannot bring any information up on it. Science two does not function either, sir. Engineering to Capt Picard. Something's wrong with warp-drive circuitry. Transporter room six to bridge. Transporter console malfunction, sir. Data, this ship is less than a year out of space dock. What are the chances of this occurring? It is a virtual impossibility, sir. So, what the hell is going on here? And there are no explanations for these malfunctions? All the department heads have reported the damage repaired. That was not my question. What caused the malfunctions? I believe it was a rampant electronic short that jumped from system to system. But the only thing is... Yes, Mr. Singh? That shouldn't be possible. The affected systems don't interact with each other. And where they do, it wasn't an interlink that was malfunctioning. Have you spoken with Chief Engineer Argyle about this? With all Engineering staff, sir. They're just as puzzled. I'm not satisfied. I want an explanation by the time we reach Parliament. But, sir... By the time we reach Parliament, Mr. Singh. These weapons were taken from two of your people. They were loitering near the Selay delegation's quarters. Care to explain, sir? These are not weapons. They are tools. We use these to dispatch the animals we consume. Your food is not on the same deck as the Selay delegation. And these could kill. I admit some of my people are impulsive. And we all have reason to hate the Selay. They appear to have the same feelings about you, sir. The nature of politics. You're on notice that all your weapons, no matter what their function, are being confiscated. Violence will not be tolerated on the Enterprise. Of course not. And if any occurs, I assure you, it will not be we Anticans who start it. Thank you, sir. But... we will finish it! Sir, warp power is fading. Picard to Engineering. What is the problem? We have lost the warp-engine computer tie. Warp five, four, three, two. State-of-the-art vessel? Data, signal Parliament we'll be delayed. We will send a new arrival time as soon as it is determined. Sir, subspace radio is out. Alright, gentlemen, your theories on this sudden vulnerability in our systems. If the Enterprise were so fragile, she never would've left space dock. Her systems' failures are not endemic to the ship but are the result of the actions of an adversary. We have a saboteur aboard. I believe I said that. Gentlemen, the question is, who? It can't be one of our own people. Agreed. It must be someone from either alien delegation. If the Ferengi bribed even one of them, that's all they'd need. Ferengi contacts have been detected on both Selay and Antica, sir. Can either of you suggest any other suspects? You're sounding like a private eye. Inquiry. Private eye? A private consulting investigator, Data, who solves crimes. Most interesting occupation. In the world of fact, probably not. However, in literature, criminal detection can be a fascinating exercise. Sherlock Holmes would have an interesting view of our mystery. But I'm afraid we'll have to find our solution without history's greatest consulting detective. How about here, Mr. Singh? If the control network breaks off here... It leads warp-engine commands off into dead ends. Excellent. I can handle it from here, Mr. Crusher. But, sir... You are scheduled for classwork now. Sorry. Yes, sir. But I don't learn nearly this much in school. I tend to agree, but the Captain's orders on this are very clear. Hi. Solve any new problems today? I was starting to, maybe. Mr. Singh sent me off to class. You're only an acting ensign. You gotta let commissioned officers do some of the work. Mom, I've learned a lot more than they understand. For example, the dilithium-crystals theory I was telling you about? When were you telling me about that? This morning. Don't you remember? Honestly, I don't remember. Engineering to Capt Picard. Security alert. I just found Mr. Singh. He's dead. Captain's log, stardate 41249.4. I've ordered an immediate investigation into the death of Assistant Chief Engineer Singh. We continue to run on impulse power. He could've been working there, restoring warp power. According to these readings, we could go back to warp speed now. Those aren't the same readings as when I left. Singh probably repaired it just before he was killed. He couldn't have. The problems were inside the engines. Who else could have corrected it? Inform the bridge of engine status. Engineering to bridge. We now have warp capacity, sir. All power on line. Well done. Warp engines ready on previous heading. Warp factor six. I tolerate these questions, Lt Yar, because I need this vessel to get us to Parliament. Your shipboard problems do not concern me. They should. Our delays are your delays. The peace conference will wait for us. I must ask where you were during this vessel's Earth hours of 18:00 last night and 07:00 this morning. Eating. Sir, we're talking about hours here. It was a large meal, Lt Yar. And a very interesting animal. You wanted me, Doctor? Yes, concerning your memory block-out. I still don't remember having one. The same thing happened to me. I want to try hypnosis on both of you. It may restore your memory as to what happened. One thing is clear. Almost all of the peace delegates answered our questions with lies. Imprecise, Lieutenant. They omitted certain truths, which, in itself, tells us something. We can learn something from nondisclosure? Indubitably, my good woman. It's something the Captain mentioned. Sherlock Holmes. Indubitably, Data has been studying him. Has studied, sir. Every case. As Holmes would've pointed out, during the time in question, something was afoot. Afoot? While both sets of delegates say they were in their quarters, our crew locator sensed them passing here and here. It doesn't show where they went. We're still in the dark. On the contrary, my dear colleague. On their return, they drew medical supplies, appropriate to the treatment of minor wounds on these life forms. Which leaves one conclusion. Exactly! They were too engaged in their affairs to disable the ship and murder the engineer. Given the choice, they would rather kill each other than any of us. It's elementary, my dear Riker. Sir. Beverly, can you hear me? I want you to go back in your mind to the moment when you first recall the sensation of memory loss. Picture it exactly as it occurred. He's lying on the hospital bed, sedated. I'm walking up to him. How do you feel as you lean over to take the specimen? I... feel someone... else. There's someone else who's there. Not... alone. Get out. Get out of my mind! That's almost exactly what you said. As though there were something else inside you. It confirms the feeling of duality I sensed earlier in both of them. Why didn't you report it? Because, sir, I assumed at first it was the kind of duality that we Betazoids feel in all of you. Even you, sir. When you approach a decision and ask yourself which direction to go, who are you talking to? Your hypnotism revealed another form of duality. Yes, sir. I believe something invaded them. It seems the only possible conclusion. Let's proceed without the pipe. Yes, sir. If you wish, sir. But I ask if you'd take it as incontrovertible that it cannot be a family member, or one of the crew. Yes. Very unlikely. Then our investigation was worthwhile. We've eliminated the delegates and the ship's complement. What are you suggesting? I'm referring to the great detective's credo, sir. I quote, ""We must fall back on the old axiom that when other contingencies fail, whatever remains, however improbable... ...must be the truth."" That engine computer net wasn't repaired, sir. It just suddenly became alright. Sometimes, it's the result that counts. What the...? Oh, no! What is it? Helm control's down. No response. Bridge to Captain. You're needed immediately. Wes, alert Engineering from your panel, alright? I'm trying. Report. Helm is down, sir. There's no apparent reason. Captain, we've just dropped to impulse power. Sir, are you alright? I thought I just saw... I'm fine. Everything is fine now. Why the drop to impulse power, Lieutenant? The helm is malfunctioning. Malfunctioning? You're wrong. Look again. Captain, I was ju... Mr. La Forge? There's nothing wrong now, sir. Everything is as it should be. In that case, make our heading... 925, mark three... seven. Sir? You have a problem with that heading? You wanna double back on our course? Isn't that what I ordered? Yes, sir. Sir? I'm puzzled by your reversing our course. That energy cloud. I believe it important we have another look at it. We're behind schedule for Parliament. A very important scientific discovery awaits us on this heading. Perhaps you'd like to share your reasoning on that. Yes. Since we obtained minimal information on our sensor pass. Right, Data. We must go back to learn more. Counselor, do you believe a ship captain should explain every order? Of course not, sir. I demand to see the Captain! Stop! Return to your quarters! What is that doing on our deck? I demand to know why this starship has changed its course. Please, return to your quarters, delegates. A mere change of direction hardly justifies mutiny. Exactly what do you believe you're sensing from him? It's just the feeling that... Well, that he's closed part of his mind to me. I just feel that the Captain has become... ...perhaps dangerous. If he's dangerous... If... He'd have to be relieved of command. Which you could do, but it's trouble if you're wrong. And it is all pure speculation. He has done nothing to subject the Enterprise to danger. I'd need a medical log, citing clear evidence of incapacity. You could do it without that problem. Only if all command officers agreed it was vital to do so. But he has not shown any overt unusual behavior. Ultimately, I believe he will. As second-in-command, it's still in your corner. I'll order medical and psychiatric exams. You'll have to back me up somehow. First Officer's log, supplemental. After meeting with senior officers, Dr Crusher and I will approach the Captain regarding his recent behavior. Yes? I'd like you to come to sickbay for some examinations, Captain. I'll be glad to when I'm free. I'd like to conduct them now, sir. Why? What can I do for you, Number One? Sir, Troi has recommended the examinations. Same question. Why? It is my duty to inform the Captain we believe he may be under some alien influence which may constitute a danger to this ship. I consider it equally possible that the two of you, and Counselor Troi, are overworked, and possibly suffering hallucinations. This is an order. You will arrange medical and psychiatric exams both for yourself and them. Doctor, are you aware that everyone is behaving strangely? I'm concerned that you've changed the ship's course. What's happened to your mind? The search for knowledge is always our primary mission. I'm sorry, I... I really am too busy for this kind of nonsense. Do I have to call Security to force you to report to sickbay? No, sir. What the hell... ! Sorry. Wrong species. Riker to Security Chief. Yar here. Security guard to Engineering deck. Selays are playing hide-and-seek with the Anticans. I want them returned to quarters under guard. Right away, sir. Come. What do you want? Here are the results from the exams you ordered, sir. You don't care to inspect them? Please... are you Jean-Luc? He is here. The Jean-Luc I know? And more. The ""more"" frightens me. And elates us. We wish you could understand the glorious adventure ahead. You and...? Soon we'll both be home. First Officer's log, supplemental. On the orders of Capt Picard, we have returned to the energy-pattern cloud. I am convinced that something from this cloud now shares the Captain's mind. But there seems to be nothing we can do within regulations. We're approaching the cloud, sir. Very well, Mr. La Forge. Bring us to within 10,000km and hold us there. Aye, sir. Shall we begin the scientific tests? They're already under way. I have an announcement for the entire bridge. As many of you suspected, when our ship passed through the edge of... this, it accidentally carried away a sentient being. Much like these energy patterns we're seeing here. Terrifying for any intelligent being. As if a great claw had scooped one of you from your homeworld. Drawn into the energy circuits, it found you, Worf. Frantic at being taken from its homeworld, and recognizing you as sentient, it pleaded for help, but in ways you couldn't understand. Desperately going from person to person, and then discovering the computer intelligence in this ship's memory circuits. Simplistic intelligence, but it furnished it enough to slow this... Enterprise thing that had captured it. And it very much regrets the accidental death of Engineer Singh. Captain... ...do you exist in combination with this entity? Is it in control of you, sir? Soon after we combined, we learned much about each other. A passion for the unknown. We found we had similar dreams. It offered your Captain a way to realize them beyond human expectations. Captain, I must speak to you privately now. I understand. As an energy pattern, free of the limitations of matter, he might travel anywhere at any velocity. Captain, do you hear me? Sir, I see no way for you to journey with an energy form. Isn't there? He's planning to beam himself and the entity into that cloud. The transporter need not pattern your Captain into matter. We'll beam energy only. We will become a combined energy pattern of our life forms. A resignation from Starfleet has been recorded. I refuse to allow this, sir. How does this resignation threaten the ship or crew? You are relieved of duty! I judge you to be disabled and mentally incapacitated. Security! Red alert! Restrain the Captain! Where is he? This is blinding me! Captain! I'll help you if you'll let me! Someone restrain the Captain! First Officer's log, supplemental. More than an hour has passed since the Captain beamed out, energy only. Every effort has been made to determine his whereabouts. We have no idea what the coordinates were. He's just floating around? How can we settle for that? Give me a choice then. Still no readings. No sign of anything. Mr. La Forge... ...it's time to set a course for Parliament. Warp eight. We're really leaving him? Commander? Wait! It's the Captain. But only the Captain. He's out there alone. The entity... Has it abandoned him? No. But the combination wasn't possible out there. He's in trouble. We have to beam him back. As what? He's nothing but energy now. Sir, the entity was caught in the ship's circuitry. The Captain might try to get in the same way. Bring us in closer, La Forge. Moving in, sir, but where? There's no way to know. Let's hope he can come part way himself. Troi, is there any way you can get a message to him? I wish I could. Sensors monitoring the perimeter... ...ship's circuitry, sir. Nothing. Bring us into the edge of it. Aye, sir. Sir? On my sensor controls. There's something here. I feel it. Just as before, going to Worf first. Something crazy on my panel. Commander Riker... Static? P for Picard? He's in the ship's circuitry. Come to the transporter room, please. There might be a way, sir. Hurry! Is it a wild theory, Data? We have the Captain's physical pattern. He was the last to beam out. Is what you're thinking possible? Unknown. I hope the Captain remembers his pattern is here. If he has, his energy will be in the transporter relays now. I wish we had some sign that he was here. I guess we've no choice but to risk it. Energizing, sir. What the devil am I doing here? Sounds like our Captain. But confused. This Picard pattern was formed before he went out there. What's happening to me, Number One? I was preparing to... beam out... to somewhere. I remember there was talk of an entity? But it all seems so vague. I believe the Captain is now his separate self, sir. Much of what happened is missing. What are you talking about? Is this still Sherlock Holmes? Indubitably, sir. At least you got rid of the damn pipe. Dr Crusher has asked me to steer you past sickbay. She said you've been looking tired. Captain! Yes, Lieutenant? Sorry, but Security Team Two reports they discovered blood outside the Selay quarters... Lieutenant! This couldn't have waited a moment? It's good to see you, sir. The problem is, a cook has been asked to broil a reptile for the Anticans, and it looks like the Selay delegate. Riker, what with the peace delegates and all, I think I do need a rest. Take charge, Number One. "
S1E08,"Captain's log, stardate 41255.6. After delivering Earth colonists to the Strnab solar system, we have discovered another Class-M planet in the Rubicun star system. We are now in orbit there. It is inhabited and unusually lovely. An away team has gone down to make contact. They are returning to the ship. Riker says the planet's life forms are almost identical to us. He's enthusiastic. Captain? Sorry, Troi. The Doctor has something important to tell you. You've talked about it for days. Shore leave for the crew. Establishing this colony has been exhausting for the crew. We're not a supply vessel. Settling all those people has been a strain. I'm tired myself. Is it as good as your report suggests? As per report. Class-M, Earth-like, beautiful. It will startle you. Sounds wonderful for the children. The holodecks are marvelous, but there's nothing like open spaces and fresh air. I've listed my report on their customs and laws. Simple, common-sense things. They're wild, but also puritanical. They're neat as pins, ultra lawful, and make love at the drop of a hat. Any hat. But the happiest report has its negatives. Let's have them. There are none that we could find. But there is a problem here. That faulty reading, sir. I'm reading something off the starboard bow, but there is nothing there. Sensor technicians are working on it, sir. A glitch in the system. I take it you find no glitch at all in this planet, however? No, sir. If you approve shore leave, we could start with a small group. Of course. Wesley? lf we go down, I'd like you to join the away team to evaluate this planet as a place for young people to relax. Yes, sir. If our scans and observations confirm the report, of course I'll approve it. Let's just hope it's not too good to be true. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, supplemental. We are in orbit of Rubicun III, the home of a life form who call themselves the Edo. Our away team, including Wesley Crusher, has beamed down to make arrangements concerning some well-earned recreation. Careful, sir. It's alright. Those are the Edo we met before. They certainly are fit. They certainly are. Health and happiness. A pleasant day to you. You did return, as promised. Rivan, Liator. Also from our vessel, Troi and... Slowly, slowly. I must welcome this lovely one. Nice to see you again. My pleasure. Counselor? Healthy sensuality, sir. I feel friendship and... happiness. And I welcome this huge one. Oh, yes... Nice planet. Yeah. But you are a young one. I do not know your love customs. I guess... ...whatever you usually do. Others would like to visit. Is there a limit on numbers? Whatever pleases you. We'll discuss it at the Council Chambers. Shall we go there now, or remain in play? Play? At love. Unless you don't enjoy that. Perhaps you do. And you... Yes, I can see that you do. Maybe I should just go on ahead. This is unfair to him. We'll go to the Council Chambers. There are people your age there. Well, I can't make any promises. You don't have to. Our rules are simple. No one does anything uncomfortable to them. Come! Our people will want to know you. Rivan, perhaps they can't run. Can't run? Of course we can run. Right, Commander? That's the custom here, running. Lead the way. When in Rome... When in where, sir? Good health to you. Happiness to you. It's like an Eden here. Good health. I thought you'd be out of breath. We may surprise you. Children, meet your new friend. Well, hello! Join us. Yes, please. Come on. This way. And now you must meet some new friends. Everyone! We've brought the visitors. Please. Enjoy what we have. I've traced it through our sensor channel, sir. It is not a glitch. It's confirmed by my readings. It's a... shadow something. Exactly. As if it were neither in or out of our dimension. What is, Commander? Whatever is evading our alarm, sir. Centre main viewer on that area. I see nothing, Commander. Enterprise to object off our starboard bow. Identify yourself. Shields and deflectors up full, sir. Main phaser banks ready. Any reply? It was unintelligible. Running it through language circuits. Geordi, have a real look. Aye, sir. Sir, my sensors read it. It's half there. It looks as if it were partly transparent. Data, what the hell is it? Lt La Forge to Captain. Go ahead. What can you make out? I've never seen this before, sir. After a spectral analysis, it's... as if it's not really there. I don't understand it. I've got its first transmission, sir. It translates as... ...""stand by."" Sir, something's coming out of that ship. Verified, sir. It's very small. What is it?! Intruder alert, sir. No location. The away team! We've lost contact with our people. The relays do show something. Why is everything a ""something""? State... the... purpose. State the purpose of what you have done. I'm Capt Picard... commanding this Federation starship. State the purpose of your visit here. We have sent down our away team to make peaceful contact here. Do you plan to leave life forms here? No. We are merely visiting here. But you did more at the world you just left. Why have you left your own life forms there? The colony we just planted, sir. That world was uninhabited. The life forms we left there had... had sought the challenge... At least, that is the basic reason. ...had sought the challenge of creating a new lifestyle, a new society there. Life on our world is driven to protect itself by seeding itself as widely as possible. Do not interfere with my children below. Captain, I do not understand how, but it is asking me if I was constructed for information exchange. If there is any way of finding out whatever it is out there, Data... Watch. I bet you can't do this. Watch this. I want to do something, too. With you. What? It's something you can teach me. Will you? Well... Actually, there are some games I don't quite know yet. It's playing ball. Will you teach me? Sure! lf you have a bat, I can show you my favorite. A bat? A stick or a branch. Erm... about this long, this thick. In the gardens. Come on. This will please you. Join us. Thanks. Another time. Joy and happiness. It certainly is. The good life, Worf. I am not concerned with pleasure. I am a warrior. Even Klingons need love. For love, sir, I would need a Klingon woman. What about plain old basic sex? No need for that? Of course. But with the females available to me, Earth females, I must restrain myself too much. They are quite fragile, sir. Worf, if anyone else said that, I'd suspect he was bragging. Bragging, sir? I'll pass on that. I'd better check in. Enterprise, come in. Captain, do you read me? Let's... This may be nothing, but let's move our people together. Including Wesley, the boy? He's outside. Is there a problem? We've lost contact with our ship. It's nothing these people have done. I'm certain. Their minds are open. Help me locate Wes. He's wandered off. That is extraordinary. One moment, Lieutenant? Yes, but you've got to hear this. You're saying there's no crime here? No one breaks any laws? Once, long, long ago, there was much disorder. But not now. But I see no sign of police. Those who enforce laws? We have very few. Mediators. They are needed only in one place each day. The punishment zone. A selected area. A completely random selection? Only our mediators know where or for how long. We're proud of the wisdom of our ancestors. No one knows where or when a zone will be. And so no one risks death. Death? By breaking any law. Explain this. Only one punishment for any crime. Anyone who commits any crime in the punishment zone dies? The law is the law. Our peace is built on that. Even for ignoring a rule like ""keep off the grass""? Then no one breaks that rule. Who would risk execution? A white wall or fence reminds anyone of a forbidden area. And just who tells visitors about these rules? We'd better find Wesley. Here! Alright! Over here! Yeah, go back. Alright! You're very clever at this. At home, we play a lot. Toss the ball ahead of me. No! It's forbidden to disturb plants. Couldn't you see the fence? Don't ever go past a white marker! It's OK. I'm fine. No! Please, no! Speak the truth. We are mediators. I said I was fine. He doesn't know. How very sad. This zone has been selected. But he doesn't understand. It's always sad. Now, doubly so. I was chasing a ball and I fell into that. I'm really sorry. You admit you did that, freely? I'm with Starfleet. We don't lie. It won't happen again. We apologize. We're sorry, too. But that changes nothing. Careful, they've got some strange laws here. You reviewed their laws. There was nothing about punishment. One moment. Is there a witness to this transgression? It was my fault. I threw the ball past him. We have a visible transgression, witnesses and an admission of guilt. Though it pains us deeply to do it, we must. Are you prepared for punishment? Punishment? If you mean what they told us about... What punishment? Death. Don't make it difficult. Drop it! Drop it now. It's a kind of syringe. What is this? Is this poison? Of course. Completely painless. The boy would have felt nothing. Now you've frightened him. He was going to kill me? And if this zone was still in effect, you would all die. They said you came as friends. Is this how friends act? Enterprise, from away team. Come in. Are you receiving us, Enterprise? Condition? No sign of consciousness. But the readings are normal for him. This must be some form of information exchange with whatever is out there. I hope it is. Any news from the away team? Something's blocking communication. Security. Urgent! Enterprise from away team. Lieutenant, we're receiving you. Urgent call for Capt Picard. We have serious trouble with... a member of the team and an unusual law they have here. Riker, stand by. Any signs of consciousness? No. It may be minutes or hours. It's unclear what's happened to him. Take him to sickbay. Anything new on that thing over there? Negative, sir. Captain to First Officer. I'm beaming down. Would you care to comment privately on how you read any of this? Unnecessary. These people are honest, almost to a fault. And they have great pride in their ways. You're the Captain. We're ready. This way, please. Welcome to our world, Captain. Thank you. We regret that our system of justice is troubling you. The boy, Wesley Crusher, where is he, please? I've allowed them to hold him pending the outcome of this. He is safe and unharmed. We promise that. Captain, I do not know how you Earth people conduct law and justice, even if you respect such things. We do. Good. So do we. Our precepts have been handed down from long ago. The tranquility you see has been made possible by our laws. We are a people of law. They sometimes bring us sadness, but we have adjusted to that. Perhaps your laws work as well. They haven't always. Now, they do. Do you execute criminals? No. Not any longer. But you did once. Unfortunately. But since then... But when you did, was it believed necessary to do so? Some people felt so. Now, we detect the seeds of criminal behavior. Capital punishment is no longer considered a justifiable deterrent. So, we are not yet as advanced as they are. And since you are advanced in other ways, I suggest you use your superior powers to rescue the Wesley boy. We will record him as a convicted criminal, an advanced person who luckily escaped the barbarism of this backward little world. Unfortunately, we have a law known as the Prime Directive. Riker has explained it. Is the boy in any danger from you at this moment? Until sundown? Because you are strangers, we are delaying enforcement of the law, but we must act by sundown. Then I have another question. While orbiting, while circling high above your world, as we do, we have encountered a strange object. A vessel, perhaps. Have you any idea what it is? It's not entirely real. At least, it's not... completely solid. Do you mean God? God? God is said to be somewhere up there, protecting us. Exactly... how would you describe God? As you just did. As existing both here, and in another place also. But when God wants to show its power, it can make itself felt most fully. Captain, come in, please. Picard here. CMO Crusher, sir. Cmdr Data has regained consciousness. What condition? Can he talk? He insists on it, sir. Urgently. Stand by. Picard out. I want to speak to her personally about her son. You promise that Wesley Crusher is safe until sundown? You have our word. Then, will one of you return with me to our ship? Of course. I'll go as a hostage for the boy's safety. No. I want you to identify something for me, if you can. Transporter room, three to beam up. I'm frightened. There's no reason to be. Transporter room, energize. But this is a city. A great city. Captain, what's this about Wesley? In a moment, Doctor. In a moment? Exactly! In a moment. You were about to say? With such power, why be concerned about our laws? You could take the boy from us. It's not that simple. From the starboard lounge, you can see whatever is outside this vessel. You mean my world? We're high above it. And something else circling your world. It's important to us, and perhaps to you, to know what it is. I'm sorry, but it was necessary. Do you know what that is? Can you tell us what it is? Is it God? It's very important that you answer something. How do you recognize what it is? Nothing will harm you. I promise. Just tell us how you recognize it. It has appeared before. Can you speak to it? Does it speak to you? Captain! Return my child. Return? It's coming towards us. Picard to transporter room, come in. Yes, but hurry! It's still coming towards us. Transporter Chief to Captain. One to beam down to away team location. Hurry! Engage! Urgent! Engage! It seems the Edo's god is very protective of its children. I had no choice but to learn about that thing from her. I'm sorry I had to. She was so frightened. It's understandable. Orbiting with God is no small experience. Let's go see your patient, Doctor. What do you intend to do about my son? He's being held safely until sundown. When he faces execution! He's committed no crime any sane and reasonable person... You saw what that thing was about to do. I apologize, sir. But this is very difficult for me. If he were your son you'd be as frightened... But I am. Data's in sickbay here. You'll find him able to talk to you. He's checking out fine. Thank you. Finish it later, please. I was an excellent choice. They were able to communicate quite... I was about to say easily, but there was nothing easy about it. They were about to overload my circuitry. You say ""they."" So it is a vessel of some sort? It's not a single entity, sir. They know the Edo worship them as a god. They know? They recognize it is expected at the Edo stage of evolution. What sort of vessel? It's perhaps not what we would call a vessel, sir. The dimensions it occupies allow them to be... in several places at once. They consider this entire star cluster is theirs. It was probably unwise of us to place a human colony in this area. Of course, there are 3,004 other planets we could colonize. The largest... Data, don't babble. Babble, sir? I'm not aware that I ever babble, sir. I sometimes have considerable information to communicate, and you may question the way I organize it... Please, organize it into brief answers to my questions. We have little time. Do they accept our presence at this planet? Undecided, sir. Data, please, feel free to volunteer any important information. I volunteer that they are now observing us, sir. To judge what we are like? No. It is more curiosity. I doubt that they expect us to abide by their value systems. Do they know our Prime Directive? They know everything I know, sir. And... if we were to violate the Prime Directive...? That's not a fair question. How would they react? They would judge us by our own rules, sir. If we violate our own Prime Directive, they might consider us to be deceitful and untrustworthy. They did caution us not to interfere with their children below. What has happened? The Edo want to execute my son. I will not allow that to happen. Most interesting, sir. The emotion of motherhood as compared to others... Shut up! You were right, sir. I do tend to babble. Captain's log, stardate 41255.9. Whatever the object in orbit with us, it hangs there like a Nemesis. It is one thing to communicate with something mysterious, but quite another to be silently observed by it. I am concerned whether it understands the same concept of reason we do. You sent for me, sir? Let's have more talk, Data. Yes, sir. Sit down. What level of communication, sir? Any. My apologies for saying that you babbled. But I do, sir. You also see things as we do not, but as they truly are. I need help, my friend. I cannot permit that boy or anyone from this vessel to be sacrificed. The Prime Directive never intended that. The problem is there. They've learned of the Prime Directive from my mind, but how will they evaluate it? How do they reason? What are their values? Remember their warning to us. Exactly! How do I explain my refusing to obey their laws? Not permitting the Crusher boy... ...to be executed. And by so doing do I endanger this vessel and a thousand other lives? Would you choose one life over one thousand, sir? I refuse to let arithmetic decide questions like that. Did you learn of the relationship between that and the Edo? Why are they so certain it's a god? Any sufficiently advanced life form appears as that to others, sir. But when they were probing my thoughts, I could feel that they once existed in this dimension, just as we do. Perhaps in the same flesh-and-blood form. Since then, however, they have evolved considerably. Their present existence no doubt has advantages we do not understand. In some earlier flesh-and-blood form they might have shared our values? We know the Edo share them. Why would such an advanced thing feel obliged to protect the Edo? Perhaps the Edo are a child race by comparison. Possibly a race which those life forms have planted here. Much as we now plant human colonies on Class-M planets. Having fulfilled my professional obligations regarding Cmdr Data... You now request permission to beam down to the planet. Granted. You can accompany me while I try and resolve this. Know that whatever the cost, I will not allow them to execute your son. Thank you, sir. Data, take command. Aye, sir. It's almost time. I want the boy brought here now. I'll go with you. Of course. Captain Picard. I saw you share the sky with God. You must be gods. No, we are not gods. Mother. I guess you know a lot has happened here. I know. Captain Picard... ...are you going to let them kill me? No. But I must find some way to prevent it that you understand. How can we let this happen, Liator? They threaten everything we respect. Our law, our peace, our tranquility and order. You are powerful. But do not do this to us, we beg you! At least study what we were without law. Hurtful, savage, thieving. I understand. Perhaps your system of law is better than any system we once had. But we do now have a law I must obey. Part of it says I must protect my people from harm. We did not ask you to come here. It has to do with another law that we must obey. We are all sworn not to interfere with other lives in the galaxy. If I save this boy, I break that law. And should be executed if you do. I may suffer almost as much. Starfleet takes the Prime Directive seriously. No, it is God who will punish you. That has crossed our minds. Your god up there may insist that we obey our non-interference directive. Sir, does this mean if you save me then the entire crew could die? You're not involved in this decision, boy. I'm sorry, sir, but it seems like I am. Picard to transporter room, stand by for six to beam up. Wesley... Lieutenant... Our laws have been violated. What of justice? What of justice to Wesley? Does he deserve to die? I'm truly sorry, but I must have justice for my people too. Transporter room, energize. Transporter room, come in! We can't energize the beam, sir. God has prevented your escape. Then God is unfair. My son had no warning of your laws. We cannot allow ignorance of the law to become a defense. I don't know how to communicate this, or even if it's possible. The question of justice has concerned me greatly of late. I say to any creature listening, there can be no justice so long as laws are absolute. Even life itself is an exercise in exceptions. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Seems the Edo lord agrees with you, Number One. Main viewer on. Hailing frequencies. Open, sir. To the object in orbit with us. We will remove the human colonists from the adjoining solar system if you signal us to do so. Please tell us. Captain... Is that a signal? I suppose... I suppose it must be. I was hoping for more. More of what, sir? I'm glad it's gone. Agreed, sir. Short and sweet. God-like efficiency. I was hoping we might learn more about it. But since we can't, take us out of here, Number One. Gladly, sir. "
S1E09,"Captain's log, stardate 41723.9. Following a Starfleet order, we are in the Xendi Sabu star system, having rendezvoused with a Ferengi vessel which requested a meeting. Although we arrived and made appropriate signals three days ago, the Ferengi have responded only with the message, ""Stand by, Enterprise."" You sent for me, sir? Yes, Doctor. Sit down. Look, this... perhaps may be nothing, but I've been feeling... ...a bit odd of late. Fatigued. And now I've got this damned headache. A what? Headache. You know what a headache is. Of course. But I don't often encounter them. The reason is obvious, of course. What are the Ferengi up to? ""Stand by, Enterprise."" Stand by for what? I don't see a thing wrong. No, neither can I. Unless they're baiting some kind of trap. With your head. I see nothing physically wrong, but I'll run some scans in sickbay. All I've got... Is an order. Report to sickbay! From the only person aboard who can give you an order. Captain, from First Officer. They're sending a message. On my way, Number One. Sorry, Doctor. Duty calls. They're prepared to talk, sir. Have they explained the wait? Negative. They've identified their commander as Bok. DaiMon Bok. You can see him. They're communicating on visual. Open hailing frequencies. Frequencies open, sir. This is Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. We are transmitting visually. Is this the Capt Picard? Do we know each other? I know you, Picard. Then you have the advantage of me. Is this Bok? I am Bok, DaiMon of the Ferengi. I have asked you here to discuss a mutual problem, Captain. What problem, DaiMon Bok? I insist on speaking of that matter in person. Shall we meet on your vessel... or mine? Hailing frequencies closed. I sense considerable deception on Bok's part. And danger. Then we should meet him here. Keep him under our control. Now open, sir. I appreciate your offer, DaiMon Bok. Please be our guest here. As you wish, Picard. Perhaps this will begin a new era of cooperation for both our peoples. In one Earth hour, then? In one hour, DaiMon Bok. End transmission. I can't believe they're coming here. They did agree a bit easily. Well, in one hour we shall know why. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Are you accustomed to getting your own way? Only when it makes sense. There's 40 minutes until the Ferengi beam over. I'll have these scans done in ten. A lot of effort for a simple headache. You should not have a headache unless something's wrong. It's true that headaches were once quite common, before the brain was charted, before we understood the nature of pain. When we suffered from things such as the common cold. So what's the cause of my headache? I haven't the slightest idea. Feel better? The pain's gone. Medical fakery. The pain is actually still there. It's just cloaked. I'll want further exams. Doctor! When the Ferengi matter is settled. Expect an intruder alert. What? Have you something to report? If you'll scan heading 44, mark 163... Intruder alert, sir. I've got something, sir. An old-style starship, Constellation class, traveling on impulse power. Says who? Ensign, answer the First Officer's question. Says the long-distance sensors, sir. I was boosting the sensor output... Boosting it? How? We will discuss this later. I'm reading it now, as a Constellation-class starship traveling under impulse power. Sending no call letters. The correct procedure... What's wrong, sir? It's nothing. It's just a... mild headache. The correct procedure, Ensign, was to signal the bridge immediately. Yes, sir. Bringing it here personally, perhaps to be on hand for the Ferengi beam-over, might have imperiled us were it something hostile. Yes, sir. Receiving no signal from the approaching starship. Time, sir. Time? For the Ferengi beam-over. Do you see any problem connected with this old starship? It's safer to have the Ferengi here, whatever. Concur. Stand by. Hailing frequencies open. Welcome in peace, DaiMon Bok. It is our pleasure, Capt Picard. Might I introduce my First Officer, Kazago, and my Second, Rata? This is my First Officer, Cmdr William Riker. Second-in-command, Data. Counselor Troi. We have heard that you use females. Clothed females. Most interesting. They are that, sir. And the android was mentioned, too. What is its price? We should like to... purchase it. He is not for sale. Cmdr Data is... Second-hand merchandise. You wouldn't want him. Second-hand, sir? Of course. A human joke. Excuse me, Captain. The unidentified starship is coming. Still no signal. Think nothing of it. It is under our control. One of our starships under your control? Do not be alarmed, Captain. It is a gift from us. With which we honor the hero of Maxia. Who? Why you, Picard, of course. Do you not remember the Battle of Maxia? I'm sorry, I do not remember it, DaiMon Bok. Data? He may refer to an encounter nine years ago, in the Maxia Zeta system. An unidentified starship... Unidentified?! That fine vessel was Ferengi. Which... you destroyed, sir. The Battle of Maxia. I never heard it referred to so dramatically before. My sincere regrets, but that vessel refused to identify itself. It simply attacked us. We defended ourselves. Such... mistakes happen in space. Hardly a mistake, sir. Your report shows it deliberately attacked. Do you want arriving vessel on main viewer? It's 1,000 kilometers away. Put it on your viewer. Main viewer. There is no one aboard it. The log should be downloaded into the Enterprise's records. At a price. No price! No price? What is the purpose of this? What... I felt something too, Captain. Perhaps it is... his conscience. Bridge to sickbay... No, I'm fine. It felt as if... it were something from your past. It's alright. I'm fine. What is this about? It is about the battle I mentioned, Captain. A gift, in honor of that occasion. Look at that ship closely. Magnify it, please, Lt La Forge. Aye, sir. Why... ...it's the Stargazer. It's my old ship. How did you find it? It was a derelict. Adrift in space on the far side of this star system. How it got there is none of my business, Captain. But now... that vessel is yours, if you wish to have it. We are not selling it to him? Consider it... an act of friendship. At no cost? Ugly! Very ugly! Captain's log, supplemental. Bok and his officers have returned to their vessel, inviting us to take possession of the Stargazer. Like before? No, it hit with more impact. Hit? I'm sorry, but anything could be important. You felt something yourself? I believe so. Like a thought, but... rather mechanical in nature. Sure it wasn't one of my thoughts? At that moment, I was remembering being at the helm of the Stargazer. A maneuver was being made. We were hit. Something's burning. I can smell smoke. Can you? There's nothing burning, Jean-Luc. That was just part of my memory. Memory or nightmare? It was strong, whatever it was. Ready, Number One? Staff's waiting, if Dr Crusher approves. I'll do better than that. I'll go along. We were traveling through the Maxia system. An unidentified ship appeared and fired on us, point-blank range. Where did it come from? It must have been lying in some deep moon crater. First attack damaged the shields. In the confusion, they hit us again. No clue who they were? No names, no reason. Can you identify them, Vigo? lf they come a second time... Sir, who's Vigo? My weapons officer on the Stargazer. I'm getting caught up in this. Your shields were failing, sir. I... improvised. With the enemy vessel coming in for the kill, I ordered a sensor bearing. When it made the return arc... You performed what Starfleet texts now call the Picard Maneuver. I did what any good helmsman would. Dropped into high warp, stopped right off the enemy's bow, and fired! Blowing into maximum warp, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Our attacker fired on the wrong one. ""I did what any good helmsman would""! You did it first, sir. It was a save-our-skins maneuver. We were finished. On fire. We had to abandon ship. We limped through space in shuttles for weeks before we were picked up. I haven't thought about this for years. Sir, the Ferengi are waiting for us to take possession of the Stargazer. I want to go over to her. I understand, sir. As soon as my people make sure she's safe. And after I have another look at you. USS Stargazer. Constellation class. Starfleet Registry NCC-2893. I activated the emergency power cells. Amazing they still work. The rest of this ship is clear of surprises, Lt Yar. I read of this ship at the Academy. I never dreamed I'd ever be on her. Yar to Enterprise. All clear, sir. Hello, old friend. You'll find this most intriguing, sir. What did you find, Data? The last entry, dated nine years ago, sir. By you. ""We are forced to abandon our starship."" ""May she find her way without us."" Apparently she did, sir. How do you feel, Captain? I'm fine, Doctor. Lt Yar, run a structural analysis on the Stargazer for an impulse tow. Data, download all computers to the Enterprise and file. I'm going to look at my old cabin. Try this, hero of Maxia! Captain? Another headache? This worries me. I want you back on the Enterprise. But my things... I'll see they're sent to your Enterprise quarters. Enterprise now taking possession of Stargazer, Kazago. Permission granted. It was quite a bargain. I thought the Ferengi always made a profit. Subwarp speed for towing, La Forge. Aye, sir. Starfleet has answered our request. A tug will meet us and tow the Stargazer back to Xendi Starbase 9. Very well, Data. How was it, Captain? Very strange, Number One. Like going back to the house you grew up in, but no one's home. Except phantoms of the past. It has troubled you? Not half as much as this damned headache. Take over, Number One. Aye, sir. What's wrong? I wish I could say. Shields weakening, Captain. Torpedoes armed. Where are they? Oh, my God, sir! Fire! What is it, Data? Why all the mystery? The records of the Stargazer. What the Ferengi call the Battle of Maxia. The Captain's personal log contains a much different version of that conflict than the official account. What are you saying? It appears that the starship which Capt Picard attacked had been under a flag of truce. What? He destroyed the ship without notice or provocation. What about the fire on the Stargazer? An accident in Engineering. And what proof? It is logged in his own voice, sir. Would you care to hear it, sir? Sir? This is a confession given by me, Jean-Luc Picard, commanding USS Stargazer. What is this? I don't know. Sounds like you. It is! I refuse to believe you said that. I must have mistaken their subspace antenna for a weapons cluster. Unfortunately, I fired our main phasers and our direct hit destroyed the unknown vessel. I assume they simulated your voice. I already put Data to work on it. I never made that log entry, but it leaves you with a duty to perform. I know, sir. I must report to Starfleet. That's at least one day for communication to reach there. And one more day for their answer to return. I'd like the truth of this by then. I'd hate to prepare a formal defense. They can't ask for your command. Why not? With the Ferengi making friendship overtures, I'd be a severe embarrassment to Starfleet. I'm sure the Ferengi are behind the faked log. No wonder they're waiting out there. Headache back, sir? Damn! I'll call the Doctor again. It's no wonder, with all this going on. Try to relax. This is a confession given by me, Jean-Luc Picard, commanding USS Stargazer, in the hopes that my belated honesty will be considered by Starfleet, when judging my actions during a confrontation with an unidentified vessel. Open hailing frequencies, Geordi. I'll take it in the ready room. Secure channel. Secure, sir. Starship Ferengi, this is Cmdr Riker here. I'd like to speak to First Officer Kazago. A problem, Riker? Are our channels secure? It is now. You know the details of the Battle of Maxia? Capt Bok has made me aware of it. The infamy of your Picard is now known. Infamy? I'd call the wanton destruction of an unarmed vessel infamy. And if I produced evidence that Capt Picard's log entry was falsified... I hardly imagine you contacted me to discuss an ancient battle. What do you want of me? One question. As you humans say, I'm all ears. First Officer to First Officer, Kazago. If your Capt Bok knew about this, why this peaceful meeting to present the Stargazer? We give back your derelict warship and you accuse us of crime, Riker? I can bear no more insults! Yes, who the hell is it? Not resting, Captain? More like dying, Doctor. Over here. What is wrong with me? I wish to hell I knew, but something unusual is definitely happening. Doctors say the obvious like it's a revelation. Captains always act like they're immortal. No! You didn't tell me it had been this bad. It wasn't this bad. But it's getting worse. This should help a little. It must be some emotional pressure connected with the Stargazer. I got this headache long before I even knew my old ship still existed. Still, perhaps you're partly right. Want to talk about it? I'm here. The fight at Maxia. I destroyed an entire vessel. An entire crew. Did you have a choice? I don't know any more. I don't know. Cmdr Riker told me about the altered log if that's troubling you. The last three nights, I've... ...Ive heard these voices. I'm on the bridge of my old ship. There's fire all around me. The klaxons, smoke. And then I give the order. And now the Stargazer is really here. And that log... Am I going crazy? Was I in my right mind at Maxia? Am I in my right mind now? What was that? Something to let you sleep. Yes, sleep. Sleep... Shields weakening, Captain! Torpedoes armed. Where are they? And now, my dear Captain, you are ready to live the past. Where did they come from? Phasers, sir? What should we do, sir? Should we fire back? Fire, Captain? You will injure yourself, as you once injured me. Sir! Damage report. Fusion generator under surge control, sir! Power systems failing. Sensor beam bearing on hostile ship! Seven, mark 19, sir. Phasers, sir? Ready phasers, and lock! Stand by on warp nine. Heading... seven-seven, mark 20. Engage! Steady! Now, reverse and stop! Phasers fire, torpedoes away! Fire. By comparing the Stargazer's main computer log with Capt Picard's personal log, I found some discrepancies, sir. What does that mean? All information is time-coded. The bits produce an aggregate... I don't want a computer-science lesson. Bottom line. One of these two logs is a forgery. Correction. The log just found aboard the Stargazer is a forgery. As I said, that is one of them, is it not? Captain! You're looking better, sir. A little sleep, thanks to the good Doctor, works wonders. What report on the logs? Whoever tampered with your log was clever. But clumsy. It's definitely a fabrication. Number One, I'd like you to take a look at this brain-scan graph... What are you doing here? Aren't I the Captain? Yes, but... Thank you for the confirmation. But now, except for Riker, if you'd all return to your stations. Is that clear? Sir. You too, Doctor. I have business with the Commander. Under protest, sir. You have orders for me? Release the Stargazer from the tractor beam. Sir? The tractor beam. Sir, are you abandoning? No. But her inertia will carry the Stargazer along with us. Or did you sleep through the Academy lecture on the conservation of tractor-beam power? No, sir. I'll release her, of course. Obviously, there's some thought-process disorder. But I can't find a physical reason for it. Anything? I'm puzzled, too. I keep sensing random thoughts. But two sets of them. As if they were his, but intermixed with other thoughts which are also his. I'm busy, Wesley. I know, but this is important. I was at the sensors in Engineering, trying sensitivity tests... Does this have something to do with Capt Picard? Yes, ma'am. If this is what you're talking about. I don't know about brain scans, but I glanced at these. I noticed that these patterns are the same as the low-intensity transmissions from the Ferengi ship. I went back and checked. They're exactly the same. What kind of transmissions? I don't know. Engineering has nothing like it on record. Let's get to the Captain. No, they may affect him. To Riker. You're welcome, ladies. Adults! The Captain? Resting, after ordering you to return to your duty stations. There have been some... Did he say low intensity? Unusual low-intensity transmissions from the Ferengi vessel. Did who say? My son. Transmissions which exactly match certain anomalies found in the Captain's scans. Something over there is affecting the Captain's thought patterns. Computer, give me a location on Capt Picard. Capt Picard is in transporter room three. What? Emergency order to transporter room three. New information. Capt Picard is no longer aboard the Enterprise. Welcome back, Captain. What is happening? Shields up, computer. What are you doing? Collecting on an old debt. Stargazer, Captain, respond! Shields up. No way to beam over. I'm reading something very strange here. A low-intensity beam of intermittent pulse, inside this starship. I have a fix on it, sir. Inside Capt Picard's quarters. You transferred his belongings from the Stargazer? Yes. Including a fairly heavy chest. Take a look, fast! Commander, Stargazer is now powering up, sir. I have been waiting a long nine years for this, Picard. I don't know what you mean. Do you not, human? Can you not remember the crime you committed against my very blood? You murdered my only son! Your son? He was commander of the ship you destroyed. On his first voyage as DaiMon. The ship...? The Ferengi vessel that attacked me. Or is it about to attack me? And I have spent these years, searching... seeking... ...a proper blood revenge! And I found it! I am rich, Picard. Yet, two of these cost me the profits of an entire life! You are back in command of the Stargazer, Picard. Its computers will answer your orders. Die well, Captain! First Officer's log. Capt Picard has beamed aboard the Stargazer, which is moving away from us under its own power. Enterprise to Stargazer, please respond! Enterprise to Capt Picard aboard Stargazer. Please answer! Data, what was Stargazer's condition? Fire damage to interior surfaces, but no main systems were crippled. Armaments, Lt Yar? Six photon torpedoes short from when the Captain destroyed the Ferengi. Otherwise fully armed. What is it, La Forge? A network of miniature circuitry. Incredibly complex. Maybe an amplifier. Where was it in the Captain's quarters? His chest from the Stargazer, sir? Where I left it. He hadn't unpacked. He may not have known it was there. If this can pick up or magnify thought-altering transmissions... It could prepare him for what's happening now. Let's find out. Or try to. Contact the Ferengi vessel, Lieutenant. Hailing frequencies open, sir. Enterprise to Ferengi vessel. We transmit visually. Do you respond? Why is our gift to you under power, human? I'll discuss it with your Captain. He is in our laboratory. Where is your Captain? He's beamed aboard the Stargazer. I'm wondering if this has something to do with it. How do you have possession of that? It was in our Captain's chest, from the Stargazer. It is a forbidden device. A... thought-maker. If your Captain is criminal enough to own one... You know who controls those spheres. I ask you again. First Officer to First Officer. What's going on? It is not seemly to question one's own DaiMon, Riker. I am not prepared to do that. Sir, I have the Stargazer. Switch, now! Enterprise to Picard. Do not attack again! We're on a peaceful mission! Give your identity! You force us to defend ourselves. Phasers full up. Arm torpedoes. Why aren't the shields at full power? We've lost him, sir. When he put up the shields. Damn! I said get the fusion generators under surge control! You're moving much too slowly! Arm the torpedoes, man! Vigo, get a fire-control party up here! Shields weakening, Captain. Fusion generator on line. Weapons report? Phasers coming to full charge. Torpedoes armed. Who are they? Identify them. They're coming for a third pass at us. We can't take another hit, Captain. Sir, I now feel anger from our Captain. Fury over whatever he is reliving out there. The Battle of Maxia, sir. The Picard Maneuver. What is the defense, Data? There is no defense, sir. Devise one. Fast! First Officer Kazago to human Riker. Not now, Kazago. We do not wish to become involved in what is clearly a Federation matter. Fine, fine. Enterprise out. You should know that DaiMon Bok no longer commands this vessel. His First Officer has confined him for engaging in this unprofitable venture. Good luck, First Officer Riker. I have computed a possibility. Deep space contains trace gases. A vessel in the Picard Maneuver might seem to disappear, but our sensors can locate compression of these gases. An aiming point to blow up our Captain? This class starship has enough power to use our tractor beam on it. Seize it. Limit its field of fire. Concentrate shields at that point. Make it so. I hope you're right. No question of it, sir. Stand by. Lock on tractor beam. Ready phasers. Capt Picard. Listen to me. Vigo, is that you? It's Cmdr Riker, sir. Captain, hear me! Look around. The Ferengi are using thought devices on you. Stand by. Who is this? It's Riker, sir. Your Number One. Look for a silver sphere. Destroy it with your phaser! Phaser... A sphere. Bok used it. Destroy it! Phaser... Destroy the sphere. Are you alright, Captain? Captain... ? Captain, are you alright? Where am I, Number One? Aboard the Stargazer, sir. The sphere was controlling your... Bok! Where is Bok? Removed from command. Placed under guard for his act of vengeance. Seems there was no profit in it. In revenge, there never is. Let the dead rest. And the past... ...remain the past. Enterprise, lock on. Beam me home, Riker. "
S1E10,"Captain's log, stardate 41590.5. Having dropped off Counselor Troi for a visit home, we were fortunately close to the Sigma III system when its Federation colony made an urgent call for medical help. An accidental explosion has devastated a mining operation. Include a burn unit with each kit. Identify the most critically injured and beam them to cargo bay six. Dr Crusher, this is the Captain. Dr Crusher here. Additional information. The number of colonists at the site is 504. Are you prepared for that many? We believe so, sir. Captain, we are now at warp 9.1, sir. We will be at the colony in 3.2 hours, sir. Schematics suggest the explosion was caused by a methane-like gas seeping in from underground. Captain, I'm picking up a force field. It's... The Q entity. It's identical to the grid we encountered... It reads solid, sir. Emergency. Full stop. Reversing power, sir. Not now, damn it, Q. Shields and deflectors up, sir. Now reading full stop, sir. Humans. I thought by now you'd have scampered back to your own little star system. If this is Q I'm addressing, we are on a mission of rescue... We the Q have studied our contact with you, and are impressed. We have much to discuss, including perhaps the realization of your most impossible dream. Intriguing as that is, we are on an urgent journey. After, perhaps... You will abandon it! My business with you takes precedence. If my magnificence blinds you, then perhaps something more familiar. Starfleet Admiral Q, at your service. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, supplemental. Our rescue mission to Sigma III has been halted by an immense grid and an untimely visit from Q. You're no Starfleet Admiral, Q. Neither am I an Aldebaran serpent, Captain, but you accepted me as such. He's got us there, Captain! The redoubtable Cmdr Riker, whom I noticed before. You seem to find this all very amusing. I might, if we weren't on our way to help some suffering, dying humans... Your species is always suffering and dying. No, Lt Worf! Make no move against him unless I order it. Pity! You might have learned an interesting lesson. Macro head with a micro brain! You said you had the realization of impossible dreams to offer us. When this rescue is completed, I will listen to your proposal. Subject to its being acceptable... Subject to foolish human values? Picard, why do you distrust me so? Why? At our first meeting, you seized my vessel. You condemned all humans as savages and tried us in a post-atomic 21st-century court of horrors, attacked my people and again seized my vessel! And that angered you? ""Seized my vessel!"" You interfered with our Farpoint mission. You threatened to convict us as ignorant savages, if, while dealing with a powerful life form, we made any mistake, and when we didn't... The Q became interested in you. Does no one here understand your good fortune? ""Seized my vessel!"" The complaints of a closed mind, too accustomed to military privileges. But you, Riker, and I remember you well, what do you make of my offer? We don't have time for these games. Games? Did someone say games? And, perchance for interest's sake, a deadly game? To the game. Where are we? A Class-M world. Gravity and oxygen within our limits. Twin moons. Where are we? Considering the power demonstrated by Q the last time... anywhere. Assuming this place even exists. But it won't be boring. If Q is anything, he's imaginative. Seems our Captain wasn't meant to be here. Security, this is the Captain. Security? Engineering, this is the bridge. Turbolift control, do you read? This is the Captain. Sir! Over there! Join me, Riker. A good game needs rules and planning. Didn't your own Hartley say, ""Nothing reveals humanity so well as the games it plays""? Almost right. Actually, you reveal yourselves best in how you play. Sir, what he has in mind might provide us with vital information. Incredible. I was just thinking about an old-fashioned lemonade. And so it became that. An excellent thirst-quencher. It gets rather hot out here on this plain. What about my people? Whatever they'd like, of course. ""Drink not with thine enemy."" The rigid Klingon code. That explains something of why you defeated them. Still fascinated with the human past? Perhaps you're not that original. Au contraire. It's the human future which intrigues us. And it should concern you the most. Of all the species, yours cannot abide stagnation. Change is the heart of what you are. But into what? That's the question. That is what humans call... a truism. You mean hardly original? You're the one who said it. While we're at it... this isn't part of any human future. True. I borrowed this from your stodgy Captain's mind. This is the dressing for a game we will play. Now, games require rules, rewards, dangers, familiar settings. That sort of thing. This isn't that familiar to me. Data? This is from Europe's Napoleonic era. Late-18th, early-19th centuries. This is a campaign-headquarters tent. His uniform is that of a French Army marshal. Outranking even an admiral. Would I go from a Starfleet admiral to anything else? Of course you wouldn't. But Napoleonic equipment on an alien planet, one so different it has twin moons? As you said, I am nothing if not imaginative. The game should reflect that. Shall it be a test of strength? Meaningless, since you have none. A test of intelligence, then? Equally as meaningless! But it needs risk, something to win. And something to lose. If we must play a game, what would we win? The greatest possible future you can imagine. Which requires something totally disastrous if you lose. The point of this game shall be, can any of you stay alive? If your game is fair, we will. For shame, Worf! Fairness is such a human concept. Think imaginatively! This game shall in fact be... completely unfair. You've gone too far! Game penalty! Where is she, Q? You can forget your game... To use a 20th-century term, she's in a penalty box. She'll remain there unharmed unless one of you merits a penalty. Unfortunately, there's only one box. If any of you are sent there, dear Tasha must give the box up. And where does she go? Into nothingness! I entreat you to obey the rules of the game. The only one who can destroy your Tasha now is you. Captain's log... Damn it. I can't even make a log entry. I wish I could help you, Captain. Where is everyone else? Down on some planet. Some planet? Why are you here? Well, I... It sounds strange... ...but, I'm in a penalty box. A penalty box? Q's penalty box. It sounds strange, but it definitely isn't. I know that one more penalty... ...by anyone... and I'm gone. Gone? Yes! I am gone! It is so frustrating to be controlled like this! Lieutenant... Tasha, it's alright. What in the hell am I doing? Crying?! Don't worry. There is a new standing order on the bridge. When one is in the penalty box, tears are permitted. Captain... If you weren't a captain... Consorting with lower-rank females? Especially ones in penalty boxes? Destructive to discipline, they say. But then again, you're what? Only human. Penalty... over. A marshal of France? Ridiculous! One takes the jobs he can get. For example, starlog entry, stardate today. This is Q speaking for Capt Jean-Luc Picard, who we consider too bound by Starfleet customs and traditions to be useful to us. The Enterprise is now helpless, stuck like an Earth insect in amber, while its bridge crew plays out a game, whose real intent is to test whether the First Officer is worthy of the greatest gift the Q can offer. So, you're taking on Riker this time. Excellent. He'll defeat you, just as I did. Shall we wager on that? Your starship command against... Against your keeping out of humanity's path for ever! Done? Done. You've already lost. Riker will be offered something impossible to refuse. Geordi, can you see Worf? I'd see the freckles on his nose if he had them, sir. He's at the third ridge. The third ridge? Moving well, too. Good. He sees them. Listen to me, Q. You seem to have some need for humans. Concern regarding them. Why do you demonstrate it through this confrontation? Why not a simple, direct explanation, a statement of what you seek? Why these games? Why these games? Why, the play's the thing! I'm surprised you need ask. Your human Shakespeare explained it all. He did but don't depend on one view... A pity you don't know the content of your own library. Hear this, and reflect. ""All the galaxy's a stage..."" World, not galaxy. ""All the world's a stage."" You know it. If he were living now, he'd have said galaxy. How about this? ""Life is but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more."" ""It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."" I see. So how we respond to a game tells you more about us than our real life? This... tale told by an idiot. Interesting. Thank you. Glad you enjoyed it. Perhaps a little Hamlet? I know Hamlet. What he might say with irony, I say with conviction. ""What a piece of work is man. How noble in reason."" ""How infinite in faculty."" ""In form, in moving, how express and admirable."" ""In action, how like an angel. In apprehension, how like a god."" You don't see your species like that? I see us one day becoming that, Q. Is it that which concerns you? Those soldiers have formed a skirmishing line, I think it is. And they're headed this way. Armed with ball-and-powder muskets? That's what they look like, sir. Muskets are appropriate to the 1790-1800 French uniform, sir. But it is hardly a weapon by our standards. A lead ball propelled by gunpowder. 100 meters at best, with accuracy. Against phasers? Just one phaser could finish off an entire regiment. Except that it hardly sounds like Q to give us an advantage like that. Unless... Drop your weapons! That was me, Worf. I was checking that the phasers still operate. Incredible. He came out of nowhere. A warrior's reaction. Report. What did you find? They may wear old Earth uniforms, but they aren't human at all. More like vicious animal things. Those soldiers are moving in fast, sir. Data, if you've got a theory about what's happening... Think fast, Cmdr Riker, and move fast. Those aren't muskets! You have one chance to save them. Send them back to the ship. You'll let me beam them? Send them the same way I do. I've given you the power. Do you understand? I've given you the power of the Q. Use it. Use your power. Use your power. Lieutenant, take the conn position. Engineering? Engineering, sir. Are all systems back on line? Back on line, sir? They were never off. Captain, you'd better look at this. There's been no interruption in course or speed. Both are constant. It's as though we never stopped. We never did, Lieutenant. Q suspended time. Where's Cmdr Riker? He was with us. He must still be on the planet. We were under attack by these... animal things. Animal things? Maybe Data can explain better, sir. You may find it aesthetically displeasing. I'll file a report. Data... Sir, the important thing is why is Cmdr Riker missing? Understood. But I suspect Cmdr Riker is perfectly safe, at least in a physical sense. Q has an interest in him. In fact, Q's entire visit concerns our First Officer. And the reason for that, sir? I wish I knew. Q first became interested in him at Farpoint. I have no idea what it means. Meanwhile, we must proceed with our rescue mission. Something amuses you? Perhaps you'll share the joke with me. The joke is you! Strange gratitude, from one who has been granted a gift beyond any human dream. How can you not appreciate being able to send your friends to their ship, or send the soldiers back to the nothingness from which they came? You must understand that you can send yourself back to the ship, or to Earth, or change your shape, become anything you want to be. What do you need? Need? You want something from us. Desperately. Want something from you foolish, fragile nonentities? Come, Riker! You sound like your Captain. Now, that's a compliment, Q, but not an answer. Riker, we have offered you a gift beyond all other gifts! Out of the goodness of your heart. After Farpoint, I returned to where we exist, the Q Continuum. Which means what? The limitless dimensions of the galaxy in which we exist. I don't understand. Of course you don't. And you never will, until you become one of us. Until? Would you mind going over that again? If you'd stop interrupting me! This is hardly a time to be teaching you the true nature of the universe. However... At Farpoint... we saw you as savages only. We discovered instead that you are unusual creatures... ...in your own limited ways. Ways which, in time, will not be so limited. We're growing. Something about us compels us to learn, explore. Yes, the human compulsion. Unfortunately for us, this power will grow stronger, century after century, aeon after aeon. Aeons... Have you any idea how far we'll advance? Perhaps in a future that you cannot yet conceive, even beyond us. You see, we must know more about this human compulsion. That's why we selected you to become part of the Q, so you can bring to us this human need and hunger, that we may better understand it. I suppose that's meant as a compliment. Or maybe it's my limited mind. But to become a part of you? I don't even like you. You're gonna miss me. Come on! Not again! Cmdr Riker, what's going on? I was sitting in school and... Worf! My phaser's gone. Are you armed? No. Where is Q? lf you have an answer to any of this... Look out! Wesley! No! No, damn it! Damn it to hell! You... ! You did that! And that's not all! That grid, their wounds... Only the Q can do that. Captain's log, stardate 41591.4. 1 minutes out from Quadra Sigma III, where the survivors of a disaster desperately need us. On the Enterprise, First Officer William T Riker needs help nearly as badly. But this is a subject far out of my experience. Out of any human's experience. How the hell do I advise you? You know the implications as well as I. No one has ever offered to turn me into a god before. What the Q has offered you has to be close to immortality. It's no lie about controlling time and space. We've seen it in what they can do. And in what I can do. If you are to refuse his offer, you must not use this power again. It's too great a temptation at our present stage of development. You fear I won't be able to say no? You tell me. Are you strong enough to refuse to use that power? Certainly. No matter how tempted? No matter how difficult Q makes it? You have my word. Good. I know what your word means. In orbit of Quadra Sigma III. Ready to beam down rescue team to underground emergency area. This way, sir. Are there any others? Gone. It's just us. Commander! There's somebody under here! You're getting close, Data. It's too late. She's dead. If only we'd gotten here a little sooner. Sir, if indeed you have the power of Q... I don't understand. Certainly you can't bring her back to life. I can't. I'm prevented from that by a promise. I was wrong to make that agreement. I could have saved that child. You were right not to try. Once you get accustomed to that power... When I used it before, I saved most of our bridge crew! And when you grow to like it too much? As soon as it's convenient, I want a meeting with you and your bridge staff. As soon as we are secure with this rescue operation, I'll discuss all that this new power... We can confer here, if no one objects. The bridge is fine. I've called the entire staff. Correction. Knowing the decision you face, I have permitted you this gathering. Of course, Jean-Luc. Wesley, this meeting is not for you. Why not, sir? You helped make me a bridge officer. Acting Ensign. Alright. He stays. Because I've been given unusual powers, I'm not suddenly a monster. Except for these abilities, and I don't yet know how far they go, I'm the same William T Riker you've always known. Well? Everyone still looks uncomfortable. Perhaps they all remember that saying, ""power corrupts."" And absolute power corrupts absolutely. You believe I haven't thought of that, Jean-Luc? And have you noticed how you and I are now on a first-name basis? Number One. Will... something has happened already. In what way? Haven't you seen how much I regretted not saving that child? Using the power of Q to save her may not have been wrong. No more than it was wrong to save you from those soldier things. Let's keep in mind that that particular danger was invented by Q. What we represent to the Q, Commander, are lowly animals, tormented into performing for their amusement. Actually, they think very highly of us. We have a quality of growth which they admire. Or fear. No, we've learned the Q do not admire us. The Q has muddled your mind. Don't you understand his incredible gift to me? Are these truly your friends, brother? Let us pray. For understanding and for compassion. Let us do no such damn thing! What is this need of yours for costumes? Have you no identity of your own? I come in search of the truth. You come in search of what humanity is! I forgive your blasphemy! Don't you see, Riker? He's nothing but a flimflam man. He has been since we met at Farpoint! Flimflam? You offer Riker jealousy. What I offer is clearly beyond your comprehension. How can you claim friendship for Riker, while obstructing the greatest adventure ever offered a human? Obstructing? Then it's not certain. He's not yet committed. The truly evil part of this is your jealousy. You love each one of your people. Demonstrate it. You have the power to leave each one of them with a gift proving your affection. There'd be no harm to give them something I know they'd like? How touching! A plea to his former Captain. ""May I please give happiness to my friends, sir? Please, sir?"" In fact, I authorize and support your idea, Riker. Please, feel free to cooperate with him if you wish. Are you certain, sir? Quite certain. By all means, demonstrate your gifts of affection. Don't be frightened. There is no way I could harm any of you. Shall I guess your dreams? We'll leave now, Wesley. No! Wesley I may know best of all. Our friendship, our long talks... No, please! Have your favorite wish, my young friend. You're ten years older. A man! Not bad! No! No, sir. But it's what you've always wanted, to become human. Yes, sir. That is true. But I never wanted to compound one... illusion with another. It might be real to Q... ...perhaps even you, sir. But it would never be so to me. Was it not one of the Captain's favorite authors who wrote, ""This above all: to thine own self be true""? Sorry, Commander, I must decline. And you, my friend. I know what you want. You're as beautiful as I imagined. And more. Then we can throw away the visor? I don't think so, sir. The price is a little too high for me. And... I don't like who I'd have to thank. Make me the way I was. Please! Proud warrior Worf! Without a single tie to his own kind. No! She is from a world now alien to me! Worf, is this your idea of sex? This is sex. But I have no place for it in my life now! No place, micro brain? What possesses you? Cmdr Riker, it's too soon for this. Is this because your mother objects? No. I just want to get there on my own. Honest. But it's easier, boy! Listen to Riker! How did you know, sir? I feel like such an idiot. Quite right. So you should. It's over. You have no business here. You have destroyed yourself. Pay off your wager. I recall none! Your fellow Q know you agreed never to trouble humans again, just as they know you failed to tempt a human to join you. No! lf I can do one more thing... I strongly suspect it's some explaining you have to do now. Extraordinary! Captain, we are showing that same hole in time again. Our instruments say we just beamed back from our rescue mission. Sir, how is it that the Q can... ...handle time and space so well, and us so badly? Perhaps someday we will discover that space and time are simpler than the human equation. No coordinates laid in, Number One? Yes, sir. You have my coordinates, La Forge. Aye, sir. On the board. Engage. "
S1E11,"Captain's log, stardate 41294.5. Our destination, the Class-M Beta Cassius planet known as Haven. It is so renowned for its peaceful beauty that some believe it to have mystical healing powers. We will rest and relax... all too briefly, I fear. Such a beautiful world. Legends say it has been known to mend souls and heal broken hearts. Legends which are totally unsupported by fact, Captain. Such legends are the spice of the universe, because they have a way of sometimes coming true. Lt Yar to Cmdr Riker, your presence is requested in transporter room one. Sorry, ladies. Duty calls. You needed me? An object's beaming in from Haven. What? We're not sure. Surface station approval's coming in. Alright, let's bring it in. Odd looking. What's going on? I hold a message for Deanna Troi. Lwaxana Troi and the honorable Miller family will soon arrive. The momentous day is close at hand. Rejoice. No. What's going on? Jewels! Look at these jewels. They're bonding gifts, what you would call wedding presents. Who's getting married? I am. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. I was certain it would never happen, Captain. The years I'd spend on this mission, the distance it has taken me away from home. As you must have heard, genetic bonding is a Betazoid tradition. Steven Miller was my father's closest friend. Your father was human, Deanna. The Millers are human. Will you and your husband be staying with the ship? No, sir. Then... ...I will just say congratulations for now, Deanna. You'll excuse me? Bill... ...more than anything in the world, anything... ...you want to be a starship captain, true? That's not all I want, Deanna. I can feel that. I know you care, within those limits. Did you hear what I said? Every word. This whole thing is still bizarre. I'm sorry. Come dance at my wedding. I'll try. A message from planet Haven, Counselor. They wish to beam the Miller wedding party aboard. I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. Welcome aboard. Quite some starship you have here, Captain. Look forward to this visit. You couldn't be... I'm Deanna. Deanna, darling. You probably don't even remember me. Wyatt was absolutely right. She is a beauty. I'm Wyatt. Isn't this simply beautiful? I knew romance was still alive, somewhere. I'd like you to have this chameleon rose. It changes color with the mood of its owner. It's wonderful. Thank you. When is my mother arriving? Your mother is still on the planet. Why? Is there a place for my parents to rest, Captain? Well, we're not really tired, son. Besides... I'd like to see some of the ship. Steven, you know full well Lwaxana Troi isn't about to beam on board until we leave. So? You can see your quarters now. Show the Millers to their accommodations. I shall join you later. Two more are ready to beam in, sir. So be it. Wyatt seems a fine young man. Yes, he does. But I'm not what he expected. I don't understand. Neither do I, but I'm definitely a surprise of some sort to him. I should warn you, sir, my mother is a little... eccentric. Where is everyone? I hate that. Hello, Mother. Don't say it. Think it. Use your mind, not your mouth. Hello, Mother. Deanna, shame. What has this life done to you? No, don't tell me, you're the Captain. Deanna explained your telepathic abilities. That wasn't telepathy, just common sense. Who else would they send but the Captain? You may carry my luggage. Mother! No, that's quite alright. I'm indebted to your mother for the fine counselor she... This way. It's inappropriate... Yes, you seem to be struggling. A man your age must keep in shape. Mother, I won't go another step. A starship has its customs, just as we do. If you're my mother's valet, then please valet. Don't let me keep you from your duty. I apologize for her behavior. You've embarrassed your Captain. No. Anything to avoid a quarrel on this occasion. It's amazing how your accent reminds me of your father. Your last valet tried to rid me of it. What happened to Mr. Xelo? I had to terminate his employment. Xelo was attracted to me. His thoughts became truly pornographic. The thoughts of Wyatt's father were almost as vulgar. But he doesn't have... Passenger accommodation. He doesn't have Xelo's imagination. Between him and that woman's inane chatter, it's a wonder I made it. How do you like the Millers? Very pleasant... It's shocking how they've changed since my husband and I knew them. It's probably because I've grown beyond them. You realize that with Betazoids, our ability to read thoughts does see us grow faster than the typical plodding human. Mother, that's enough! So, you're not totally out of practice. Good. Very good. We hope you find this comfortable. Yes. The room is adequate. Small, but adequate. You will adjust the temperature to a civilized level? I'll see what I can do. Now, if you will excuse me, I'm sure you have much to talk about. Yes, Captain. You may go. You've been slack, little one, allowed your mental powers to rust. Only to avoid confusion, Mother. Humans constantly think one thing and say another. They do, don't they? Poor dears. Our style of complete honesty frightens them. On that subject, Mother, there is such a thing as too much honesty with humans. If they'd only say what they think instead of hiding it. A shipload of such inconsistency could drive one insane. Darling, I'm terribly sorry about what happened here. Truly I am. Steven Miller tracked me down and reminded me of our vows. Mother, I'm having trouble believing in those vows as once I did. Deanna. But I'll honor them, of course. I'm a Betazoid. You may find Wyatt an unusual person. I've sensed remarkable depths in him. Message coming in from Haven. On screen. I'm Valeda Innis, First Electorine of Haven. Capt Picard? Greetings, Electorine. I'm Picard. Your presence honors us, and your timing's fortuitous. In what way? An incoming vessel has bypassed our stargate, violating our law. It has refused any attempt at communication. Do you believe it to be hostile? Not communicating is hostile. We have no defensive capabilities. Our treaty with the Federation specifies your obligations in that matter. Agreed. But let's hope it doesn't become a defense matter. Of course, Captain, but I am very happy we have you here. Come in. I wanted to apologize for my mother's behavior. Your mother's honest. I respect that. Yes. She never lets up. I'll admit, her honesty is a bit persistent. I never heard it described better. But it is a Betazoid trait. I'll try to be only half as annoying. Let's see... What can I tell you about myself? I'm a medical doctor, for what that's worth. Doctor? If you were sensing my thoughts, you'd know. You can do that, can't you? Sometimes. This must be what Mother felt about you. We could read each other eventually. Can I take that as a compliment? Absolutely. I only ever felt this... ...well, with someone who's on this ship. Do I have competition? No. What he wants most is to captain a starship. What I want is to cure people. Well, I'm a practicing psychologist. Maybe we could work in concert. We are going to be together a long time. Yes. That is the point of marriage, I suppose. I really thought you'd tell me you were an artist. I just felt your mind very much on these. They are your work, aren't they? I can see that it'll be hard to keep secrets from you. This is why you were surprised when you first saw me. This woman. You thought I would be this woman. I have seen this face... ...ever since I was a boy. When I closed my eyes at night, I could hear her whispering my name. Knowing you were Betazoid, I assumed it was you projecting yourself into my mind. I'm sorry I'm not what you wished. No. Please don't mistake a childish fantasy for disappointment. You are so beautiful. I feel honored. You've no idea who she is? It doesn't really matter now. Captain's personal log. I trust my concern over the problems of Counselor Troi are not based merely on losing a highly valuable crew member. But I feel that she's trapped by a custom of her world which 24th-century life has made unwise and unworkable. I wish I could intervene. On the viewer, Captain. Unidentified vessel traveling at subwarp speed, bearing 235.7. Subwarp? It's several hours away, then. Let's take a look. Enlarge to maximum. Increasing magnification, sir. Mr. Data, is that the trouble I believe it is? If you mean a Tarellian vessel, sir... it is. Aren't the Tarellians all dead? What are they doing here? Picard to sickbay. Dr Crusher to bridge, urgent. They must not be permitted to destroy us. Or the planet. Captain's log supplemental. It has been believed the Tarellian race was extinct, an assumption contradicted by one of their vessels approaching Haven. Its present velocity suggests a possible answer. A damaged vessel could explain it. Without warp speed, it would take this long to get here. Go on with your briefing, Mr. Data. Tarella was Class-M, like Earth, with similar humanoid life forms. Unfortunately, hatred overpowered intelligence. There were hostilities? Between the inhabitants of two land masses. One group unleashed a deadly biological weapon on the other. In the end, both became infected. Makes one question the sanity of humanoid forms. Can you identify the origin of the infection? They had reached Earth's late 20th-century level of knowledge. That's all you need if you're a fool. A deadly, infectious virus which is not difficult to grow. We learnt the story in training. Some Tarellians went to other worlds, but died along with the populations they infected. It's well covered in Academy training. Many tried to avoid civilized worlds, only to be hunted down and destroyed. It was believed that the last Tarellian ship was destroyed eight years ago by the Alcyones. Yes, sir. Exactly when will they arrive? Exactly 13 hours, 9 minutes, 22 seconds, 350... Thank you. Which creates a difficult problem for us. Our treaty requires us to protect Haven, and Federation policy requires that we assist life forms in need, which must include the Tarellians. I shall want you to help find answers. Thank you. However, there will be time for a second, voluntary assignment, the pre-joining announcement of Counselor Deanna Troi... ...and Wyatt Miller. We've talked it over, and the ceremony will be tomorrow. And Captain, would it be possible for you to perform the ceremony? Of course, if all parties request it. All parties do not request it. It's out of the question. You are not practiced in the ways of Betazed joining. That's quite true. So you are totally unqualified. He is qualified to lead a traditional Earth ceremony, which is what this will be. I thought you had no sense of humor. Earth wedding? Ridiculous! We live on Earth now. So that's why you want that backward ritual. Terrible to see a woman go downhill like this. Mother! Downhill? The matter is settled. Mr. Homn will conduct the joining. But... Homn can't even talk! No matter, he is adept in sign language. The matter is closed. Who are you to tell us what we should do? Your ignorance is astonishing. I am Lwaxana Troi, daughter of the Fifth House, holder of the Sacred Chalice, heir to the Holy Rings of Betazed. Who are you? It is a Starfleet tradition that at social gatherings, disputes are not permitted. I hereby declare therefore all disagreements resolved. A toast. To the young couple, and their families. And? And may this union be a productive one. Hear, hear. Cheers. Considering the rate at which you imbibe, sir, is your lineage at all mixed with human? Is it true, Captain, that there's a Tarellian ship headed for Haven? Yes, it is true. That's amazing. I've read everything about them. Virus analysis was my favorite subject at medical school. Then I'd very much like to confer with you. I'm pleased to have a medical colleague on board. Yes, ma'am... Doctor. Would it be possible to prepare medical needs geared toward the Tarellians' needs? Then beam it over to avoid infection. What do you think? It's a very considerate idea. Our sickbay is at your disposal. Thank you. Mr. Data? Sir? You're circling the room like a buzzard. Perhaps being human yourself, you do not find them as... ...intriguing as I. Must he do that? It is the Betazed way of giving thanks for our food. You giving thanks? Besides, you never did this before. I do it now. Unlike some people, I am in growth. Victoria, I've forgotten whether you enjoy pets or not. Love them, of course. Good. Gently. Poor baby, did she hurt you? If you'll excuse me, I'd like to spend time considering... ...the Tarellian situation. Yes, of course. Ladies and gentlemen. Mrs. Troi, I'm very interested in the Betazed ceremony you mentioned. Could you tell us more? I'd be delighted. It's an ancient ceremony, regarded as the most beautiful in the universe. After the couple remove their clothing... Bride and groom go naked? All guests go unclothed. It honors the act of love being celebrated. Don't worry. Your body's not that bad. Besides, your husband quite likes the idea of seeing me unclothed. Steven! You did know he's attracted to me? Untrue. I don't... Stop this petty bickering, all of you! Especially you, Mother! Could you please continue the petty bickering? I find it most intriguing. May I join you? I will miss you, Deanna. I'm no longer Imzadi to you? You taught me that word means ""my beloved."" And the human heart is too small to permit that feeling now. Have you discussed this with Wyatt? I think you should. It's also damned unfair to me. I understand. I should've realized. Humans, young human males particularly, have difficulty separating platonic love and physical love. The problem is... ...Imzadi... ...I couldn't. Not now. Call it an old... an old Earth tradition... ...habit of the beasts, whatever. Hello, you two. We were just talking about you. This is incredible! Yes. And in that discussion, I... Actually... Bill was concerned that you might be upset that I care deeply for him, too. You're the one who wants to be a starship captain. I've heard that bonding would complicate things in that case. To each his own. Good luck with that ambition. And I very much respected what you did tonight. All I did was lose my temper. Excuse me. Of course. Running all this is a big job. In fact... you shamed them into compromise. So they've decided that the joining will be half Betazed, half Earth. The Captain will do the ceremony and Mr. Homn will be my best man. And we'll take half our clothes off? Some of us still go naked. You do, I do, your mother, my father, but not my mother or the guests. Capt Picard will be very relieved. How did you manage it? Your mother relented. And I caught my father practicing naked in front of his mirror. And so... ...a question I should've asked before. Deanna, do you really want to go through with this? Yes, I want to. I'm a very lucky man. Captain's log, supplemental. All attempts at warning off the Tarellian ship have failed. They still refuse to communicate, and I'm growing concerned. How do you know they're receiving us? Our sensors show a responder echo on the frequency they once used. We have a message, sir, coming in from Haven. On viewer. Captain, the plague ship is approaching transporter range. We are aware of that. Do you realize they can turn our wonderful world into a graveyard? Please, take action now before it's too late. We recognize your situation. Please destroy them now. We will not fire on them. You must. I'm certain I could disable their ship with a phaser burst. And then, Lieutenant? They're within transporter range. Then we can't delay any longer. Ready the tractor beam, Lt Yar. Target the ship. Activate on command. Tractor beam ready. Engage. Got them, sir. Are they secure? Can they beam out to the planet? Negative, sir. They can't leave that ship. I know they can receive us. They can respond with lights if necessary. Unless they've all died and the ship was brought in by automation. Captain. It's the woman in Wyatt's drawings. Captain's log, stardate 41294.6. Orbiting Haven with a Tarellian vessel locked in our tractor beam. Question. What strange combination of circumstances has caused a woman from someone's imagination to appear on the ship? Enterprise to Tarellian vessel. Are you receiving us? My name is Wrenn, and before I enquire why your tractor beam has trapped us here, is there one aboard your vessel named Wyatt? Captain, I don't understand. It's astounding. Ariana was right. He is here, daughter. Wyatt, you've come, just as you promised. How could I be so accurate? Except for the dreams, I've never seen her. Sir, our concern is with the threat your vessel poses to the planet. If you still carry the infection that destroyed your world... We still carry it, Captain. My daughter, I, all eight of us. Eight? All of us that are left. The rest passed on during the years it took to reach Haven. If you've come here because of the legend about planet Haven miraculously healing the sick... We don't ask to make contact with those living below. All we ask is to be... on the edge of some sea, an unpopulated island, a faraway peninsula. This is not our planet, sir. But I will present your needs to those who do govern here. Present the fact that we intend to die here, Captain. And if we die while caged by your tractor beam... so be it. Wyatt, how do you like my new hairstyle? It will look much better when I'm naked. Can we talk about something serious? I'm always serious. Only my pleasant nature makes it seem otherwise. Please, Mrs. Troi. Yes, that was puzzling. A woman from another place who insists she knows you. And... Who you've dreamed of for years. I was hoping that you... Fascinating, Wyatt, how easily your thoughts come through. The answer to the puzzle of Ariana and you is so simple, it's too simple for most humans. Too simple? It's something they know instinctively, but try to reject or build complicated superstitions about. All life, Wyatt, all consciousness is indissolubly bound together. Indeed, it's all part of the same thing. Yes, I have wondered if something like that... That weren't so. And no doubt so has Ariana, which helped you two to make contact. Wyatt, tell me something seriously. Which of these would look best on me naked? Wyatt? Are you feeling alright? Just wedding nerves. I'll take the supplies to the transporter room. I'll notify the Captain they're ready. Look at your father. He can't wait to strip off his clothes for that barbaric ceremony. Please take care of each other. You are beautiful. But you looked the best of all in the desert on the holodeck when we did this. You can put the supplies on the pad. Dr Crusher had me set the coordinates. All we need is the Captain's order. Captain, someone's transporting over to the Tarellian ship. Override. I can't, sir, it's too late. Hello, Wyatt. We always thought you were a dream. You're not surprised? Did you know I'd beam over? Once we saw you were real... we knew. You are a doctor? Yes. I've brought medicines and supplies. And I knew you would be this brave. How could you let this happen? My son, surrounded by those lepers. If I could've prevented it, I would. Beam him back. He can never come back, Mrs. Miller. You may turn off your tractor beam, Captain. We will not be going to Haven. We have... what we really came for. Wyatt? Mother. Mother... forgive me, but I must... I'm going to try to continue the work to cure these people. And Wyatt will do it. I've believed that all along. I knew I was coming to Haven to meet my destiny. I thought it was to be with you, Deanna. It was Ariana who drew me here. I'm sorry. Wyatt... I'm happy for you, and for Ariana too. You've done very well for a human, Wyatt. Mother. Captain... my respects. And mine, sir. Goodbye. Keep the chest. You'll have use for it someday. Shame to waste the trip. Perhaps I should stay and join with a new mate. What? Well, the Captain's highly attracted to me, but he's a little too old. Perhaps I should choose... you. He has other obligations, Mother. Very well. It's his loss. Mr. Homn. Thank you for the drinks. Try and remember your heritage, little one. Captain... even Xelo never had such thoughts about me. You may energize. That was meant as a joke, Captain. I was not amused. Take us out of here, Mr. Riker. Aye, sir. Warp two, helm. Heading 57. Mark 319. Our destiny is elsewhere. But I'm happy that yours is with us, Counselor. Warp two, sir. Heading 57, mark 319. Engage. "
S1E12,"First Officer's log, stardate 41997.7. We are about to make a brief but necessary contact with the Jarada, a reclusive, insect-like race known for its idiosyncratic attitude toward protocol. They demand a precise greeting, in this case from Capt Picard. Their language is most unusual. The slightest mispronunciation is regarded as an insult. Unless it's followed by... The double bars indicate an elongated S sound. And the inverted T means to hold the Z. Unless...? Unless it's followed by three wavy lines, in which case the Z becomes a B. Exactly! What a language! But you spell knife with a K. I spell knife with an N. But, then, I never could spell. Well, this is an insect mind, sir. My mind is barely working. Take a break. No, I want to go over this again. You could be over-preparing. You've been looking forward to the upgrade of the holodeck. You have the time. Captain, you need the diversion. Dixon Hill. The program's installed and waiting. Program desired location. Earth, United States, San Francisco, California. Time period? 1941. AD. File or access code? Dixon Hill, private detective. Enter when ready. Captain's personal log. I'm entering the holodeck, where images of reality can be created by our computer. Highly useful in crew training, highly enjoyable when used for games and recreation. Very funny, Dix. What, did you lose another bet? I'm sorry, I don't understand. The bellboy suit. Are you moonlighting at the Fairmont? The uniform? It's inappropriate. I should've changed. Detective Bell, your cop friend, McNary's partner, was nosing around. If he'd seen you in those threads, he'd have sent you to the funny farm. Mr. Leech called twice and there's a Mrs. Bradley in the office. Nice legs. Not you, her! Got a hot date with my fella. See you in the morning. I lost a bet. Well... ...at least you're ready for Halloween. Halloween? I need your help, Mr. Hill. Someone is trying to kill me. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. The holodeck's amazing new creation is the fictional world of Dixon Hill, the 20th-century detective who's been my hero since childhood. The characters are generated by the computer, yet they feel real, they seem real in every way. I'm not sure who wants me dead. My husband, my stepdaughter... Or a lover, perhaps? Perhaps. Or perhaps it's Cyrus Redblock. I need you to find out. Name your fee. 20 dollars a day, plus expenses. Agreed. I haven't said ""yes"" yet. You'll say yes, Mr. Hill. If it is Redblock, he must think I've got what he's looking for. But, believe me, I don't. I'll take your word for it. Here's a C-note... in advance. Consider it a retainer. And next time... ...wear a suit. Au revoir. Remarkable! Exit. You'll have to call again. I'm just leaving. I'm er... not dressed properly. I'll be back. Mr. Hill? Where are you? Memory, save current setting. Current setting saved. Holodeck off. And... ...when I looked down into the street, I actually saw... automobiles! Automobiles? An ancient Earth device used primarily for transportation. Also seen as a source of status and virility. Often a prime ingredient in teenage mating rituals. Teenage mating rituals? From that window, I could see an entire... City block. That's right! Sounds! Smells! You make it sound so real. That's how it felt. Incredible! Well, I'm... gonna go again. Only this time, I'm going to dress the part. Why not come with me? Yes, I'd like that. I want to take that 20th-century historian. Who? Whalen? Yes. I bet he knows more about Dixon Hill than I do. Shall I tell him, sir? Invite him, Mr. Data! This is supposed to be a recreational activity. The sense of reality was absolutely incredible! When that woman kissed me, it was so... Exciting? Real! The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the Jaradan rendezvous. Mr. Riker, will you go ahead with the briefing? This is primarily a diplomatic mission. The Jaradan are strategically important to the Federation. Previous attempts failed because they are so easily irritated. A slip in the pronunciation of the greeting caused a 20-year rift. The Captain has to recite the greeting without any mistakes. Simple as that? Yes. If the Captain makes even the slightest error... The Captain is aware of the gravity of the situation, Commander. We are all aware of the tape of the last Federation starship to come into contact with the Jaradan. It demonstrates what happened when that captain offended them. Capt Picard is familiar with that. Should we not rerun it? It's not necessary. Meeting adjourned. Why won't the Captain review all available information? When you've seen the Jaradan react once, you don't need to see it again. This Dixon Hill is a most puzzling character. Not really. He was just a 20th-century Sherlock Holmes. But was his modus operandi not dissimilar? Worth investigating. Indubitably, my dear Data. Indubitably. Computer, request all biographical information on fictional character Dixon Hill. Working. First appeared in pulp magazine ""Amazing Detective Stories,"" copyright 1934 AD. Second appearance in novel ""The Long Dark Tunnel,"" copyright 1936. Request complete text of all stories involving said character. Increase speed. Captain's log, supplemental. The Jaradan rendezvous is still 11 hours away. I am about to re-enter the world of Dixon Hill. This time, properly dressed. An experience like this is more enjoyable when shared, so I've invited our fiction expert, Whalen, to accompany me. Dr Crusher will join us shortly. Ready for San Francisco, Mr. Whalen? More than ready, sir. Well, if it's anything like last time, I'm sure you won't be disappoint... Permission to accompany you. I am totally versed in the genre of the period. Well... shall we? Extra, extra, read all about it. Dix, how's tricks? She's fine. He actually thinks you're Dixon Hill. Say, Mac, I'd like to buy a paper, but I don't have any money. You catch me next time, Dix. Thank you. ""Hitler On The Move."" ""Roosevelt Presses Congress For British Aid."" ""DiMaggio Streak Reaches 37."" DiMaggio, sir. Jolting Joe? The Yankee Clipper. Baseball, sir. It was a national obsession at the time. The streak will eventually reach 56 games. And be snapped by two journeyman hurlers for the Cleveland Indians. Cleveland?! They got no pitchers. What, are you nuts or something? The record will stand till 2026, when a London Kings' shortstop... Dix, what gives with this guy? He's not from around here, is he? No, he's not. He's... from... South America. Yeah. He's got a nice tan. I should have listened to her. She said someone was trying to kill her. Captain, she's a page from a book. That's all she ever was. Well, look what the cat dragged in! Cat? Where the hell did he come from? South America. Can't you tell? Wherever you're from, while you're in my town you keep your nose clean. Tough guy, this time you've really done it. Your goose is cooked but good. I'm sorry about this, Dix. Don't apologize to him! Where were you last night between ten and midnight? That would be a bit hard to explain. Yeah? You'll have plenty of time to come up with something. You're going downtown. For what? For the murder of Jessica Bradley. We found this in her purse. Status report. We're being probed. The Jarada. Most likely, but it's long-range. Can't be certain where it's originating. One could get the feeling they don't trust us. I'm receiving a subspace message from the Jarada. That's not part of the plan. Pipe it through. Enterprise, we speak to you in your language. The time has come for you to honor us in ours. This is Cmdr Riker, First Officer of the Enterprise. You are not captain? No, I'm not. I suggest we commence screen-to-screen communication, so we can see each other. You offend us! We will not show ourselves to a mere subordinate! We await your Captain's greeting with growing unrest. End of communication. Terrific. Find the Captain. He's in the holodeck. Aye, sir. Enter when ready. When ready... When ready... You fill out these forms, you bring the bail money in, until then... Hiya, Doc. What's cooking? I had some trouble getting through. Where's Capt Picard? He's on ice. Pardon? He's being grilled. What is he, a fish? He's being interrogated. They think he committed a murder. Why aren't we all being interrogated? I'll go and help him. No, relax, Doc. He's having the time of his life in there. Why should he have all the fun? Come on, Toots. Let's go. Spill it! I've told you everything I know. Well, you'll have to tell us again! From the top. Very good. I've read all this before. It's absolutely as it should be. La Forge to bridge. Riker here. I can't find the Captain, sir. He's in the holodeck. I'm at the holodeck. Something's gone wrong. What are you saying? I can't communicate with him, access the program or open the doors. Enterprise log, supplemental. First Officer reporting. Due to a breakdown in the holodeck, we can't contact the Captain. Tasha, take over, I'm going to holodeck three. Commander. I've studied all the technical manuals on the holodecks, sir. I think I can help down there. Geordi's equipped to deal with the situation. Your duty's here on the bridge. Will. His mother's missing, too. Come on, Wesley. And you say you never met her before she came to hire you? I've already told you that twice. Yeah? Well, you're gonna have to tell me again. Look, fellas, this is no longer amusing. Easy, Dan! You think you're tough, Hill, but you're nothing! Don't take him too seriously, Dix. His old lady's been giving him a hard time. Actually, I do need to get out of here. I'll see what I can do. Something on your mind? Yeah, but I'm not sure it can be repeated in mixed company. You're a pretty hep-looking broad. Is that good? It ain't bad. You like Tommy Dorsey? I got two tickets for the dance tomorrow night. Have you tried the intercom? Yes. Riker to holodeck. Riker to holodeck! Are you seeing anything? No, sir. What can I do? Not a thing. We have to go through this millimeter by millimeter. Alright. Get it fixed. Easy, Wes. Slow down. If there's an anomaly, you could go past it. OK? OK, Dix, we're cutting you loose. That's welcome news. You better not try to leave town! If I leave town, town leaves with me. I get the feeling your friend doesn't like me. We know you're dealing with Redblock. Take it from a friend, it doesn't help your case. Redblock? I'll keep it in mind. Thank you for helping me. Forget it. Hey, Dix, when are you coming over for supper? The kids'd love to see you. And you love Sharon's cooking. Soon, my friend. For the moment, I have other duties. Blonde or brunette? She's a lady, alright. And her name is Enterprise. Sounds like a working girl to me. I'll stop by with some Scotch and hear all about her. Have a good time? I don't know. Sometimes it almost seemed too real. I must say, you wear it well. I'm glad you could make it. Why, thank you, Mr. Hill. We should get back to the Enterprise. We are on the Enterprise. Yes, of course, so we are. Do we have time to see your office? Yes, of course. Why not? Captain... mind if I join you? Yeah, me too, boss. I'd love to take a gander. The holodeck makes excellent use of finite space. Mr. Hill, you have been avoiding me. It's Felix Leech! It has to be. You know me, sir? I've read about you many times. I'm very sorry, Mr. Leech, but we have to be going. Call again tomorrow. You are being quite rude, Mr. Hill. You haven't even introduced me to your charming companions. That'll have to wait. But we have business. Urgent business. You're not going anywhere. Not until we have a little chat. Bridge to holodeck. We're approaching the Jaradan sector. Any word from the Jaradans? Not a thing, sir. They may be testing us. Seeing if we'll stick to the arrangements. What do we do now, sir? We wait. Everything checks out so far. Crusher believes the trouble may have been caused by the Jaradan probe. If so, it could be very difficult to locate. I am not a man to be toyed with, Mr. Hill. You were hired to locate a certain object. I demand to know what you have done with it. Well... I suppose a few moments longer. I'm afraid I can't help you, Mr. Leech. The game is over. I assure you, this is not a game. Take it from me, Leech, you'll never find it. Now, give me the gun. But... they're not real! Massive internal bleeding. How could this happen?! It'll happen again if you don't cooperate. You struck me! How dare you! You're going to be sorry! I promise you, Redblock isn't going to like this! If we don't get him to sickbay, he will die! Exit! Computer, exit! Data, try the other exit in the hall. Computer, identify exit. There's a malfunction. The computer refuses to identify the exits. I'm losing his pulse! Computer, this is the Captain! Identify exit! Standard orbit, Mr. Worf. Aye, sir. Standard orbit. Riker to holodeck. Nothing yet. We're running out of time! The Jarada will expect the Captain's greeting. You may have to stall 'em. It's no use, it's just not there. Suggestions, Mr. Data? I am at a loss, sir. We are in a holodeck-created building of 1941. The computer refuses to accept voice commands. The controls for the environment are, therefore, not accessible. I could use some light. Good day, Mr. Hill. My name is Cyrus Redblock. I hope you don't mind us dropping in. I see I have no choice. Life is an endless stream of choices. Unfortunately, you have chosen to make my life more difficult. I don't suppose you'd be foolish enough to hide it here. I... don't suppose so. Still... I'm sure you won't mind if we take a look around. I wish you'd quit asking, you'll do it anyway. It's a waste of time. Good manners, madam, are never a waste of time. Civility, gentlemen, always civility. Get that stiff out of here. He's not dead! From his pallor, he soon will be. You want I should throw him in the garbage, boss? The room next door will be good enough for now. Don't touch him! Which one struck you? It was Hill. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. A Newtonian truism which you have obviously neglected. Dix, you in there? I saw your light, figured you were working late. Guess I was right. Nice company you're keeping, Dix. Forget to take the trash out this morning? I'm a tolerant man... but I do not tolerate disrespect. Your devotion to etiquette is highly admirable, sir. However, your methods leave much to be desired. What have we here? He looks like a ghost. Yeah. Where do you suppose he's from? Where were you hatched, anyway? I was created on a planet... South America. I've been all over the world and I've never seen anything like you. He's not from this world. None of us are. We're from a world... We're from a world of fabulous riches. A world where there are objects far greater than the one you seek. That's ridiculous! You're a private dick. We've met before and you never mentioned any of this. He's right, Dix. That's pretty weak stuff. I wouldn't even buy that guff. I am not Dixon Hill! I just look like Dixon Hill! He speaks the truth, sir. From your point of view, he is only a facsimile, a knock-off, a cheap imitation. Thank you, Mr. Data. Sorry, sir, that did not come out quite the way I intended. Very, very good. What wonderful fiction. Quite entertaining. I admire your skill at trying to obfuscate our sense of reality. It is you who are not real. You are imaginary characters derived from a work of fiction. Fellas! These guys are too smart to fall for that kind of story! I'm afraid you are not real either, Lieutenant. I don't want to hear any more. You're making me crazy! Let me shoot them, Mr. Redblock. Let me kill them, one by one. What an interesting situation. Perhaps we should test this theory by killing one of them. You've already done that. This man is dying. It's all so senseless. Hardly. Senseless killing is immoral... ...but killing for a purpose can be quite often ingenious. Well said, Mr. Redblock. What is our purpose? We... are on a quest for knowledge. We want the item. We don't have it. Shall I kill him? No. Kill the woman. I have the item. At last. I knew it. God, man, what a character you are! Waiting until the last moment. Testing my resolve. Alright, where is it? I'll explain. But first, tell Leech to back off. Put the gun down. But I so much want to kill her. Maybe later. It won't harm us to listen to Mr. Hill. Don't make any deals with that slime, Dix. Alright, let's begin. Make your thoughts fruitful... and your words eloquent. I don't have to tell you, your lady friend's life depends upon it. There is a price. By God, I knew you were a man of my stripe. Alright, what is it? Mr. Whalen's life. You must help us to save him. We can't delay much longer. We'll have to tell them something. Open hailing frequencies. Frequencies open, sir. This is Cmdr Riker. We demand that you... Cut that off! They'll only be satisfied with the Captain. La Forge to bridge? Riker here. We think we have something, sir. I'll let Ensign Crusher explain. The bi-converter interface... Forget explanations! Can you do it? I don't know if I should, sir. If this isn't done correctly the program could abort and everyone inside could vanish. Do you need more time to study it? Whether we do it now or later, the risk is the same. Do it. If we can find a way of getting him to sickbay by fixing our computer... Computer? I don't know that word. An electronic or mechanical apparatus capable of carrying out repetitious or complex mathematical operations at high speed. Computers are used to control, process, perform or store... Enough! Let me kill him. He's really beginning to irritate me. Captain, the exit! That's it, that's the way into our world. Remarkable! Is this a two-way passage? Can one enter your world and return to this one simply by stepping through? Yes. Allow us to help Mr. Whalen and we will return with... the item. You really are a scamp, aren't you? Do you think I'd stay here...? If you were going to go through yourself, that is not possible. One look at you, sir, is proof that anything is possible. Step aside, Mr. Hill. I'd shoot you myself, but I don't want to deprive my assistant of his greatest pleasure. After we're gone, kill them all. Make sure the bodies are never found. You're insane! You think you can kill a cop and get away with it? Why not? I've done it before. Come on. Au revoir and bonne chance, mon ami. Our destiny awaits. Another world! A whole new world of plunder! What is this? What are they doing? They can't do this to me! Don't they know who I am? I'm Cyrus Redblock! With your permission, sir? Permission granted. Data, pick up Whalen. Take him to sickbay. And you, sir? I'll follow. You go now. I wish I could take you with me. Someone has to book this creep. Once a cop, always a cop, I guess. I have to go. So... ...this is the big goodbye. Tell me something, Dix. When you've gone... will this world still exist? Will my wife and kids still be waiting for me at home? I honestly don't know. Goodbye, my friend. Captain! Are you ready, sir? Ready as I'll ever be, Number One. Open hailing frequencies. Open, sir. This is Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. You have honored us with your words of greeting. A new day dawns between us. So... did you have a nice vacation? It was a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to die there. So, Data, how was it? It was raining in the city by the bay. A hard rain. Hard enough to wash the slime... Sorry, sir. Lieutenant, take us out of orbit. Aye, sir. And, Mr. La Forge... Sir? Step on it! "
S1E13,"Captain's log, stardate 41242.4. Our last assignment has taken us into the remote Omicron Theta star system, home of our android crew member, Lt Cmdr Data. Although we're due at an assignment, I have decided to visit Data's home planet for a few hours in the hopes of unraveling the mystery of his beginnings. Sir, we are 20 minutes from Omicron Theta, mark. Stand by for subwarp. Head for standard orbit of planet. I wonder why Data's not here. He said he wanted to be alone. Perhaps this is a bigger moment for him than we thought. What are you doing? Sneezing. Have you got a cold? A cold what? It's a disease Mom said people used to get. But humans still sneeze for other reasons. And I cannot seem to do it right. Why practice sneezing? We're going to your home planet for the first time. Aren't you interested in that? More than interested. Fascinated. One might say agog. But I also find sneezing interesting. Capt Picard wishes to see you on the bridge. Captain, confirming Class-M reading there. But sensors show no life readings. Not even vegetation. Strange. The cruiser that found Data reported farmlands. Want to take her into orbit, Data? No, thank you, sir. Continue on into close parking orbit. Aye, sir. I could say ""home sweet home,"" sir, if I understood how the word ""sweet"" applies. It usually refers to memories. To one's own memories. Do the memories you have include farms, Data? Affirmative. But the colony's principal interest was science. How can you hold the memories of 411 people, if that means every experience, every day of their life? It does not. Unfortunately. It's the knowledge they accumulated. Actually, I am deficient in basic human information. Sneezing, for example. Approaching close parking orbit. Assemble your away party, Commander. This must be exciting for you. I'm tempted to lead the away team, but my First Officer may object. What would Starfleet say? An Earth colony did disappear there. You see? Now in close parking orbit, sir. Mr. Data... welcome home. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. First Officer's log, stardate 4124.5. We have found Data's home to be a completely dead world. Lifeless vegetation, no insects, not even soil bacteria. What is it that could kill everything on an entire planet? Recording signal locked onto the Enterprise, sir. This looks like anything but farmland. Agreed, sir. The soil appears almost completely lifeless. This is the position in the Tripoli log. Recognize anything? The land contours are familiar. Topographically, this is the correct area. This once was rich farmland, I'd say 20 to 30 years ago. I was discovered 26 years ago. I'd say that everything was dead or dying at the time Data was found. I was found 20 meters in that direction, sir. Data, any idea why you were given the colonists' memories? I feel that it was done hurriedly, but I know little more. Here. This is where the cruiser's landing party found the signal device that led them here. And they found me lying there. You were just lying in the open? No identity record, no instructions? Only a layer of dust. What's the first thing you remember? Opening my eyes. Looking into the eyes of the Tripoli landing party. They believed the signal device sensed their presence and activated me. Then this spot was your birthplace. Commander. I think I've got this place figured out. This was very cleverly done to make this look like a natural hollow in the terrain. There are signs it was constructed in a hurry, as if to hide something. Yes. That was it, Geordi. This awakens a memory remnant. The colonists hoped to remain hidden. But their fear of being discovered... ...led to their storing information in me. Yeah! Thought so. No life readings in here either, sir. The colonists' laboratory. Extremely well equipped. Does this stir any memories? Only a vague impression of some of my functions being tested here. Posted by proud parents? It depicts... something that feels familiar, sir. And dangerous. But I have no idea what it represents. And that is all. Except... ...for an impression... ...of this being a Dr Soong's work area. Who? Dr Noonien Soong? He was called that here. But he traveled here under a different name. Dr Soong, my friend, was Earth's foremost robotic scientist. Until he tried to realize Asimov's dream of a positronic brain. A positronic brain. He promised so much. Then, when he failed completely, Dr Soong disappeared. Now we know he went somewhere to try a second time. Data, Geordi, we'll look at this lab. You and Lt Worf reconnoiter the corridors. Aye, sir. Data, it's you. An epidermal mould. To give your exterior the desired finish. Lt Yar to Cmdr Riker. Come in, Lieutenant. Sir, this installation can hold hundreds of people. But all that's here is empty beds. Thank you. Complete your record scans and report back. Cmdr Riker, looks like some sort of storage area. How many more Datas are there? Looks like just two. I mean, that and the real Data. Commander... ...can this be another me? Or possibly my brother? I honestly don't know, Data. He needs assembling. He? Data, we don't know that this can become alive. It is very important for me to know, sir. I never dreamed it was possible that I might find some link... ...with a form like my own. Understood. We'll take it back to the ship with us. Captain's log, stardate 41242.45. Despite having only a few hours to explore Data's home planet, we discovered something which may explain Data's beginnings, if we can properly assemble and communicate with what we've found. Signal from the Captain. They need you at the debriefing. I have been anxious to hear the Chief Engineer's opinion. Do you believe he can be made to function? It includes all the components in your body. Not that we fully understand your construction. We have our top specialists working on its construction. Just one thing. Without disassembling you, of course, if we should need more... If we need to compare this with the way... you're put together... Bringing it here was right, Number One. Data, if your duplicate functions, it may answer a lot of questions. Does it appear to have... ...all your parts? Completely, sir. Will... Will we know how to turn it on? Alright. Legitimate questions need not be asked apologetically. You feel uncomfortable about your duplicate. We feel uncomfortable, too, for no logical reason. If it's awkward to be reminded that Data is a machine, remember that we are merely a different variety of machine. In our case, electrochemical. Let's handle this as we would anything else. Agreed, Captain. Let's begin with you, Data. Well, sir, a good starting point may be why was I given human form? To make it easier for humans to relate to you. Maybe your designer had something else to prove. That human-shaped robots need not be clumsy or limited. You operate as well as we do, Data. Better, in some ways, sir. Look at this. Could be a link to the disappearance of the colonists. It was displayed in the lab. It could be a child's imagination, but several children did similar drawings. Dr Crusher to the Captain. We very much need Mr. Data's help. He's on his way, Doctor. Is the synthomometer reading positive or negative? Press your fingers there. There. It operates almost as a switch. And these small projections? An android alarm clock. Is that amusing? They time how long I remain unconscious. Are you certain about us using these heating devices? I will feel nothing at all. Marvelous. It should be simpler once we see how your circuitry is connected. I won't mention it to anyone. You have my word. If you had an off switch, Doctor... ...would you not keep it secret? I guess I would. Notice the micro-circuitry here. And here. And another fibroid-like connection here. Let's close up. It seemed to go well, thanks to a look inside Mr. Data. But there are no signs of consciousness yet. It certainly is a good match for Data. Do you think so, really? I wonder which was made first. He was. But they found him to be imperfect, and I was made to replace him. You may call me Lore. But I am also troubled by it describing you as imperfect. Human language gives me difficulty, too. It could mean I lack certain abilities he possesses. I wonder. But the point is, whether you and it have the same capabilities. We do, sir. And your referring to him as ""it"" suggests that I, too, fit into the category of a thing. I see your point. My apologies. Gladly accepted, sir. As for Lore's abilities, his syntax and grammar suggests he was given human memories like mine. You have equal strength and mental abilities? I believe so, sir. Which requires that I now ask a very serious question. Since the two of you are so closely related to each other... The answer, sir, is that my loyalty is to you. And Starfleet. Completely. Thank you, Commander. I was certain of that. Helm control is here. The ship's heading is given in degrees. 360 of them in a full circle this way. Then you say ""mark."" On the nose. That separates it from another 360-degree circle this way on a right angle to this one. By ordering a heading so many degrees this way and so many this way, the ship can travel in all three dimensions. The square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle? Is equal to the sum of the square of the other two... ...something. Which I once heard, but never understood. You'll learn more when the Captain approves your being on the bridge. Have I committed an offence? You will find many rules on starships that must be learnt. You're very clever, Wesley. I now have duties to perform. Correct? Were you ever this anxious to please, Data? Never. I judge Lore to be superior in that desire. Because I was designed to be so human, my brother. I enjoy pleasing humans. ""My brother."" That has a nice sound to it, Data. You consider it important to please humans? It's not important? There are many things of importance. Some more than others. Cmdr Riker's hypotenuse question tricked you into showing your knowledge was greater than you were indicating. He didn't seem that clever. I'll be more careful. You tend to underestimate humans. Praising young Wesley on the helm... A child! He has a child's body. But we have found him to be much more. Thank you for that information, too. You do care about how I perform. I pledge to be worthy of your teaching, my brother. Try not to be jealous of my abilities. What information are you requesting? Everything available on a Dr Noonien Soong. Good old often-wrong Soong. A joke, brother. Actually, he was a genius by human standards. But he destroyed his reputation by making wild promises about his positronic brain design. Almost all of which failed. Promises he later proved to be true. Which made you and me possible, brother. Our beloved father! Will I soon have a uniform like that, brother? I got mine after four years at the Academy, three as ensign, Ten or 12 on space duties at lieutenant grade... A system designed to compensate for limited human ability. And you, brother, are beginning to think as a human. You and I are completely different from them. Are you truly satisfied with the knowledge and memory of a few hundred human colonists? Suppose it could reflect thousands? Or millions? Or the knowledge of hundreds of millions of life forms of every kind? How? We will discuss that in time. And will we also discuss, Lore, which of us was constructed first? It would be foolish... ...to underestimate you, brother. Yes, I lied when I said you were made first, but with good reason. Dr Soong made me perfect in his first attempt. But he made me so human, the colonists became envious of me. You lived with the colonists? Until they petitioned Soong to make a more... comfortable, Less... perfect android. In other words, you brother. Haven't you noticed how easily I handle human speech? I use their contractions. For example, I say ""can't"" or ""isn't."" You say ""cannot"" and ""is not."" A very old joke. But you also have trouble with their humor. Am I right? Quite true. I keep trying to be more human, and keep failing. Do you realize... brother... ...I can help you become more human? And do you realize, Lore, that I am obligated to report all this to our ship's Captain? I assumed as much when I began studying you. May I use this to learn more about this vessel and its customs? Use it to describe your time among the colonists, including all you know about what happened to them. I promise a report of great detail and accuracy. Thank you, Lore. I now have duties to perform. Unless you need something more. I have more than I dreamed possible, brother. Captain's log, stardate 41242.5. Thanks to Lore's report, we now know what happened to the colonists. Using a child's drawing, enhanced by Lore's description, our computer constructed the image of a great crystalline entity which feeds on life, insatiably ravenous for the life force in living forms, capable of stripping all life from an entire world. How did Data escape? Or Lore? Lore had been disassembled. He explained it as jealousy from the colonists. Data wasn't yet alive. Data could be left out in no danger from that creature. Whatever happened to the colonists, he'd be found by the first crew to respond to his signal. So Dr Soong left proof that his experiment did work. Captain, how believable do you find that crystal thing? With so little of even our galaxy explored, it is at least possible. Data, are you expecting Lore to come up here? He left your quarters. To go...? My turbo sensors say he went to deck four. Worf? He examined some work tools and fine-grind quadratanium. Which is used in our construction. That compound is no more suspicious than a human looking for an ointment. But I should check it out. You're watching everything he does? Is that the act of a brother? It's the act of a Starfleet officer obeying his Captain. Captain? Speaking strictly as Security Chief, how much can you trust Data now? I trust him completely. But everyone should realize that that was a legitimate security question. Thank you, sir. Lesson number one in becoming more human. You must observe all human customs. Champagne? An ancient ritual practiced when they observe events of importance. My brother, I toast our discovery of each other. May it fill our lives with new meaning. I have some doubts about the value of human customs... in this... My brother! And let us toast, also, Dr Soong... ...who gave me the full richness of human needs and ambitions. A perfect match for my mind, my body. Brother... And let us toast, also... ...the Great Crystal Entity, with whom I learned to communicate. Before Dr Soong disassembled me, I earned its gratitude by revealing the way to the colonists. Imagine its gratitude when I give it the life on this vessel! This is strange, sir. I show Cmdr Data transmitting on a subspace channel. I know Data's been researching Dr Soong's background. Let's be sure. Would you look in on Cmdr Data? Discreetly? Yes, sir. Crystal Entity. Upon arriving here, you can identify me as the machine named Data. End of message. Come in, please. Glad you are here. Lore attacked me. I had to turn him off. Why did he do that, Data? He discovered we have been using sensors to follow what he does. I practiced his facial tic. Do I have it right? I'd suggest you forget imitating him. If you'd said ""we've"" instead of ""we have,"" I might have suspected you were Lore. Yes. I do use language more formally than Lore. Please inform the Captain I will come to report this. Aye, sir. Wes, tell me again how Data said he immobilized Lore. He told me he just turned him off, Mom. Doctor. Question, Mr. Data. Did you not swear me to secrecy about your off switch? A change of mind. If I cannot trust the bridge crew, whom can I? Captain, bogey coming in on a five o'clock tangent. No ID signal, Captain. Main viewer on tangent. Shields up. Yellow alert. Friendly greetings all languages, all frequencies. I can't believe it can overtake us this fast. Beautiful, isn't it? I recognize it, sir. It's the crystal image Lore described. My God! Still no ID, sir. Also no answer to our inquiries. Did you get a direct look? It's like a giant snowflake, but more complex. The entire electromagnetic spectrum is inside it. But I've no idea what it is. Thank you. Data. Anything else that Lore could tell us may be important. Can you control and question him? I must examine him. Captain. Recommend that you do not let him roam the ship freely. Ensign? Wesley is being alert and responsible. Something to be encouraged. Come. You can watch everything I do. Not if I have a choice. Enough! When addressing a senior officer... As his trainer, it's my fault. You will show proper respect. I will accompany you to make certain. With your approval, sir. Be careful of Lore. Good. He is still unconscious. Notice the same twitch, even though he is unconscious? Stay back. We may have problems if he senses someone else is near. I have a few questions to ask you. Lore, it is Data! He senses you. I cannot control him if you stay. I will record what he says. Bring it to the bridge immediately. And you want to be as stupid as them, dear brother? Well, Number One? It was Lore, sir. Same facial twitch. Lying unconscious as Data described. It became violent, apparently sensing Wesley and I... Or is it Lore pretending to be Data and faking it? I asked for Cmdr Riker's report, Acting Ensign Crusher. If you can't accept the limits of that appointment... Captain! Deflector shields holding. Torpedoes and main phasers to ready. Go to red alert, please. Weapons ready, sir. No, Captain, let me talk to it. You didn't say you could do that. Affirmative. Talk to it. Open hailing frequencies. Crystal form, I identify myself as Data. Advising you to stop your attack. The humans here are powerful. Capable of injuring or even destroying you. Now, I call that communicating! Suggest moving fast to confirm what I told it. Permission to use the large transporter in cargo room three to beam up some living pattern. Perhaps a large tree. Which you'll beam to the entity? Correct, Riker. Ship's phasers will then disintegrate it, proving we are dangerous. Make it so. Sir? Do it. Sir, I know this may finish me as Acting Ensign... Shut up, Wesley! Let me know what he does. Aye, sir. ""Shut up, Wesley""?! Doctor... Since I am finished here, may I say... Shut up, Wesley! ...that what I have said would've been listened to if it came from an adult officer! Permission to go to my quarters, sir. Agreed. Doctor, go with him. You're putting me off the bridge? I'm asking you to keep an eye on your son during this. Emergency, close! Now, show me your warrior fierceness! I'll look. But I shouldn't have let you talk me into this. It's Data! He's been hurt. You know how to turn them on. This is very serious! So, just tell me to ""Shut up, Wesley,"" and I will. You're being very unfair, Wes. Data! The crystal thing is outside the ship. Lore is loose on the inside. How badly are you hurt? I will function sufficiently... to stop Lore. Crystal Entity form... ...it's your old friend. Very good. You've understood perfectly so far. Next, I will signal that I'm transporting something out. The deflector shields will turn off for a moment, and if you move in at that time... How sad, dear brother. You make me wish I were an only child. Then why this marvelous gift? The troublesome little man-child. Are you prepared for the death you've earned, little man? If you take one more step towards my son... Motherhood! Back off, or I'll turn your little man into a torch. I promise him exquisite pain unless you obey me, too, brother. Move away, Data. Please! Do you see now the advantages of being completely human? It includes kindness. I give you your life, Doctor. Go home. Quickly. And I may not injure your son at all. I will stay with Wesley. Go! Or he'll be shrieking by the count of five. One, two... ...three... ...four... Thank you for my human qualities, Dr Soong! Wait! A small payment for your son's misdeeds. The transporter! Wesley, now! Lore's gone, sir. Permanently. Doctor, now that Wesley's safe, go to sickbay at once. Captain, the crystal thing has begun to move away. Are you alright? Yes, sir. I'm fine. Get rid of that damn twitch and put on the correct uniform. Yes, Captain. Are you able to return to duty? Yes, sir. Then do so. Let the bridge know all is well here. Aye, sir. It's gone, sir. Without Lore, it couldn't reach us. We're overdue a computer refit. Do you ever wonder if Data is more human or less human than we want? I wish we were all as well balanced, sir. Agreed. "
S1E14,"Captain's log, stardate 41636.9. As feared, our examination of the overdue Federation freighter Odin, disabled by an asteroid collision, revealed no life signs. However three escape pods were missing, suggesting the possibility of survivors. Ready to orbit Angel One. What kind of place is this, Data? A Class-M planet supporting carbon-based flora and fauna, sparsely populated with intelligent life. Similar in technological development to mid-20th century Earth. Kinda like being marooned at home. Assuming any survivors made it this far. It is the closest planet, but to go the distance we did in two days, would've taken the Odin escape pod five months. Five months, six days, 11 hours, two min... Thank you, Data. ...and 57 seconds. Receiving an audio signal from Angel One. Starfleet are adamant we maintain excellent relations with this planet. Mr. Data, is there any other pertinent information before we reply? Angel One evolved into a constitutional oligarchy. It is governed by a parliamentary body of six elected Mistresses, and headed by a female called ""The Elected One."" It sounds like my own planet. Klingons appreciate strong women. How current is this information? A Federation vessel last visited this planet 62 years ago, Captain. Counselor, as this is a female-dominated society, you might wish to make first contact. Thank you, sir. Open hailing frequencies. Hailing frequencies open, sir. This is Counselor Deanna Troi from the USS Enterprise. I am Beata, The Elected One. How may we assist you, Counselor? The Federation has neglected to visit your planet for far too long. With your permission, we would like to correct that oversight. We feel in no way neglected, Counselor. A diplomatic courtesy call is not expected nor required. We also come in search of possible survivors from one of our freighters. A brief visit will be tolerated. They've broken off transmission. Ever feel like you're not really wanted? Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Where're you fellows off to? Skiing in the Denubian Alps. Save us some deep powder. Sure. The holodecks have lots. The away team's ready. Angel One's strategic importance in this area may be vital. Starfleet hopes they may one day join the Federation. We'll do our best to make a good impression. Energize. Captain's log, supplemental. Our away team has beamed down to an unusual matriarchal society where the female is as aggressively dominant as the male was on Earth hundreds of years ago. Here, the female is the hunter, the soldier, larger and stronger than the male, an arrangement considered most sensible and natural. I am Beata, Elected One of Angel One. Representatives of the Enterprise, you wish to petition? We do. We have reason to hope that survivors from a damaged Federation freighter may be marooned on your planet. We are seeking to learn if this is so. Even a world as remote as Angel One has heard of Starfleet. Searching for survivors seems a petty task for one of their vessels. We don't consider even one survivor petty. Is this man implying that we put a lesser value on life than you do? Not at all. Our discovery of the freighter was unexpected. We have a duty to investigate. I see. And if you find any survivors, what then? We would take them with us and reunite them with their families. Are we to take these strangers at their word? Good question. What reason could we have to deceive you? Another good question. Are there survivors from the freighter Odin on your planet? I'm not prepared to answer... yet. See to their comforts. What's going on? You will remain here until summoned. Is this area secure? Can we talk? Yes. No listening devices or anything of a threatening nature. Good. Troi? There was much fear in that room. Paranoia, I'd say. But of what? I cannot say. But their fear was not focused. I sensed they were all not concerned for the same reason. Undoubtedly, there are survivors from the Odin on this planet. I agree, otherwise why would they be so circumspect? As Mistress Beata is so fond of saying, good question. What do we do if they deny there are survivors? Let's not look for problems. Have everyone prepare for a trip into the Neutral Zone as soon as the away team returns. Trouble, Captain? Insurance. Romulan battle cruisers have been detected near one of our border posts. They've requested our assistance as soon as... Report, Mr. Crusher. We finished our ski lesson, sir... and it kinda just happened. On the Enterprise, nothing ""just happens""... What is that smell? Hm. Reminiscent of Night-Blooming throgni, Captain... from home. Quite stimulating, isn't it? No. I don't smell anything. I'm a little congested. The snow. Don't let this ""just happen"" again, Mr. Crusher. Yes, sir. Interesting. An alcohol-based synthetic, artificially reproducing a floral scent. It's called perfume, Data. And the purpose is...? Certain cultures consider perfume an aphrodisiac. I am unfamiliar with that term. An aphrodisiac is something used to stimulate or enhance... ...sexual pleasure. How does stimulation of olfactory nerves affect the enjoyment of sex? The Elected One will see you now. You say you will remove these survivors from our world. Are you ready to give your word on that? We are. You should know that the vote was not unanimous. Some of those among us are suspicious. Yet the majority feel we have to trust you. We do not understand your misgivings, but appreciate your faith in us. Make certain that faith is not misplaced. There are four survivors from the ship you call Odin. All male. Their leader is a man who calls himself Ramsey. If you'll deliver them to us, we'll have them off your planet at once. If they were mine to deliver, I would, without hesitation. Unfortunately, their hiding place eludes us. Hiding place? Why are they in hiding? Because they're fugitives here, and the quicker they're gone, the better. When these men came to us seven years ago, they accepted our hospitality. But they gradually became restive, started making unreasonable demands, went against the natural order. Using our technology, we might be able to find these men. I assumed as much. But be warned, Counselor, these men are dangerous. Sickbay to Capt Picard. Picard here. Wesley and a friend have contracted a respiratory ailment. A respiratory ailment? Is it contained? I hope so. I've isolated the 12 students who were on the field trip. How contagious is it? Still running tests. The key is to figure out how the virus is transmitted. So far, I've ruled out person-to-person contact. Keep at it. Starfleet has important business for us once the away team returns. I don't fancy the idea of my crew being infected. Data, what's the best way to find Ramsey and the other survivors? If we can isolate something unique to the Odin survivors, an element not otherwise found on Angel One, we can utilize the Enterprise scanners. Mr. Data will need access to your library. Our library's far too sophisticated for a man to comprehend. I am an android, Mistress, though anatomically, I am a male. An amusing notion. Maybe you could teach our males something. Trent, see to the android's needs. Bridge to Picard. Go ahead, Lieutenant. The away team requests that we scan the planet's surface for platinum. Have Mr. La Forge break fixed orbit and initiate a search pattern. Aye, Captain. Geordi? Search pattern initiated... now. This was delivered for you. Good. It's for my meeting with Beata. You're not going to wear that? Yes. Part of this mission is diplomatic. I have an audience with a head of state. I will honor her by wearing indigenous apparel. I don't believe this. You're going to parade around like one of them? Why, what is this attitude? On Kabatris, I wore furs to meet with the leaders. On Armus IX, feathers. This objection doesn't have anything to do with Beata being an attractive woman, does it? This is quite unnecessary. I'm fine. You're infected with the virus. In my opinion, you are not able to command this vessel. That is ridiculous. I have an away team down in unfriendly territory, and also have an appointment with several Romulan battle crui... You have an appointment in your cabin. With your bed. Is that an order, Doctor? Yes. I think I may sneeze. A Klingon sneeze? Only kind I know. Lt La Forge... you have command until further notice. Make the proper ship's log entries. Aye, sir. Scanners indicate... a platinum trace. Shall I notify the away team? Make it so. What do you think? Well... I gotta say, it's... kinda sexy. Thank you, Lieutenant. Actually, it feels quite... comfortable. How handsome you look. Thank you. The Enterprise reports a possible location for the survivors. So soon. I'm impressed. I'm suspicious. You don't believe me? Not yet. I hear the words, but not the sincerity. You objected earlier, Ariel. You were in the minority. After seven years, the great ship Enterprise comes to repatriate a small group of insignificant people. Mistress Ariel, I hear the words, but not the sincerity. You should listen more carefully. Excuse me, Mistress. I have matters to attend to elsewhere. With permission, we'd like to begin our search immediately. By all means. But I'm sure Counselor Troi and the others can see to that without you. If I recall, you had a gesture of goodwill for me. That can wait until we've recovered the survivors. Are you suggesting the women in your party cannot accomplish that without a man? Not at all. Lt Yar and Counselor Troi are completely qualified. You're very generous with your praise. Inform them that you will remain here with me. Riker to Lt Yar. This is Yar. For diplomacy, I'll stay with Mistress Beata while you conduct our search. Commander? You have your instructions. Relax. We have much to discuss. Set phasers to stun. I wish they weren't necessary. A justified precaution, Counselor. Mistress Beata observed that Mr. Ramsey and his men are dangerous. Yar to Enterprise. Go ahead. Three to beam to that platinum trace. Coordinates set. Energize. Welcome. I've been expecting you. Picard to bridge. La Forge here. Status report. 82 more cases of the virus, sir. Dr Crusher's converted the holodeck into an isolation ward. And... the away team? Well, no recent contact, sir, but I informed them of our medical situation, and of the growing Romulan threat to our Neutral Zone outpost. Keep me advised. You have the bridge... until Cmdr Riker returns. Engineering reports a computer mal... I'm sorry. I'm getting sick. Half the ship knows that by now. Report to sickbay, Lieutenant. Engineering to bridge. La Forge here. The computer won't accept the climate controls. On my way. With respect, Lieutenant, there are people to do that job now. La Forge to Engineering. Lt Wong knows that system. I'm sure she can resolve all problems. Thanks for the advice. How did you... find me? Actually, it was quite simple. Angel One has no platinum. Enterprise scanners did the rest. Platinum, was it? My wings. I kept them for their sentimental value. Where are the other survivors, Mr. Ramsey? They're nearby. They're packing, since we can't remain here. Seven years on an alien planet, and I sense no anticipation, no excitement at being rescued. What do you think you're rescuing me from? My shipmates and I have taken wives. A few even have children. You can't rescue a man from a place that he calls his home. Why were you so hesitant to tell us about the survivors? Because Ramsey and his men are anarchists. I had to be sure you weren't here to fuel their struggle. I like the way your eyes pick up the color of your tunic. We do not interfere in the domestic affairs of other societies. But you can interact? Of course. Otherwise, how can we learn? Is that why you're here with me tonight? To learn? Yes. About our society? Yes. Well, in our society, it is the men who are the fortunate ones, enjoying all life has to offer... ...while we women devote ourselves to the obligation of making life work. In our society, we share the responsibilities and pleasures. Which is why I am here with you while the women look for Ramsey. Remind me to thank them when they come back for giving us this time. You resist. Don't you find me attractive? Yes, I find you very attractive. You attract me like no man ever has. It's not my function to seduce or be seduced by the leader of another world. It's not the reason. No. But will you still respect me tomorrow? I hope so. Thank you, Trent. You may go. Compliments of the USS Enterprise. It's called an Albeni meditation crystal. Very impressive. Now I must repay you in kind. Five months in a rescue pod no bigger than this room is an eternity I hope none of you will ever have to face. When we finally made it here... ...we thought we'd died and gone to heaven. You've seen the women here. They're tall and strong and very lovely. But after the newness wore off, we saw how the men were treated. There's no votes. There's no opinions. There's no respect. None of which is your concern any longer, Mr. Ramsey. Call the others in, please. It's time to leave. Despite their problems, we like it here on Angel One. We're not going anywhere. But Mistress Beata... Be damned. Her wish is not my command, and neither is yours. You can't force us to go. Mr. Ramsey is correct. The Odin was not a starship, so her crew is not bound by the Prime Directive. If he and the others wish to stay here, there is nothing we can do. Bridge to sickbay. How are you doing, Doctor? We have more sick than we do beds. So far I've had to confine over 300 to their private quarters. We're going to be badly undermanned if we engage the Romulans in battle. The Romulans are your problem, Lieutenant. Finding an inoculant is mine. This virus mutates every 20 minutes. But we haven't had any fatalities... yet. If this continues, there'll be no one to run the ship. If this continues, Lt La Forge, nobody will be healthy enough to care. Yar to Enterprise. Enterprise here. Go ahead. Prepare to beam three to our previous location. After re-grouping with Cmdr Riker, we'll return to the ship. Make that on the double. We have a medical emergency brewing here. One third of the crew is down, and word from the Neutral Zone is more Romulan vessels are converging there. I'll inform the Commander. Yar out. One thing before we go. You said you were expecting us. Why? I can't answer that. We wish you well, Mr. Ramsey. Energize. They're gone. How refreshing, to be with a man who knows what he wants. And doesn't have to be told by a woman? Exactly. I knew you were bright enough to understand. See, women, by our very nature, want only what is best for their men. Men are not objects to be possessed, Mistress Beata. Of course they're not. It was merely a figure of speech. Enter. What is so important that you intrude upon my privacy? They have returned, Mistress, but without Ramsey or the others. Your advanced technology has proven inadequate? What happened? Mr. Ramsey and the other survivors refused to leave. You gave me your solemn word. I'm sorry, there's nothing else we can do. I'm sorry as well. Since you refuse to take them with you... ...I am left with no choice but to sentence them all to death. Come. It looks horrible... tastes worse, but it's absolutely guaranteed to make you feel better. I knew you'd like it. Are you wearing cologne? Like something I smelled earlier, something... Klingon. Lt Worf and I... detected the same scent... when we bumped into your son... at the holodeck. It's that smell. That's how the virus travels. An airborne particle whose sweet scent inspires deep inhalation. And once inside the body, it becomes that damn virus. I have work to do. You are excused, Doctor. What's the latest on the medical situation? Dr Crusher feels the virus will run unchecked through the entire ship. Attempts to develop an inoculant have ended in failure. Lt La Forge still has bridge command, pending your return, sir. And the Romulans entering the Neutral Zone? The outpost reports seven Romulan battle cruisers within sensor range. The USS Berlin answered the distress call. However, if hostilities erupt, the outpost and the starship will be out-gunned. They feel the Enterprise's presence will be a vital show of force. Some show of force. The Enterprise could fly on autopilot, but with that virus around, we'll be in sorry shape if things turn ugly. It's time we leave. It doesn't feel right with Beata determined to execute those people. She has to find them first. They've been fugitives for years. They must be good at evading capture. Something's wrong. Before you go back to your ship, there's something I want you to see. We were no harm to anyone. Why did you tell them where we were? You brought this upon yourself... you and the traitor. One does not need technology to follow Mistress Ariel sneaking out to warn her husband. Let her stand with him now. For tomorrow, they will die together. Your ""advanced society"" uses executions to suppress those who reject your views? I don't expect you to understand. Why, because I'm only a man? You'll accomplish nothing with that attitude. Mistress Beata... ...if you had an alternative to executing Ramsey and his followers, would you take it? Is that not the way of an advanced society? Then let us meet with them one last time. Let me try to convince them to leave with us. Will you include others here who choose to follow Ramsey and his group? Yes, all of them. Mistress Beata is willing to give you a second chance. We're prepared to take your entire group with us. That's very kind of you. But we're not going. Haven't you been paying attention, Ramsey? You're scheduled to be executed tomorrow. We don't want to die. We don't want to leave either. There's no time to debate the issues. You're leaving, like it or not. Excuse me, Commander, but removing these people against their will would violate several regulations, including the Prime Directive. I realize that, Mr. Data. I'd rather face a court-martial than live with the guilt of leaving these people to their death. Cmdr Riker to the Enterprise. Enterprise. Crusher here. Must be worse there than we thought. Doctor, where's Lt La Forge? He's right here, but he's in bad shape. Notify the transporter room I have 14 to beam up. I can't allow it. This virus is totally out of control here. Doctor, these people are facing their deaths down here. They might be facing the same here. Until I have a better idea of what this is, no one beams up. I'm sorry, Will, but you must wait. Understood. Doctor, would this virus have any effect on Mr. Data? Not likely. You're going back there alone. Get the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone before it's too late. This is Data, standing by to beam up. What of them? I don't know. Mistress Beata invites you to witness this morning's reaffirmation of Angel One's moral imperative. Is that the civilized word for murder on this world? You send Mistress Beata our regrets. The Elected One will not... Enterprise to Cmdr Riker. They're still here. Riker here. I said to go to the Neutral Zone immediately. Explain the delay. Actually, sir, you ordered me to reach the Neutral Zone before it is too late. After relieving Lt La Forge, I computed the length of time the outpost and the USS Berlin can withstand a Romulan attack, and deducted our time to destination at maximum warp speed. That leaves Dr Crusher 48 minutes to develop an inoculant to the virus. So we still have time to act. 48 minutes. 47, sir. Perhaps, Data, perhaps. Thank you for following my orders so precisely. On second thought, Trent, we would be honored to witness your moral imperative in action. We have determined that the heretical teachings of Ramsey and his followers are inconsistent with harmonious life on Angel One. Our patient efforts to silence revolutionary voices have failed. Therefore, we are left with none but the most final alternative. As you can see, we are not without compassion. Your deaths will be swift and painless. Mistress Beata, before we see living examples of your compassion, may I speak? Is this a plea for leniency? Nothing of the sort. As the governing body here, you're entitled to execute your laws, or your citizens, as you see fit. Make your point so we can proceed with this unpleasant business. When you spoke of the prisoners, you used the term revolutionary. Indeed, death has been known to stop revolutions. But I suspect it's not a revolution that Angel One is hoping to stop. It's evolution. Mr. Ramsey and the Odin survivors did not initiate the waves of dissent rippling through your planet. Their presence here merely reinforced the change in attitudes between men and women that was already under way. They became symbols around whom those with similar views gathered. You may eliminate the symbols, but that does not mean death to the issues those symbols represent. No power in the universe can hope to stop the force of evolution. Be warned. The execution of Mr. Ramsey and his followers may elevate them to the status of martyrs. Martyrs cannot be silenced. Stop. We will adjourn to consider your words. Thank you. I don't know if it was enough. Sickbay to Bridge. Go ahead, Doctor. Bingo, Data. Bingo? I fail to see the relevance, Doctor. Is that not an ancient Earth game? It's also a reference to success. I've got the inoculant. Excellent, Doctor. We still have 17 minutes left. I will inform the away team immediately. Enterprise to Riker. We are now ready to beam you up, Commander. Data, Ramsey and the prisoners are with us in the Great Hall. Lock in the transporter. Prepare to evacuate the entire group. But for now, stand by. Understood, Commander. On consideration, this legislature has voted to stay the execution. Their children will be returned immediately. Do not rejoice prematurely. Ramsey and his followers are to be exiled to a distant and unpopulated region. Life will be difficult there, with little time for revolutionary... or evolutionary upheaval. As some observed, we may not be able to stop evolution, but perhaps we can reduce it to a slow crawl. For a man, you can be very clever, Cmdr Riker. Riker to Enterprise. Belay my previous order, Mr. Data. There will now be only three to beam up. Energize. Welcome home. It's good to be back. Are they recovering? Slowly, but yes. And the Captain? The Captain is fine, thank you. Mr. Data has been briefing me on the away team's comportment, Number One. We... improvised, sir. I look forward to your reports. Time to pay the Romulans a call? Set course for the Neutral Zone. Warp six. Coordinates set. Warp six. On your mark, sir. Sir? Engage. "
S1E15,"Captain's log, stardate 41365.9. The Enterprise has been ordered to Starbase 74, in orbit around Tarsas III. A routine maintenance check will be made and certain upgrades done, including the holodeck, which has had problems. I anticipate a glowing report. The ship performs magnificently, beyond expectations. Coming into position. Stand by to dock. Ready to dock, sir. Engage mooring beams. And lock off. Aye, sir. And... docking complete. Thank you, Number One. Well done. And... ...well done, all. Starbase maintenance approaching airlock five. Cmdr Quinteros. Permission to board? Granted. Welcome. Captain. Cmdr Riker. You're late. We expected you a week ago. We were delayed at Omicron Pascal. Any specific you wish to report? No, we're very pleased with the Enterprise. I knew you would be. I headed the team that built her. Are these gentlemen the Bynars? They're not gentlemen. Or ladies. They're a unified pair. They're always together. This is One Zero. And this is Zero One. They upgraded the computers on the Wellington. A great job. Your reputation precedes you. I'm pleased to have you. A pleasure to work on such a computer. You have 48 hours. In 48 plus six we must leave for Pelleus V. I thought we had more time. Sorry. We can't delay. You could postpone the work. No. We can complete our work within the time allotted. They work very quickly, but it'll be tight. Cmdr Riker and I will stay on board. We won't need you until we're ready for inspection. The Bynars seem perfect for this. It's the first time I've met them. They have become so interconnected with their planet's master computer that their language and thought patterns are as close to binary as it's possible for organic beings. I wonder how they'll improve a computer as advanced as ours. Bridge. Well, I have work to finish, then I'm going to put my feet up, turn on my relaxation light and lose myself in the pages of an old novel. And you? You've earned a rest. I'm not good at organizing my time off. Something will turn up. It always does. I'll be in my ready room. And, Number One... good work. I thought there'd only be two of you. Because of the limited time, we need others. Is there a problem? No! No problem. Then why are you so excited? Because we must... Stacking! To reconfigure the computer. To communicate with itself more efficiently and faster. You act like you don't believe them. I'm not sure that I do. Maybe it's nothing. Perhaps it's how their species behaves. Maybe. I'm going to stroll around the ship. You got the bridge. Keep your eye on them. Yes, sir. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. We've been challenged to a game of parrises squares by Maintenance. Want to join us on the starbase? You have a full team. We can switch off. You'll lose the rhythm of the game. I can't persuade you? No, but win. For the Enterprise. Rest assured, we will be victorious. Whatever the cost. Worf, it's just a friendly game. Work up a sweat, have a few laughs, make new friends. If winning is not important, then, Commander, why keep score? I think he's pulling your leg. Believe it or not, Worf is developing a sense of humor. I hope so, for their sake. Good luck. Computer, there's a power reduction in section L-94. Explain. Unoccupied sections are being closed down to clear space in the main computer banks. It is necessary to facilitate the system upgrade. Full power can be restored if needed. Well, what do you think? Tell me what it's supposed to be. It is an attempt at pure creativity. We're investigating if Data can be creative. And this... is my attempt, with guidance from Geordi. I suggested the zylo eggs. Is that what those are? Keep notes. This project may be of interest to future scholars. Really? A blind man teaching an android to paint. That's gotta be worth a couple of pages in somebody's book. Are you packing to leave for ever? Cmdr Riker. No, I'm just gathering my notes. Professor Terence Epstein is at the starbase. Is that someone I should know of? He's the leading mind in cybernetics. He lectured at my medical school. You know the disaster at Micromius? Since then I've been working on an approach that combines cybernetics and regeneration. Sounds impossible, I know, but I've found an approach that will work. What an opportunity! To have a chance to talk with Dr Epstein. Sorry, Will, I'd love to chat but I have to go. How's it going? Almost done. The deviation caused by a probe is corrected. You may use it any time you wish. How much has changed? What exactly did you do? Enhancement. Nothing more. Do you wish to try the enhancement? Alright. What should I choose? Computer, I'd like someplace to play music. With atmosphere. Specify. Jazz. Era? Circa 1958. Location? Kansas City. No. New Orleans. Bourbon Street bar in New Orleans. Around 2 AM. Program complete. Enter when ready. Very good. Very good indeed. Now, I'll need someone to play with. A trio. Piano, bass, drums. And a 'bone for me. Now, an audience. Too many. I was thinking of something... a little more intimate. Great job, boys. But, computer, blondes and jazz seldom go together. Now, that is truly exceptional. But more sultry. Gentlemen, if this is what you call enhancement... ...you have a gift for understatement. What's your name? Tell me you love jazz. My name is Minuet, and I love all jazz except Dixieland. Why not Dixieland? You can't dance to it. My girl! What's a knockout like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Waiting for you. Waiting for me? You can't be serious. Yes, Will. I've never been more serious in my life. Can I ask you a question about the Bynars? Why not just ask them? What is that high-pitched sound you make? It's our primary language. How do you process data so fast? We store information with these. We receive it all the time and save it until needed. How did you develop this ability? It happened over a long period of time. A society intermixed with computers has great advantages. And a few disadvantages. Everything under control? Fine, sir. I was trying to find out about the Bynars. Where's Cmdr Riker? On holodeck four. Shall I call him? No, I'll go down there myself. Keep me apprised. Yes, sir. Man, the chick digs you. What makes you say that? Look at her. Maybe it's my music. Well, don't give up your day job. Too real! You got that straight, Slim. Too real is too right. Thanks for letting me sit in. Ain't nothing to it. I have to leave for a while to see to my duties. Your work's very important to you. It is me. It's what I am. Can we dance once before you leave? Sure. Why not? How did you learn to dance so well? From following you. I can anticipate your lead. So, tell me about your work. What is it about it that consumes and enthralls you? Interesting choice of words. That's exactly what it does. You're very fortunate. I know that. To be exactly where you want to be. And it's great that you realize it. I'd be a fool not to realize how lucky I am... ...to be on this ship, serving with these people. It's like a dream come true. Just like this. A dream? Is that what this is? Is that what I am? I know you're a computer-generated image, but... ...your smell... ...your touch, the way you feel. Even the things you say and think seem so real. Thank you. How far can this relationship go? I mean, how real are you? As real as you need me to be. Astounding. Captain. Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. It's alright. Come on in. You picked a wonderful locale. This is something I might have chosen myself. Aren't you going to introduce me? Capt Picard, this is Minuet. Minuet, Capt Jean-Luc Picard. Enchantée. Comme c'est merveilleux de vous voir ici. Incroyable. Vous etes Parisienne? Au fond, nous sommes tous Parisiens. Oui, au fond, nous sommes tous Parisiens. The spirit of that city can always enchant my soul. I have been hoping to meet you. Was I the subject of conversation? Indirectly. Come, join us, Jean-Luc. A glass of wine? Thank you. Will was saying how much he enjoys this assignment. It's a credit to you. For a ship and crew to function well, it starts with the captain. You set the tone. At this moment, it is you who are setting the tone. The sophistication of this programming is remarkable. In what way? The holodeck has given us woodlands and ski slopes, figures that fight and fictional characters with whom we can interact. You're very different. You adapt. You spoke in French. It was very simple. When I heard your name, I merely accessed the foreign-language bank. That's very impressive. Oui, mon chou. Now what are you doing? I'm awaiting inspiration. Cmdr Data? This is Cmdr Data. Go ahead. We have possible trouble in Engineering, sir. Can you be specific? I'm afraid not. It's in the magnetic containment field containing the antimatter. Can you come up? We'll go to Engineering as that's where the trouble is. Don't disturb the Captain or Cmdr Riker yet. Aye, sir. Bridge, this is Main Engineering. This is the bridge. Are you running test programs? No. Are the Bynars? Not to my knowledge. Is there a problem? I don't know. There's no one on duty here. We have strange readings from the magnetic containment field. It's deteriorating. Contact the Captain. I'm initiating red alert. I can't maintain the containment field. Engineering to Captain. If the antimatter is released, we'll be destroyed. Nothing I do has any effect. I'm losing it. I've rechecked every circuit. This is not a computer misreading. Computer, situation analysis. Estimate release of antimatter in four minutes, 18 seconds. 17 seconds... 16 seconds... Engineering to bridge. Bridge here. Alert Starbase. Inform them we are abandoning ship. Explain why. Initiate automated departure sequence. Set course and speed to keep maximum distance from any inhabited planets. Shouldn't we wait for the Captain? We've no time. Based on all present information, the decision is correct. This is Lt Cmdr Data speaking for the Captain. Abandon ship. This is not a drill. All personnel, this is not a drill. I say again, abandon ship. All personnel, this is not a drill. Abandon ship. Decks two through four to cargo transporters. Decks five through ten, proceed to transporters one, two, three and four. Decks six through 16, proceed to transporters five, six, seven, eight, nine... Hold your positions, please. Prepare to energize. And energize. Decks 29 through 42, proceed to transporters 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20. This is not a drill. What's going on? Please, stand out of the way. The ship is being evacuated. Why? Some problem in Engineering. Get a Security team together. Ship's log, supplemental. This is Lt Cmdr Data. I have put the ship on automated departure and ordered evacuation of the Enterprise. Everyone remaining is leaving on foot or beaming off. Computer, where are the Captain and Cmdr Riker? All decks empty. Curious. The Captain is usually last to leave. Let's go. We've only got 41 seconds. I think we're the last. I hope we are. Did you see the Captain and Riker? No. Are they not on Starbase? No. They're still on the Enterprise? Yes. Sir, where is your transporter room? We must beam back for them. You haven't time. Starbase 74. The Enterprise magnetic field is regenerating. Wait. How is that possible? That changes nothing! The Captain and Cmdr Riker are in trouble or they'd be here. Look! Your ship is almost clear. And the boy never found out? Yes, but not until he came back in with his little sister. I bet they were all smiles. Yes, but they'd been found out. You handled that in a very thoughtful way. You're good with people. Don't you agree, Jean-Luc? She's very different from the other images we've met on the holodeck. She's more intuitive. It's as though she's been plugged into my subconscious. She knows what I want her to say before I'm aware of it myself. An understandable progression. Computers make decisions based on input. We humans give off a multitude of subtle signs that... ...that communicate our emotions. It's uncanny. I could develop feelings for Minuet exactly as I would for any woman. Doesn't love always begin with the illusion more real than the woman? Jean-Luc, spoken like a true Frenchman. Well, I think I'll be leaving. Don't go! Two's company. We have time. There's no rush. I'd really like it if you'd stay. Yes, Captain, stay. This is your diversion, not mine. Wait! We haven't danced. I don't dance. Then more wine. No, thank you. Wait. Please don't go. You can't. Not yet. What's wrong? Why can't he leave? Exit! Captain to bridge. Situation report. Riker to bridge. Computer, explain red alert. A programmed response. The magnetic field containing the antimatter had weakened. Why wasn't I notified? Unknown. Present condition? Magnetic field restored. Containment restored. Propulsion at maximum efficiency. Locate Data. Not on board the Enterprise. Explain. All personnel except the Captain and First Officer have been evacuated. Evacuated? Was it that critical? Yes. Are we still at the starbase? No. Position report. Coordinates 4159.26 by 81921 by 312. Heading 233, mark 45. Destination? Planet Bynaus in the Beta Magellan system. The Bynars. Have the Bynars stolen the Enterprise? That information is not available. It's the Bynars. You're part of this. Yes. You were the lure to keep me here. Yes. When they saw your interest in me they thought I could distract you. That's Riker. What about me? That was a fortunate happenstance. What do they want with me? Or the Enterprise? I'm not programmed to tell you that. Come on, Number One. We've got to regain control of our ship. OK, so what do we do? Which is the nearest vessel? The Trieste. I know it. Too small, too slow. Plus, it's 66 hours away. Where are the Bynars? I haven't seen them. Then they are still aboard. We must send a vessel to intercept them at Bynaus. They may head for there. What makes you think so? It is the best place for us to start. Picard. Access. Captain's log, supplemental. We now know who has commandeered the Enterprise. The Bynars. We can't contact the bridge. Cmdr Riker and I will now try to regain control of our ship. This way. To Engineering? Our first step. Verify containment and initiate auto-destruct. Initiate auto-destruct? Our ship has been commandeered by a force of unknown size and intent. We're here alone. We must assume the worst. If we don't regain control, no one else must have it either. This is the one decision that requires us to be in total agreement. The time allotted concerns me. There's no option. A five-minute countdown. Sufficient to get to the bridge and shut off auto-destruct. Or not. This vessel must not fall into hostile hands. Then let's set it and go. Recognize Picard, Jean-Luc, Captain. Recognize Riker, William T, Commander. Set auto-destruct sequence. Does the First Officer concur? Yes. Set auto-destruct sequence, now. Auto-destruct will detonate in four minutes and 59 seconds. The only place to stop this is on the bridge. Let's go. What do you make of this, sir? A huge amount of data is being stored in the computer. Just stored. Why? Another piece of this puzzle. Bridge access denied. They locked it. We need another way in. One of us could beam in. It takes too long to materialize. You'd have no chance. I could beam into the turbolift, force the doors. No, we'll beam in simultaneously, to different areas of the bridge. With luck, one of us will be a distraction. There's only four minutes left. Still no response from the Enterprise. They would answer if they could. Someone else has control. Do you think I am responsible? Responsible? How could you possibly have known? My station is on the bridge. You can't be there every second. You are wrong, Geordi. I can. I do not need rest or diversion. I should not have been painting. I was negligent. It's a pointless discussion. You could have been there and it still might have happened. Cmdr Quinteros. You have three ships in here. We need one of them now. We're rushing repairs. But it's 18 hours before one will be ready. There's nothing you can do. Set coordinates for bridge - port for me, aft for you. You're on pad two. I've set a ten-second delay. Set phasers on stun. Number One, good luck. Over here, Captain. Why did you steal my ship? Please... ...try... to... ...help... us. Cancel auto-destruct. Does the First Officer agree? Affirmative. Auto-destruct cancelled. We're in orbit around Bynaus. How are they? They appear dead. Let's see if we can get some answers from Bynaus. Their main computer is off. Sensors show all their equipment is inert. They can neither send nor receive messages. They depend on their computer. Are they functioning? They're probably like these Bynars here. Dying. Why did they steal our ship? What is their purpose? They cleared computer space. Let's see what they stored. Captain, it's enormous. Every byte of free space is filled. They must have made a core-dump from their world into our computer. I can't get in. I wish they'd left a note. Maybe they did. Minuet. What's this all about? A star in the Bynar system went supernova and they miscalculated. The pulse from the explosion was going to knock out their computer. So they had to transfer their stored information and shut down until it passed. And then reactivate their system and transfer the information back. We have the only mobile computer large enough. So what went wrong? Why are they dying? The star went supernova before it was expected. You were late arriving at Starbase 74. Why didn't they say something? Why didn't they just ask for help? I don't know. I don't have those answers. Is there anything we can do? Yes, return the data stored on your computer back to Bynaus. How? You don't know? Yes. If I had the filename, but we don't. Do you? I don't know what you mean. They wouldn't intentionally hide it, make it hard to find. It must be right in front of us. Let's contact Starbase 74. They're dying. They meant you no harm. It was their world they were trying to save. Help them, Will. Hurry. Please. Starbase 74, this is the Enterprise. Do you read me? This is Starbase 74. What is your situation? We'll go into that later. I must speak to Lt Cmdr Data. I'm here, sir. The Bynars have stored some material in our computer. We need to access it. Access is available by code or password. I know that, Data, but what could it be? Filenames can be anything, sir. They want us to find it. It would be simple. Then a name. Or a place. It could be something personal. In this case, in binary language, which is ones and zeros in groups of eight or 16. Would they have kept it that simple? Try it. Picard out. That's the file. Access the file. Start the transfer. So much for that idea. Let me take the other position. The Bynars always work in pairs. Maybe that is required. It appears to be successful. Their system's started up. A resident diagnostic program is running. Their system is absolutely incredible. Our world is reactivated. Our people express their gratitude. We will return to your starbase for whatever punishment your system requires of us. Why didn't you just ask for help? You might have said no. There was a good chance we'd say yes. Our need was too great to risk rejection. And so you stole it. Their reason was part of the binary thinking. For them, there are only two choices. One or zero. Yes or no. Why lure me to the holodeck? Because we knew we might die. We needed someone to restore our computer. And you did. No one has been hurt. You have your planet back in order. We have our ship. Well... it's been some time since I had the conn. But not to worry, Number One, you're in good hands. Starbase 74... ...warp two. Engage. Everything's under control. USS Enterprise has cleared the starbase perimeter. Is everything alright? All in order. But I want a complete check, all systems, all divisions. What about the Bynars? There will be a hearing. We knew that would happen. Follow me, please. Permission to leave the bridge, sir? Permission granted. What is a knockout like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint? You're not Minuet. She's gone. I tried variations of the program, others appeared, but... not Minuet. Maybe it was all part of the Bynars' programming. But you know, Number One... some relationships just can't work. Yes, probably true. She'll be difficult to forget. "
S1E16,"Captain's log, stardate 41309.5. We are orbiting Persephone V, where I have been sent to confer with Admiral Mark Jameson in regard to an extraordinary situation. Starfleet received this subspace transmission two days ago, Admiral. Let's see it, Captain. On viewer. I am Karnas, Governor of Mordan IV. A dissident group of terrorists have taken Federation Ambassador Hawkins and his staff hostage. They will not discuss terms with me. This is a crisis I cannot resolve. The terrorists are demanding a Federation negotiator. I feel there is only one negotiator with the skills to resolve the situation. The lives of the hostages depends on Starfleet bringing this man here. Cmdr Mark Jameson. Admiral Jameson. The terrorists have given you six Earth days to deliver him, or the hostages will die. Starfleet cannot understand why this crisis has developed. Mordan IV has finally gained peace after decades of civil war. 40 years of civil war, Captain. Yes, sir. Karnas was largely responsible for the planet's unification and peace. Why should he now be unable to deal with this rebellious faction? 45 years ago I negotiated a hostage situation on Mordan, Captain. Karnas was a young man then... but so was I. He seems to feel that I can handle things again. I'm to take you to Mordan IV as soon as you're ready, Admiral. My wife and I will beam aboard at 1500 hours, Captain. Acknowledge. Received and acknowledged, sir. Picard out. Nearly 1,500 now, sir. Well, Number One, let's go and welcome the Admiral aboard. Welcome aboard, Admiral. This is my Executive Officer, Cmdr Riker. My pleasure, sir. Ma'am. My wife, Anne. Captain, there are certain details of this mission you should understand before we begin. Yes, sir. I am not just an adviser. On any assignment I accompany, Starfleet has designated me Senior Mission Officer. I control the away team and all its actions. Is that understood? Of course, Captain, you command the ship, but the mission is mine. I trust you are in full agreement? Yes, sir. Of course. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Message coming in from Mordan, sir. Put it on the screen, Mr. Data. Mordan IV to Enterprise. This is Karnas. I will speak to the Captain. I am Capt Picard, commanding the Enterprise. Is Admiral Jameson on board? He's here, beside my First Officer. Do you wish to speak to him now? So, Jameson, I see time has not been kind. It seldom is, Karnas. But we could save a good deal of it, if you'll outline the terrorists' demands. They insist all discussions will take place here on Mordan. They refuse to speak to me, only to a Federation mediator. They say they will brook no excuses. If there are any offered, the hostages will die... unpleasantly. I believe them. So should you, Admiral. Tell them... I accept the conditions of negotiation. I will do so immediately. He doesn't seem to know much about the situation. Wrong, Number One. He told me that the terrorists are desperate enough to kill if crossed. They are willing to talk, one on one, but not to him. Counselor? From his body language, as well as his words and tone, I'd judge that what Karnas said was honest. But I sensed a holding back. Perhaps he knows more about them than he's prepared to admit. Possible, but I suspect it's closer to the mark if we said he doesn't want to admit failure of his own efforts to negotiate. He is a proud man. That could be. Karnas has established himself as a powerful man on Mordan. Suddenly, in this situation, his power is useless. Sickbay to bridge. I'm ready for Admiral Jameson now. In a few moments, Doctor. Ready for what, Captain? It's just a routine medical checkup. Ship's regulations. I don't understand how Karnas knew that you were still... available. Still alive, you mean? You could've been dead. Quite right, Commander, but I am not, and I imagine Ambassador Hawkins has told him that. I briefed the Ambassador about Mordan before he took up residence. Karnas has a problem he thinks you can resolve. What do the terrorists need that Karnas can't, or won't, give them? Mordan's had peace for five years. They're finally at a state of productivity which satisfies their planetary needs, but no more than that. Perhaps the dissidents feel the Federation could provide more. I have negotiated many treaties on many planets. Peace, or the appearance of it, is often a prelude to war. Admiral, are you suggesting the terrorists want arms and weapons? They may. I am suggesting that Karnas is the last man to give them weapons. I see. You believe that Karnas would not negotiate on that point, and so the terrorists demanded an outside negotiator. I know Karnas. He is a warrior. He lives for challenge. These people have insulted his honor by taking the embassy staff hostage. I'll negotiate, but I'll have to be very careful in dealing with Karnas. He'll want revenge for that insult. Well, it's about time. Couldn't get away from the bridge? Didn't want to. Feels good to be on one again. I'm glad, Mark. You want me to help you up? You're stronger today. I'm fine. I feel like a kid again. This ship is magnificent. It even has family quarters. Pity we didn't have them 20-30 years ago. We could have been together almost all of your career. Mark? I'll get sickbay. No. There's no need. It's... happened before. When? You haven't said anything. It'll pass. Just give me a moment. See, I'm... better. It's going away. What is it? Did the doctors know? Just body changes. Last checkup they said I'd have to expect it. You're sure? Don't lie to me. I'm sure. All the medical information the Admiral provided is satisfactory. Excellent, Doctor. Except for one thing. The test results he gave aren't two days old, they're two months old. The medical records coder includes the date within the file number. He lied to me and I don't know why. He is 85 years old. For some, memory starts to fail. He suffers from Iverson's disease. That affects the body, not the mind. No, I have a gut feeling he's hiding something. That is an observation I would expect from Troi. Doctor... I do respect your opinion... ...and I'll want you on the bridge for a few days. The Admiral must remain in the best of health for these negotiations, and he might require your services. Admiral, we're approaching the Idini star cluster. Would you like to take the conn as we make transit? Thank you, Captain. I would. Well, Admiral, quite a little surprise you've pulled on us. Yes, quite. Neglected to mention... I began some new therapy before I... left. Seems to be working. I haven't felt this good since the last time I was in space. All I needed to get me up was the thought of commanding a ship again. Admiral, you only have the conn temporarily. A figure of speech. She's your ship. I'll just keep an eye on her for a while. The Admiral displayed a remarkable improvement. No one recovers from Iverson's disease. There's no cure, and it's never gone into remission. I know of no therapy that would produce such results. How do you account for it? I can't. The Admiral has been confined to his chair for four years now because of Iversons. By all the medical facts we know, he should never have walked again. Look into it, Doctor, thoroughly. Yes, sir. The terrorists have given you six Earth days to deliver him... ...or the hostages will die. I don't know how much more you think you can get from that tape. My God! What's happened? It's the new therapy I'm taking. It's... working, Annie. Darling! I told you I just needed to get back in space again. You really are looking much better. It's the new treatment. No... come here. I hope you're heading for the bedroom. You stop it. Darling, you look like you looked 20 years ago. You flatter me. Now, you tell me what the hell is going on. I don't know. Sickbay, medical emergency in the Admiral's quarters. I found chemical substances in his blood and tissue samples, but none of them are in our pharmacopoeia. I'm still working on alien references to such substances. But he's certainly ingested something that's strongly affecting his body. Specifics, Doctor. I can't give specifics until I do a lot more tests. What do you have? His red cell count's running riot. The cellular structure of his body is changing, but we don't know what it's changing to. His DNA is skewed. Don't ask me how, but he even looks younger. And, Captain, there are absolutely no traces of Iversons disease. You said there was no cure. None that we know of. Whatever these substances are doing, at least they've done that. But how or why? It's too early to say. Get me some answers, Doctor. As soon as possible. Yes, sir. Captain. Mrs. Jameson, I have to ask the Admiral some questions. Ask away. There's nothing to hide now. Sir, in addition to your rank, you are particularly valuable just now. Starfleet has a right to some answers. I've planned this for a long time, ever since I learned I had Iversons. Since it put me in that chair. What did you do? There's a planet in the Cerebus system: Cerebus II. They have a process that rejuvenates the body, gives you your youth back. I've heard that story. It's a myth. It's true, Picard. I'm living proof. It's dangerous. The mortality rate is high, and it's very painful. Aliens are seldom allowed to obtain the process, but I managed it. I negotiated a treaty for Cerebus II some years ago, and they felt obligated to honor my request for the process. Obviously it works rapidly, but how does it work? The herb and drug combinations are self-administered slowly over a period of two years. Every response is different depending on a being's DNA. I got enough for both of us, but I had to test it. I couldn't risk you. If I died, well, I was half a man, so what did it matter? It would matter to me. I was starting to change. It... was almost undetectable, but the improvement was there. Then when this hostage crisis came up, I knew I had to be at my peak. I couldn't wait for the drug to work naturally... So you took the whole dose? Both of them. And look at me, Annie. I'm strong. I'm alert. Fit. I'm fitter than you are, Picard. I'm getting younger. The only question I have is why you thought it necessary to be young to negotiate the hostages' release. Even willing to put your life at risk for it. I'll be on the bridge, Admiral, if you want to talk further. Why didn't you tell me, Mark? We've always been honest with each other until now. I did it for us. I'm sure you believed that, until you had a chance to lead a mission, and to command again. Then you just upended the bottle, or whatever it was, and damn everything. Did you think about me at all? I obtained enough of the dosage for both of us. But you never asked if I wanted it. It's just like you to assume that what you felt was right was the answer. It was the right answer for me. It was killing you, caring for an invalid. What good was I? We can be together again. Let me go. I can get you another supply of the drug. Cmdr Data, I wish to open a communication frequency to Karnas. Aye, sir. One moment. Admiral, this is Picard. May I know the reason for this communication? Karnas must have tried to negotiate before he was forced to call on me. I want all the information he has access to. You said Karnas was proud, and probably sensitive to his failure. Is it wise to press him? I am the negotiator. Karnas will have to cooperate with me, and damn his sensitivities. Then may I suggest a secured channel, Admiral? A sensible precaution, Picard. Make it so. Make it so. Aye, sir. Frequency open and secured. Karnas. What is it, Admiral? We're on a secured channel, Karnas. You can talk freely. Who's behind this thing? You said dissidents. Yes, political opponents who feel the Federation will disavow me if they stir up enough trouble here. Then who is it? Ardan? Gilnor? They're dead, Jameson. A long time now. A long time I thought you were dead, too. I almost died a few times on missions, but I always survived somehow. Yes. Now you're returning to Mordan to negotiate for hostages again. It's almost as though the 45 years in between never happened. You've never forgiven me. Of course I have. It was years ago. There are no dissidents, are there? No terrorists. You have the hostages. And if I have... ? You're coming to Mordan, and you're going to negotiate for their lives. And I'm going to ask a very, very high price. What if I refuse? Then the hostages will die. You've seen how my executioners work. They are still as efficient as they were, perhaps even more skilled now. You'll come... even if you don't have much honor left. Conn, are we still on schedule to arrive at Mordan in 38 hours? Aye, sir, we're at warp four. I want to jump to warp eight, so we arrive ahead of our announced ETA. It'll throw Karnas off balance, and we can catch him before he's ready. Ready for what exactly? I believe Karnas has the hostages and there never were any dissidents. Why have you come to that conclusion? I'm not at liberty to say, but negotiations are no longer the answer. Isn't the most important thing the hostages' lives? And you agree, Riker? I do. Good. Because I plan to lead the away team on an armed mission to get them out of there. Cmdr Data, bring up the plans I requested on the viewscreen, please. Aye, sir. Most of Mordan's principal city was devastated during the war. What was left consisted largely of a network of underground tunnels. A rats' maze. When they rebuilt the city, they built over the tunnels. I have it, sir. Sir, where do these tunnels come into the picture? It's where Karnas held his hostages before, and where I believe he has them now. Wouldn't that be too obvious? Karnas is a dogged strategist, not a brilliant one. He sticks to what works. He will kill the hostages if we do not get them out. Therefore this armed raid is the only option? You don't agree? With respect, I would point out that no one else has heard Karnas's demands. The Federation might view them differently if they knew of them. Starfleet has given me command of the away team, Picard, and I intend to use them as I see fit. Our anniversary is next week. Our 50th. In his heart, he's still the same man you married. That's true. He still cares for you, despite the physical changes he's undergoing. But he's getting younger, and I'm... Well, look at me. Why did he do this? Because there are lives at stake, Mrs. Jameson. Well, what about our lives, his and mine? I was looking forward to time together, finally. Our retirement. Now he's young again, and has his life to live over. Doctor, she has to know. Know what? Your husband... What is it? He's not stabilizing. He may not have that life to live over. We'll be at Mordan in three hours. I couldn't sleep, either. I never could before a mission. I always wound up in the observation lounge, staring out, thinking. Perhaps in this case... rethinking. Why is this so important? Why did you risk your life to lead it? I want to save lives, Captain. Noble sentiments, but that's too easy an answer. You've been here before. You negotiated a release of the hostages with Karnas before. Why is it now your answer is an armed raid? It's my away team you're sending in there. There's something you're not saying. I have a right to know. Do you know the background? The Mordanites had some sophistication, but were still ruled by family tribal units. Karnas's father was the ruling chief of one of the families. Another tribe had him assassinated. Karnas seized the passengers of a starliner and held them hostage, demanding that Starfleet provide him with weapons that would enable him to defeat his rivals. That's the official record. Officially, the story is that after two other mediators were murdered, I went in and negotiated with Karnas to bring out the hostages. Are you saying that's not the truth? It wasn't my... golden oratory that saved them, Captain. I gave Karnas the weapons he wanted. You did what? I gave the same weapons to his rivals. My interpretation of the Prime Directive. Let them solve their problems with those arms on an equal basis. And that decision plunged them into 40 years of civil war. I didn't know that would happen. I thought it'd be over in a year. How would I know it would take four decades? But I... falsified the records to Starfleet. I lived with that on my soul. 63 people came away safe, but millions died on Mordan because I delivered those weapons. Karnas could have worked for peace instead of fighting. It's not all on your head. But I started it. I lit the match. Now finally I can vindicate myself, if only in a small way. I came to negotiate, but that isn't what Karnas wants. Revenge. That's why he demanded you when he knew you were still alive. I'm not going to give it to him. I will do what I should have done last time. We're taking the hostages out by force, if necessary. No deals. Prepare to energize, Chief. Belay that. Admiral, your proper place is on the bridge. I will remind you one more time, Picard. I am the Senior Mission Commander and I am leading this team. Sir? The Admiral is correct, Number One. He has that right. But I am the Captain of this ship, and I have a right to accompany him. Riker, you're in command of the Enterprise. Energize. Yes. Perfect. We are in the M-4 tunnel, directly under the Governor's residence. M-4 is a subsidiary tunnel, but it links with several main ones. Sorry, sir. That does not correspond with the information in my tricorder. It is incorrect. I know the tunnels like the back of my hand. Keep scanning for signs of human life forms. Karnas held the hostages in these tunnels before. He'll do it again. Captain, the Admiral is definitely incorrect. Our tunnel schematics show this was sealed off two years ago. No doubt you're right. But 45 years ago, I'm sure it joined the tunnels the Admiral remembers. Damn. This is steelplast, sir. Fairly recent installation. This is the most direct route. Set phasers to cut through it. If you have the coordinates where the hostages are, we could beam there. Karnas may not have them together. There's no substitute, Lieutenant, for a personal reconnoiter. Admiral, there's an infrared light signal ahead. Steady beam, across the tunnel, chest-high. Another at waist level. An alarm trigger or... Reset phasers to stun. Take cover! Look out! Their phasers are set on kill. Thank you, Mr. Data. I have heard the sound before. Is he hit? No sign of a wound. Enterprise, this is Picard. Six to beam up, now! The Admiral? Sickbay. ""Not good"" is a galactic understatement. Sir? Karnas again. On screen. There has been an armed intrusion in the tunnels beneath the city. That smells of Jameson. Where is he? This is Picard. I'm sorry to inform you, the Admiral is critically ill. That is not my concern. Sick or well, you have ten minutes to beam him down. Sickbay to bridge. Picard. Dr Crusher requests your presence immediately, sir. I'm on my way. Sickbay. What is it, Doctor? I think you'd better see for yourself. I have to get to Karnas. I can't allow it. It's my last option. The raid failed. All I have to bargain with is myself. Bridge to Picard. Picard here. A new message from Karnas, sir. We deliver Jameson in five minutes, or a hostage dies. 15 minutes after that, another. He promises the method of execution will be most painful. Let me go. If I give myself over to him, he'll let the hostages go. It's me he wants. It means almost certain death for you. My life for how many hostages? 20? Let me go. Inform Karnas we'll be beaming down in under five minutes. Did you say ""we,"" sir? You have your orders. Aye, sir. Who are you? I want Jameson. Karnas... this is Admiral Mark Jameson. This... charade will accomplish nothing, Picard. Beam down Jameson and the hostages will be freed. Continue this and they will die. And you with them. Peretor Karnas, you always were stubborn. I thought you wanted me. I'm here. Release the hostages now. Peretor was my old title. Why do you call me that? I warn you, Picard. This trick is going on too far. He has been coached for some devious reason. If this farce does not stop immediately, you and the hostages will be put to death. Doctor! I am waiting for an explanation, Captain. He is the Admiral! He took an overdose of an alien de-ageing drug. He... wanted to face you with strength again, on even terms. This is what the drug has done. This story is unbelievable! Jameson is a man of more than 80 years, not this! I want that old man, Picard. I want to show him this world he helped to make. The scars on old soldiers' bodies. The graveyards of our young dead. The wasted cities that we are still rebuilding. And all of it caused by him. It was you who demanded the weapons to avenge your father's death. But Jameson didn't give weapons to only us. If he had, we would have quickly beaten our enemies and there would have been peace long ago. I want him to pay for that, Picard. I think Mrs. Jameson should beam down now. Enterprise, this is Picard. Have Mrs. Jameson prepare to beam down. We have brought visual records we made of the Admiral's deterioration. Look at them. Don't waste my time. Just a few moments. You saw the Admiral en route here? Yes. And recognized him? Yes. Is this who you saw? This is the man I want! He's here, Karnas. Look. Once he took the compound, there was no way to stop it. You'll have to deal with me, Karnas. Whatever you wanted from Jameson isn't possible now. And you wanted revenge. You blamed your war on him. No doubt he had a lot to do with it, but you used the weapons. You could've tried for negotiations for peace on your planet long ago. Instead, you chose to fight. How many of those 40 years of war are on your head? Jameson must pay. I've sworn it to my people. 45 years ago he made the wrong decision. He wanted to right it, to atone for what he did. Now all he can do is give himself up to you. He brought this retribution on himself. No. I don't believe you. You're shielding Jameson on the ship. This tale is to save his life. Peretor Karnas... there were only two of us in the meeting. You didn't even trust your lieutenants there. You told me that old Peretor Sain had ordered your father's assassination. You told me that you wanted arms to destroy him. Peace... wasn't on your mind. All you wanted was revenge. And I gave you the weapons to do it. Jameson told you this. If it is you, show me the scar. There! The blood cut you gave me to seal our bargain. It is you. Somehow... it is you. Then die by your own weapon! No. No, my revenge will be in seeing you live like this. Such pain. His cells are being forced to go younger. They can't take the stress. It's like they're imploding. I can't give him anything to stop it. Can you ease the pain? Mark, can you hear me? Yes. I will always love you. Annie with the golden hair. Flatterer. It's grey now. I see only the gold. Rest, Jameson. Your long night... and mine... are over. The hostages will be freed immediately, Captain. I'm... prepared to be... cooperative. The hostages have been freed by Karnas, unharmed. The body of Admiral Mark Jameson has been buried on Mordan, at the request of his widow, and by the permission of Karnas. The quest for youth, Number One... So futile. Age and wisdom have their graces too. I wonder if one doesn't have to have age and wisdom to appreciate that. I hope not, Number One. Mr. La Forge, prepare to take us out of orbit. Set course for Isis III. Aye, sir. Leaving orbit. "
S1E17,"Cmdr Riker, report to bridge. On the way. Harry! Come back here. What's your hurry? Sorry, Commander. I was just... Sorry if he bothered you. No bother, Dr Bernard. I'm not going back. I hate that teacher and I hate calculus. Everyone needs an understanding of basic calculus, like it or not. Why? You're limping. A run-in with an aspiring sprinter. Number One. Problem? More a curiosity. We've been tracking faint energy readings to locate its source. It's like following a trail of breadcrumbs. The pathfinder led us here and then stopped, which I knew would interest you. What's our position, Geordi? The Epsilon Mynos system, sir. Captain, you're right. I wouldn't miss this. What's so interesting about this system? Aldea. I'm surprised you haven't heard of Aldea, the wondrous, mythical world. Like Atlantis of Ancient Earth, or Neinman of Xerxes VII. Advanced culture, centuries old. Self-contained. Peaceful. Incredible technical sophistication providing for all citizens, who turned themselves over to art and culture. Where is it? That's the myth. Legends say the Aldeans were able to cloak their planet in darkness and go unseen by marauders and other hostile passers-by who might rob and plunder. What a wonderful fairy tale. Scanners still show nothing. Scanners may show nothing, but I'm sensing something very strong. Thousands of minds. From where? Very close. All stop, and hold this position. Aye, sir. All stop... and hold. Anything? I'm recording a distortion in quadrant one, mark 9-0. On screen. Shields and deflectors up. Aye, sir. It's Aldea, Captain. It has to be. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 41509.1. Either by chance or intent, we've been led to the planet Aldea, which appeared out of nowhere, hidden behind a shielding device. Sensors indicate that the shield is electromagnetic, a complicated light-refracting mechanism. A cloaking device? Aye, sir. It must be pretty sophisticated to hide a planet. We're being scanned, sir. We'll let them know our peaceful intention. Open hailing frequencies. Frequencies open, sir. I am Rashella. Welcome to Aldea. I... I am Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the USS Enterprise. We come in peace. We know. We've heard stories about Aldea, but I never believed they could be true. Our shield has confused outsiders for millennia, Captain. That's a very long time to have such technology. Why do you reveal yourselves now? We are eager to meet to discuss that, and other subjects of mutual interest. We're ready any time. Excellent. We mean no harm. Our arrival seems to have startled you. It was a little sudden. I'm Radue, First Appointee to Aldea. Welcome aboard. They haven't been through decontamination. Our Doctor is concerned you didn't go through our transporting procedure. You couldn't transport us. The only way through our shield is our way. Our cloaking device may be off, but our shield is operating. We've brought you small tokens of welcome. And a personal invitation to a celebration on Aldea. That would be delightful. Number One, assemble the away team. We will prepare for your arrival, Cmdr Riker. How do you know... Your name? We've been monitoring your ship's communications. We must now return to Aldea. Our eyes are very sensitive to bright light. Rashella. Amazing. To exist only in that dream world of myth, and then suddenly to be here. They placed the breadcrumbs. We're not here by accident. Do you sense anything? They want something from us, something we value greatly. So much that they're afraid we won't part with it. We are ready to receive you, Cmdr Riker, and two of your colleagues. Interesting choices. I hope that Duana and I know how to greet you properly, Commander. How does the cloak work? The theory is simple. The shield bends light around the planet's contour, like the Romulan cloaking device. But the implementation is quite difficult. Captain? Data, what do you read? Some sort of scanning device, sir. Don't touch him! It's from Aldea. Shields up. Contact Riker. Worf, check decks. Shields inoperable. All decks being probed. All decks? The entire ship? Aye, sir. I can't reach the Commander. We're blocked. Wesley, are you alright? It was scary at first... but I didn't really feel anything. Sir, similar incidents all decks... but only with the children. Yes, we are an ancient power, but we've suffered for it. Our history is littered with the deaths of Aldeans who wanted more things. Nothing was ever enough. So, we've evolved a simple way of living. For whatever is taken, something is given in return. That seems an equitable code. It's brought us peace. Unfortunately, there are few of us left to enjoy it. Why? That is part of what we wish to discuss. We need help from the Federation to rebuild our heritage. We need a younger generation, strong and healthy, following in the Aldean traditions. How can the Federation help influence your children in your traditions? Because we have no children, Commander. Rashella was the last child born on this planet. And your medical community can do nothing? They've tried, Dr Crusher... and failed. Perhaps we can help. Exactly why were we invited here? We propose a trade which would solve our problem, and give something to the Federation. The nature of this trade? We need some of your children. We'll give you information that would take you centuries to acquire. That might be acceptable to some other races, but... humans are unusually attached to their offspring. Our children are not for sale at any price. We sympathize with your situation, but what you ask is not possible. And that's your final answer? That's my only answer. If there's another way we can help... I'm sorry you are so intransigent. Still no response, sir. Wesley! They've taken my son. Alexandra? Saucer section reports six more children have gone. It's the children. That's why we're here. That's what they wanted. And that's what they have. Status? Aldean shield still up. No response. Keep trying. Counselor, gather the parents. They'll need to speak to you as well. Captain, your children are with us. My word of honor, no harm will ever come to them. Harm has already come to them. Let us begin discussions regarding appropriate compensation. Compensation? You have stolen our children from their classrooms and bedrooms, and you talk about compensation? You claim to be civilized, yet you have committed an act of barbarity! Captain, we will continue these discussions when you've calmed down. Wesley... I'm frightened. I know you are, Katie. We all are. But we're gonna be alright. Everyone knows where we are. No one is going to hurt you. I promise. Greetings, Wesley Crusher. The Custodian indicated that you would be the leader. The Custodian? Who is the Custodian? The Custodian is not a person. You are here as our guests. We'll provide anything you need or want. We want to go home. Wesley, all of you have been chosen because you are... special. Just ask for anything you want, and you shall have it. What's happened to Alexandra and the other children? How are you getting them back? Toya, sit down. Don't give in to fear. We all knew the risks when we signed on. That's the choice we made. Capt Picard will do anything to bring them back. The Aldeans want to discuss compensation. Compensation? That will buy us time. Dr Crusher will be involved in these negotiations as your representative. Why were these specific children taken? We can't be sure. We do know the Aldeans can't have children of their own. Then they won't let them go easily. I won't insult you by pretending that this will be easy. But I can tell you that we will not leave them behind. You can be assured of that. Can we talk with our children? Give them some reassurance? Let them know that they will be safe. I'll do my best to arrange that. The last time I saw him, I yelled at him. There you are! I have you now! Don't be alarmed. The other children have been assigned to their units. Units? A unit is a group where those of similar talents live together. Do you mean like a family? You could call it that. We already have families. Does Capt Picard know about this? We keep nothing from him. We've been waiting for you so long, Harry. We are artists, just like you. We see within you your potential. I'm not an artist. You will be, and a great one. This way. Unit B, 375. I am honored. Thank you. Melian is the foremost musician on Aldea. Music speaks its own language. We'll have much to learn from each other. Don't worry, you'll be seeing Wesley soon. What about me? Don't I get a say in this? Wesley, sometimes something happens which you just must accept. You are all now members of this society. That will not change, so make the transition as easy as possible for the others. It's your duty because you are their leader. Help them to accept it. Nothing you or those on the starship can do can change it. Because, like you... ...we also have no choice. Where have you been, Rashella? Zena and Aran are waiting for Alexandra. No. No? I told you that she... No, Radue. They can't have her. I will never let her go. Any response from Aldea? Not yet. Captain... Data has found something interesting. The Aldean shield gives evidence of random fluctuations, weakening its structure in sections. There are holes in their defense? In essence, yes. I find it surprising that the Aldeans have not perfected their technology. I'd assume they'd have repaired it. Could we beam a team through those holes? Possibly. It would have to be perfectly timed. We may be able to decipher the code to transport through the shield. Can you do that? I'm working on it now. But the permutations are almost endless. Keep trying. Number One, you and La Forge try and find some way of getting through one of those holes. Somehow, an away team must locate the power source for the shield and neutralize it. You're certain they'll negotiate? They'll negotiate. Or they'll call it that. They've taken what they want. Now, they'll rationalize it by throwing us some bone. And when we don't accept their offer? Once they believe we won't accept their compensation, they'll break off the discussion, disappear behind their shield, locking us out and the children in... for ever. That's why I've got to keep them talking. Custodian, Wesley Crusher's voice will be entered into the authorized file for third-level clearance. Proceed, Duana. Announce yourself to the Custodian. Hello, Custodian. I am Wesley Crusher. Hello, Wesley. Your voice will now activate third-level clearance. What does that mean? You may ask any questions you wish. Thank you. Duana, what does the Custodian do? It frees us from burden, takes care of our needs. It regulates our lives. Who built it? The Progenitors. When? Hundreds of centuries ago. What is its power source? Wesley, why is that important? It does what we ask. It always has. What difference does it make how it works? If you don't know, how can you repair it? Why would we want to repair it? From time to time, every computer, I mean, Custodian, needs maintenance. Wesley, Radue was right. You ask questions I can't answer. Ask the Custodian instead. Custodian, can you show me where Harry is? Yes. Custodian, show me Harry. I never did this before. It's fun. You're making him into a sculptor? He already is. He was just never encouraged properly. That tool will allow him to bring out his visions. It'll take years to learn that. No. It will happen quite quickly. Custodian, show me Alexandra. Custodian, show me Mason. Stop, Custodian. We must work, now. There's much to learn. What's in there? The power source? I don't know. Captain's log, supplemental. We remain in orbit around Aldea. It's becoming evident that talk will not effect the return of our children. We must neutralize the Aldean shield. Until then, we are helpless. Sir, Radue is hailing us. Capt Picard? Dr Crusher and I are ready, Radue. Are you ill, Captain? No, Dr Crusher is a staff officer. Starfleet regulation 6.57 requires that two staff officers are present during any negotiations. Very well. Not much on pleasantries, is he? Captain, I am not aware of regulation 6.57. No, neither am I. I see, sir. Dr Crusher, report to the bridge. We'll see what they have in mind. Before we begin, we want to see the children. No. We're here to negotiate compensation, not pander to emotions. Please sit. We do not condone your actions. You're offering us goods in exchange for our children. Why do you want them back? You can have more. You're trifling with our primal instincts. I must warn you that humans are willing to die for their children. Returning the children is non-negotiable. I promise you, they will have a beautiful life with us. And they'll be parents to a new breed born of an ancient culture. But how can you be sure that they can have children? You can't. But they will. Our inability to bear children is a genetic dysfunction. It's not contagious. We... sympathize with your situation. Surely there is a solution that can be mutually satisfactory? For us, the problem is solved. We're offering you information on areas of the galaxy you do not even know exist. What more can we offer? What more would you like? A significant beginning. But first, I ask that Dr Crusher be allowed to see her son. You are a stubborn people. Well, that, too, can be a positive trait. You may see him. Mom! Wes. I knew you all would get us home. Not yet, Wes. Are you OK? And the others? OK. Really OK. We've been assigned to our units, like families. They're treating us like gods. Don't let it go to your head. I won't. Wes seems fine. He says the others are too. Of course they're well. You have our offer. It is final. Captain. We want you to understand the nature of your choice. A small demonstration of our power. What was that? A repulser beam. Position report. This is unbelievable, sir. According to my calculations, we're three days from Aldea. At warp nine. That's a small demonstration? Geordi, get us back to Aldea. Aye, sir. Captain, if you don't accept our terms, the Enterprise will be pushed so far away, that by the time you return, your children will be grandparents. Captain's log, stardate 41512.4. We are 20 hours from Aldea, and no closer to a solution. Their show of force pushed us out of orbit, and could have destroyed us. Hold it a little bit more firmly. That's it. Perfect. Now, think... No, ""think"" is not right. Feel the notes inside your head. I'm sorry. Did I break it? No, it's alright. You can't break this. It did exactly what I thought... I mean, felt. Yes, it's a direct reflection of the music within. Now, we just have to teach you to structure that feeling. Try it again. That was beautiful. Now... play something happier. That's not the way I feel. I don't want to do this any more. See, Harry? I told you you would be an artist. Are you sure? Did I really do this? Oh, yes. Your talent has always been there. The sculpting tool is just helping you develop it. It's what you were meant to do. I don't have to take calculus any more? You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. What's calculus? Nothing important. Can I do some more? Captain's log, supplemental. It is three days since the Aldeans pushed us away. We have had no contact with Radue since then. Open hailing frequencies, Lt Yar. Frequencies open, sir. Radue, this is Picard. Welcome back, Captain. What have you decided? That there is room for discussion, Radue. We will bring you down when we're ready. Data, defeat that shield. That may be impossible. Things are only impossible until they're not. Captain. Here's what I've learned so far. Duana is dying. I don't think the other Aldeans are any healthier. They have chromosomal damage. It could be genetic or environmental. That's why they can't conceive. It explains their lack of appetite, extreme pallor and sensitivity to light. An entire civilization that's terminally ill. Is it reversible? I won't know until I find the cause. And I know, time is running out. Good work, Doctor. Have the lesions gone? Yes. The medicine worked again. Good. Come see what Harry's doing. Beautiful. Yeah. It really turned out well. It's so alive and graceful. What d'you call it? It's a dolphin. It swims in the ocean, like a fish, only it's not a fish. A fish. We used to have those in our oceans. I've never seen one before. I used to live near the ocean on Zadar IV. My dad's an oceanographer. He says that... Never mind. It... doesn't matter. I want Mommy. You haven't eaten. You didn't eat anything. We need very little. We know you miss your family. But you'll grow accustomed to us. I promise you'll be happy. We were happy before we came. We are offering more... especially for you. Duana... I feel badly for you that you have no children. But I have to tell you that we don't want to be here, and we will not cooperate. Custodian's room. Custodian, this is Wesley Crusher. Proceed, Wesley. Show me where the Enterprise children are in relation to here. Thank you. Goodnight. Goodnight, Wesley. I think I know a way to get us home. I need your help. Chief Medical Officer's log, stardate 41512.9. I suspect that whatever is killing the Aldeans is related to a danger faced by Earth in the 21st century. Can it be that Aldea's ozone layer has been weakened? Why will not talking or eating make them send us home? It's called passive resistance. We don't do what they want us to do, and they won't want us. Will they get mad at us? They won't hurt us. But, Wes, I do kinda like them. So do I. But I don't want to stay here for ever. Do you? No. But I like working with the wood. Harry, we all have to be in this together, or it's not gonna work. OK. I'll do it. What are you all doing here? What is going on here? I've got it. The Aldeans are suffering from radiation poisoning. Is that why they're sterile? Yes. Is it reversible? With treatment. Captain... these permutations are going to take a very long time. How long? Weeks. There is another way. We defined weakness in the shield. It's not a hole, it's a fluctuation. It may be possible to beam onto the planet. Why don't we beam the children up? The risk would be greater. You and Data beam down. Find the power source. Knock it out. I'll delay the Aldeans till you're ready. Will you at least eat? No, Alexandra. Why? We can't eat. I know you're hungry. We all are. But it's our way of saying we want to go home. Understand? Yeah. We're ready, Lt Worf. Captain, you may come down now to conclude our discussions, or your ship may leave. It's your choice. Dr Crusher and I are prepared to conclude our negotiations. Transporter room, now! This is it, Commander. It is programmed to accept only authorized voice command. We can't override? No. But I can scramble the input so that nobody else can. Before we begin, Captain, you must speak with the children. It seems they are on some sort of strike. I don't understand it. You must deal with this, Captain. I'm... not very good with children. Strike? I'll see what I can do. I'm sure if we just stick together, guys, we'll all be... Hi, Capt Picard. Sir, I knew you'd come. It's not over yet, Wesley. I think I figured out the computer, but I'm not sure. It's a different system from ours. Good, Wesley. Now... Captain? Yes, Harry? If something happens and we have to stay, will you tell my dad I'm sorry I made him angry, and... that I miss him? You will tell him that. And I will tell him how much I admire his son. Hello, Alexandra. Hi. What is this? They want to go home. No. They're staying. Number One. We're in position. Hold for orders. The radiation levels on Aldea have been building up over a long time. It happened on Earth in the 21st century. The ozone layer deteriorated, and the planet was flooded with ultraviolet radiation. The shield that protected your world is also weakening it. The radiation of your own sun is destroying you. You're trying to confuse the issue. Please, listen. You're all suffering from radiation poisoning. Sterility is only the latest symptom. The children will be affected as well. Impossible. Our scientists would have known. How? They've forgotten how everything works. No. All lies. No. Wait. Don't send them back yet. What if they're right? Instead of the children being our hope, what if we're condemning them to our fate? They're just protecting their interests. As are we. But hear them out. They are saying that the very thing which has given us this world is what has caused this tragedy. Exactly. Your Custodian has controlled you so completely, you won't even question it. Lies, and the discussion is over. Cmdr Riker? I assume you have control of the computer? We disabled it temporarily. We neutralized the power source. Good. Enterprise, this is Picard. Beam the children up. Wait. Enterprise, hold. Thank you. Let me get the dolphin for you. No, you keep it. I'll make another one. Alright, Harry? Yes, Captain. OK, kids. Let's go home. Beam them up. You have destroyed us. We're not here to destroy you, Radue. We can help you. What is it? A legacy of your Progenitors. The source of your power and of your problems. It's reading incredible amounts of energy. More since we've taken down the shield. What are we going to do with it? Learn, all over again. All this time, we've been destroying ourselves, so sure of our technological invulnerability. Now, we must learn to use this power safely. Will you let us help? Yes. Please. I want to be an artist. I don't want to take calculus. You can be anything you want, Harry. Anything. But... you still have to take calculus. OK. Thanks, Dad. It worked well, sir. We have successfully re-seeded the ozone layer. But for it to be sustained, they can never use the shield. Or be cloaked again. Are you finished? Yes, and they're responding very well to the treatment. The legend will die... but the people will live. We know they'll make good parents. Wesley! Sorry, Captain. She wanted to thank you for bringing her home to her mother. Thank you. Come on, Alexandra. Mr. La Forge, out of orbit. Warp five. Yes, sir. Certainly, sir. "
S1E18,"Captain's log, stardate 41463.9. We have been asked by the Federation to visit a group terraforming Velara III. Communications have been erratic, and there is concern about their welfare. Entering standard orbit... now. It takes special people to live in such desolation. Visionaries who see the planet as it will be. I'd love to see terraforming in operation. Lt Yar, hailing frequencies. Frequencies open, sir. Velara III base, this is Capt Picard of the Starship Enterprise. No malfunctioning equipment, sir. They are receiving us. Velara III base, come in, please. Over. Maybe no one's home. We are sensing life forms, sir. Velara III base, do you copy? Velara base to Enterprise. Yes, Captain, I'm Director Mandl, and... I'm sorry about the delay, but we weren't expecting visitors. Terraform Command has asked us to see how you were getting along. We were behind but we're back on schedule. I'd like to hope we'd be allowed to maintain that schedule. We alarm him for some reason. Your staff are well, I presume, Director? Understandably tired. We're working very hard, Captain. If there is anything we can do... You and your staff are very welcome aboard for a rest. We have holodecks you'll enjoy. No disrespect, but we cannot afford the time. Channel closed. His fear is escalating. If youll excuse me, I must get back to work. I sense deliberate concealment, sir. Of what? I don't know, but it's intense. We've heard of your remarkable achievements in terraforming. My crew would appreciate looking around. This is not really the best time. We are at a very critical phase. We require no special attention. I'm trying not to be rude, sir, but this is really very inconvenient. He is concealing something. It's more than being too busy. Your announcement about coming down has sent him to a point of panic. Well, whether he wants us or not. Unless you're absolutely refusing us permission to land at your station, prepare to receive our away team. As you wish. Counselor, you'd better go too. Aye, sir. Someone that tense can be unpredictable. Stay on your toes. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Welcome to Velara III. Please... Remember it as it is now. In two decades, you won't recognize it. Luisa Kim. Gardener of Edens. Cmdr Riker, USS Enterprise. This is Counselor Troi, Lt Yar, Lt La Forge, Lt Cmdr Data. Arthur Malencon, hydraulics specialist, and Bjorn Bensen, Chief Engineer. An android? And third-in-command of the Enterprise. Where were you manufactured? Are there others like you? Both matters are subjects of protracted discussion. Remarkable. Excuse me. We don't get many visitors. It's exciting to have you here. We weren't sure how we would be received. Director Mandl was less than enthusiastic about our interest. I should apologize for him. We are at a critical phase. Usually he's charming. We'll stay out of the way. We've never seen a terraforming station and... ...we appreciate the opportunity. How much do you know? Theories, reports, but nothing first-hand. Wonderful. Let me show you what we do. Newcomers find this... The other two are secretive, but she is open. What we're doing is so exciting, so inspiring. We take a lifeless planet... ...and transform it to an M-Class environment, capable of supporting life. Terraforming... ...makes you feel a little God-like. The first phase involves selecting the planet. That's very important. It must have the right mass, gravity, correct rate of rotation, and a balanced day and night. The planet must also be without life or the prospect of life developing naturally. The Federation determines if that's so. Then, we take over. This station is phase two. Phase three involves water. Usually we create basins using hydraulic landscaping, but the water on this planet is subsurface, and extremely high in salt content. We're just about to begin pumping and filtering the water. Removing the salt, oxygenating and replacing. Next... we introduce micro-organisms. And when the process is complete, we'll have a lush, arable biosphere. You make it sound poetic. I think it's the best job in the universe. The efficiency of your hydraulic landscaping is quite elegant. It isn't yet, but it will be. Right now I'm disturbed by the erratic power surges in the servo-mechanisms that control the hydraulic probes. Could it be caused by the high saline content? That was my first thought, but... Arthur! The factors do not support that conclusion. I'm Director Mandl, and I'm sorry about having been so abrupt earlier. Being isolated, one forgets the social graces. Are you seeing everything? What you're doing is miraculous. What we're doing is working a demanding timetable, and there will be no miracle unless Malencon here gets the hydraulic probes back on line. We are set to step up to full conversion immediately. Shouldn't you be in the hydraulic chamber? Now? Yes. Alright, Kurt. Geordi. This appears to be the master subsurface pump. You're right. Very impressive. It's interesting. The water table is a thin ribbon between the surface layer and the rocks below. And the two surfaces follow that contour so precisely, the water maintains a consistent depth between them. Which would require extreme precision from the probe controls. Here we have something that may be of interest to you. A vegetation graph. It is, really, the key centre for successful terraforming. Incredible. It's planned month by month, decade by decade? Every single thing is specific and exact. You see grand, Romantic concepts. I see unyielding rock under an ocean of sand. Commander! What is it, Deanna? Malencon. He's in trouble! Help! Can you open it? It's jammed! First Officer's log, stardate 41464.3. A routine visit to a terraforming site has turned into something more serious. Arthur Malencon has been critically injured by a laser drill, which appears to have malfunctioned. Situation report, Number One. We're shutting off all power before entering to recover the body. We'll beam him up to sickbay, but looking at his wounds, it's probably hopeless. Keep me informed. Data? Go ahead, Geordi. All set. Data, the section is powered down. Bensen has locked the master servomotor drive, so it should be safe. I'm going in. I will too. Transporter room, this is Lt Yar. Two to beam up to sickbay. I want to go. We should be with him. Kurt, please come too. Transporter room, this is Riker. Beam up four, at my coordinates. Geordi, this is intriguing. I've seen malfunctions. But this... It's almost as if the laser drill seemed to operate with a will separate from its control console. I can't explain it. The laser blasts seemed to end when the yelling stopped. Maybe Arthur stopped it, only not in time. Not possible. Then what are you suggesting? Uncertain. Geordi, please return power to the control console in this room. I will reactivate the program. You got it. I am now running the base-drilling program. Geordi! Servos off! They are off! What's happening? Too much to explain. Can you open that? La Forge to the Enterprise. We have a problem. Be specific. Data's under fire in the hydraulics room. Get him out of there! It's not working! We've gotta get this door open! Data! Away team, now! What is happening? I'll beam him out of there. Bridge, this is Lt Cmdr Data. No need to beam me up. The situation is under control. Are you alright? Yes. Well, what happened? Did you set it off? No, but the firing program was dynamic. The firing...? In what way? It adjusted to my tactics. It tracked with me, anticipating. A fixed program could not do that. Someone was controlling the aiming-and-firing sequence? That is how it appeared. There was a mind working against me. What did you do to this laser drill? A year's work destroyed! I had no choice. We were attempting to trace the malfunction when it attacked me. How much of this useless fantasy do I have to listen to? None. I have provided temporary quarters for you and your staff. Make use of them. You're overstepping your authority. You have no right to interfere. An attack on my crew gives me the right. I have a schedule to meet. It's on hold, till I have an explanation of this. Lt Yar, escort the Director to his quarters. Aye, sir. Go on with your report. The laser's drilling system was reprogrammed, sir. When its memory bank received power, it turned itself on and went after me. I was able to cope. Not by much, from what I saw. I believe it was programmed to destroy any person in that room. Certainty? Speculation? Certainty. That would require a master programmer's talents. But it was done. So the question is not who, since it was one of the three terraformers. The question is, why? What are they hiding? What could be so important that one or all of them could be desperate enough to kill? Shall I have them brought in? Not yet. Malencon? I couldn't save him. The injuries were too severe. Damage too extensive. The Velara III facility has been powered down. We have a power feed to the life-support systems. Data, I want you and Geordi to return for more careful inspection. What are we to look for? Evidence of negligence. Sabotage, whatever. The answer's there. Tasha, I want you to provide personnel records of our guests. Profiles, training. I'm looking for motive, intent, the psychological capacity to commit murder. Aye, sir. We are becoming detectives, Number One. Not much left of this drill. Geordi, I need some visual assistance. What is it? Nothing but basic elements. Inorganic. No carbon. Sandy texture. Those flashes are almost... musical. I... see color variations and... rhythms, in complex harmonies. Speculation. Could it be alive? How could it be alive? It's inorganic. Whatever it is, it could be what they are covering up. And the reason someone killed Malencon. Captain's log, supplemental. Data's startling discovery of a possible life form has been beamed aboard so that its true nature might be uncovered. But unlike life elsewhere, it appears to be completely inorganic. A test for inorganic life. It has never been done. There are basic definitions for organic life. Must have the ability to assimilate, respirate, reproduce, grow and develop, move, secrete and excrete. Would any apply here? Perhaps growth and development. Reproduction? Yes. Those may be basic for any definition of life, organic or inorganic. You're charting unknown seas. How do we proceed? Let's use the basic scientific method. Observe, theorize, and attempt to prove it. Activate. Let's be sure of what we're dealing with. Is the sample organic? Negative carbon. Negative known life components. Substance inorganic. Recheck analysis, please. Rechecking. Analysis verified. Not organic. Magnify the screen. Factor five. Hold surface. Factor ten. What are we looking at? It's beautiful, whatever it is. What's that hum? It started after Dr Crusher ordered the scanner to magnify. Computer, demagnify. Resume normal scan. Everyone stand back. Step back again. It's us! Yes. We're causing it. Why? Unknown. But it is definitely reacting to our presence. Perhaps it is picking up the electrical impulse of our systems. The flashes haven't changed. Could the hum be connected to them? Computer, magnify. What is the magnification? 2,500 diameters. Analyze the pattern of the flashes. Not repetitive or sequential. Pattern not recognized. What is the flashes' source? Unable to specify. Theoretically not possible from this substance. Disregard incongruity... and theorize as to source. Life. What do you mean, a life form? What life form? A Federation recon expedition certified Velara III lifeless. Understandable, given this particular life form's novel nature. What is that nature? Dr Crusher is still making her determination. Mr. Mandl... ...you know the Prime Directive. Are you saying that I knowingly defied it? You're a man obsessed with what you do. Who knows what an obsessed man will do to keep going. Kill, perhaps? I create life. I don't take it. You hit him hard, Captain. What do you think, Counselor? It was useful. I felt two levels. He did know about the life form. But the idea of murder shocked him. The idea, or just being accused, I can't tell. What about his file, Lt Yar? Could he have accomplished the reprogramming Data described? Mandl has degrees in computer science and artificial intelligence. It's possible. What about the others? The victim? Only the victim had the required expertise. Malencon did work where the... whatever it is was found. Suppressing that knowledge would be motive for murder. If Mandl were obsessed enough. Terraformers are often obsessive. It goes with the career profile. How do you read the designer? She is possessed of highly abstracted reality. Lovely visions. Little data. But you might do better than I. It's not locked. Mind a visitor? Is it true? Did you really find a life form? The debate is still going on in some quarters, but I think so, yes. What's it like? We have nothing we can compare it with. It's microscopic. It... It seems colonial, simple. But it's inorganic. Which is why the recon scouts missed it. It was not your mistake. Everything I've worked so hard for... ...is falling apart. Luisa... It's very beautiful. I could arrange for you to see it. Perhaps later. Captain, this is Dr Crusher. You'd better come to the Medical lab. What is it? Geordi observed movement. Not movement, but a shift in the energy pattern. Without external influence. The hum has gone. Why? Unknown, sir. Perhaps it is scanning us. Why? What could it hope to learn? Unknown at this time, sir. It's changing. I don't see anything. The infrared range is increasing. Warning. Input overload. The hum is back. Projecting an energy field. And it's intensifying. Magnification deactivated. Two of them! Only life can replicate itself, Doctor. Inorganic or not, it is alive. Activate quarantine field. Quarantine field full. Full shield backup. Evacuating lab. Translation request being patched. Translation? From whom? Evacuate! What's wrong with the translator circuit? Bridge, this is the Captain. Request emergency power to initiate lab quarantine seal. Do it, Mr. Worf. Aye, sir. What's the problem, Captain? We know Data's discovery is life. But more than that, it is intelligent life. How do you know, sir? It's trying to communicate with us. Captain's log, supplemental. The inorganic life form has taken over our Medical lab. Its energy is interfering with surrounding systems. Can we see into the lab? Negative. Reducing backup to the quarantine seal might help. Doctor? I wouldn't. Continue quarantine. Aye, sir. Director Mandl and the others are in the observation lounge. Counselor, I need you. You have the bridge, Number One. Director Mandl, once again, what do you know about these life forms? Not a thing. Enough! Sit down, Lieutenant. You are deliberately evasive and it must stop! You have kept information from me. An alien life form has taken possession of my Medical lab. You knew of its existence. Yes. Is this true? You knew there was life on Velara III? I knew that there were random energy patterns, yes. But not life. Not by any definition that I've ever heard. You kept that knowledge from us. No! They are meaningless silicon crystals, which rebroadcast sunlight. It is a life form, and has intelligence. Why do you say that? It's trying to communicate with us. Communicate with you? When did you become aware of them? Tell them about the pattern in the sand. Yes, do tell us. When we first arrived, we noticed that in certain areas the sand had a sparkling effect, like... sunlight bouncing off new fallen snow. What did you think it was? We did not give it any thought. Picard, I must point out again that we were assured, not once but many times, by the best scientific minds in the Federation, that this planet has no life. No life! And we were not looking... and therefore we did not see. Alright. At first you dismissed it. But then you began to understand that there was something that was different about them. You can't know that. Your apprehension suggested it, when we first arrived. Tell me about these patterns. At first we thought it was just a natural phenomenon of Velara III. Refraction and a thin atmosphere is interesting. But certainly not life. Why was I never told about this? Because it's not particularly important. As the building of the terraforming station went forward, the patterns in the sand ceased being random and became specific. Geometric shapes suddenly appearing, disappearing, changing location, changing size... Did you ever feel that these patterns were attempting to communicate? No. Never. Bensen? I don't know. At the time, I didn't think so. But now, after hearing what you just said... Now, I don't know. We've regained magnification of the life form. It's divided again. Patch visual to observation lounge. There was no indication of any of this on Velara III. Absolutely none. I cannot understand the patterns. Neither can I. Show me spectral analysis, magnification 12K. Silicon, germanium. Transistor material. Gallium arsenide. Emits light when charged. Cadmium sulphide. Emits charge when lit. Water, impurities, sodium salts. Conductor. But is it alive? Probability positive. I wasn't asking you. Engineering to bridge. Cmdr Riker. Go ahead. The backup on the lab seal is fluctuating, sir. I think you should come down. On my way. Data, you've got the bridge. Inform the Captain. Status, Ensign? The quarantine seal is getting weaker, sir. Every time I try to redirect backup, it goes somewhere else. I think I've... No... It's locked three people in a turbolift and two more in the programmers' restroom. There is no seal. Give me lab interior image. Yes, sir. Magnify. Picard, this is Riker. We see it too, Number One. Get that seal back up. No matter what I do, the energy goes somewhere else. What if it hits the sickbay? Hold on. Impossible, Captain. We haven't got the power. Captain's log, supplemental. The life form, which has significantly increased in size, is again attempting to communicate with us. The universal translator is coming on line, sir. Ugly... giant bags of mostly water. ""Bags of mostly water""? An accurate description of humans, sir. You are over 90 percent water. Life force, do you understand us? We understand. We ask that you be gone. We call. We talk. You do not listen. We didn't hear you. We come in peace. Ugly bags of mostly water. We try at peace. You still do not listen. Bags who drill in sand of home have to die. It killed Malencon. We see and hear you now. We didn't know you were there. You are beautiful to us. All life is beautiful. Bag in dome did know. Caused much death. Made us kill. War is now with you. The translator is off line, sir. Can you hear us now? Mr. La Forge? Restabilizing, Captain. Sir... that chaos when we were studying it in the lab must have been the energy surge of a reproductive cycle. It is now a colony of single cells organized as a computer. And like any computer... More is stronger. Captain's log, supplemental. We regained visual contact with the lab but our attempts to restore communication with this ""microbrain"" have been unsuccessful. One thing that is certain. This life form has declared war on us. Their influence is concentrated in the Medical lab. Non-essential personnel have gone to distant areas of the ship. Any analysis on those bolts of light it emits? A method of reprogramming. Each bolt consists of negatively and positively charged ions. A series of program instructions. It has a rapport with our computers. What do you expect? It is a computer. Have we disabled the Medical lab computer console? As soon as Data determined its method of operation. Captain, picking up a decrease in infrared intensity. Maybe it reached its energy level. Or maybe it's not the end. With single-celled life forms, at least organic ones, cell division is preceded by a resting state. The calm before the storm? Medical lab on main viewer. Let's use this calm. It does seem dormant, Captain. Tasha... Set coordinates to beam it back where it came from. Coordinates set, sir. Energize. Transporter power being redirected, sir. We are unable to affect it. Life form or not, intelligent or not, the safety of this ship is my primary responsibility. Data! Evacuate the air from the lab. I want a vacuum there. Environmental systems failed to respond to command. It appears the microbrain has interfaced with our computers. If it did try to communicate, we didn't understand! It has declared war and we are on the defensive! We are without a lab or a computer. It has the power to destroy this ship and everybody on it! I need your help. Unbelievable! It said you were trying to kill them. How? I don't know! What was Malencon doing when he was killed? There is a thin layer of saline water under the topsoil. He was siphoning that off. Perhaps somehow that saline water sustained them. It connected them. I don't understand. They may be like our brain cells. A cell has life, but not intelligence. Yet interconnected, their combined intelligence is formidable. The saline fluid is their circuitry. To prevent its loss, they killed Malencon. If we had continued to remove that water, we would have destroyed them all. Reason enough for anyone to go to war. Captain, it's happening again. You'd better get in here. It'll tear up the Enterprise. What can you determine? Captain, the microbrain expends a tremendous amount of energy during its reproductive cycle. Yet there is no power drain on our systems. What is feeding it? We found traces of cadmium salts. Cadmium converts infrared into electricity. Meaning? It might be photoelectric. Kill the lights in the lab. See if darkness will neutralize it. It still has control of the computer. We can't do it. Number One, lights. The life form must have evolved where the light got through the sand to the water. Drop the water a centimeter below the light-penetration level and they starve. Killing the lab lights... now. It's slowing down. It's getting dimmer, too. More light, please. Only if you will talk to us. We die. Bags of water kill us. You are like others. We have no wish to kill you. We never have. You do not say truth. We will end this war, if you will end the war. Darkness. Death. Terrible. Must go home to wet sand. War over. Agreed. We will send you home to your wet sand. Picard to Riker. Bring up the lights in the lab... a bit. Are you better? Better. We mean you no harm. Do you believe me? Yes. Good. It is important that you trust us. Not yet. You are still too arrogant. Too primitive. Come back three centuries. Perhaps then we trust. We understand what you are saying. We will leave you. We will send you home. Riker to Transporter Chief. Pick up the coordinates of the jar in the lab for return to Velara III. Coordinates entered, sir. Riker to bridge. Captain... we're ready to beam it back to the planet. I wish we learnt more about them. In time, Mr. Data. When we're better prepared. I wanted to create a place where living things could thrive, and all the while I was about to destroy the life that is there. Our apologies. And respects. Lt Yar? Coordinates set, sir. Energize. Captain's log, stardate 41464.8. I have declared an indefinite quarantine for Velara III. We are returning to Starbase with the surviving terraformers. Perhaps the lesson we learned from this near-tragedy will prevent it from happening elsewhere. "
S1E19,"Jake! Wait a second. How are you doing? I'm fine. Really. Jake, I'm sorry. Acting Ensign Crusher, report to transporter room eight. It's not your fault. Yeah, I know. I wish both of us were going. I don't know. Only 32 points. Mr. Crusher, respond. I'm on my way, Doctor. I've gotta go. I know. Hey, Wes. Do well for both of us, OK? Alright. Captain's log, stardate 41416.2. We're orbiting Relva VII, where Wesley Crusher is about to be tested for entrance into Starfleet Academy. And to my surprise, I've learned that my friend Admiral Gregory Quinn is on Relva VII, and has requested to be beamed aboard the Enterprise immediately. Welcome aboard, Admiral. Thank you. Capt Jean-Luc Picard, Lt Cmdr Dexter Remmick. Sir. And my staff, First Officer William Riker, Chief Medical Officer Beverly Crusher, Chief of Security Natasha Yar. What can we do for you? I need to speak with you. Certainly. This way. Number One? Alone. Is this a personal matter? Official business. My First Officer should... Alone, Captain. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Cmdr Remmick is with the Inspector General's Office. He'll conduct a full investigation of the Enterprise. What are you looking for? I have reason to believe there may be something wrong on this ship. Tell me what you suspect. It's inappropriate to discuss it now. Mr. Remmick, Starfleet is counting on you. You will find out what is wrong on this ship. Yes, sir. Nothing and no one will stand in my way. And you, Captain, are ordered to cooperate in every way necessary. Is that clear? Yes, sir. Mr. Remmick, any questions? No questions, sir. Get on with your duties. Yes, sir. We've known one another for years. Tell me what you believe is wrong. Captain, it is vitally important that my orders be followed exactly. I'll be staying on the ship. As you wish, Admiral. What is it? What? The unit you just put down. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. A flux coordinating sensor unit. I'm Oliana Mirren, another finalist. You must be Wesley Crusher. Yeah. Do you know me? I heard there was a very smart, very young man who'd be tough competition. You wouldn't be here... If I weren't smart. I know. But there's a lot more to it than that. You're lucky. You've had experience aboard the Enterprise. T'Shanik of Vulcana Regar. Wesley Crusher of the Enterprise. You do not look as if you meet the age requirements. I'll be 16 next month. Happy birthday! Excuse me. I'm Wesley Crusher. Mordock. The Mordock? The Benzite who constructed the Mordock Strategy? I thought you were in the Academy. No. Only a hopeful. Like you. Finalists, please take your seats. Thanks. I'm Tac Officer Chang. Welcome. You are here because you are all top candidates. Only one student will be chosen for the Academy. You've shown in preliminary testing that any of you could easily qualify. This may be the most difficult, exhausting experience of your life. And the most exciting challenge. Expect the unexpected. May you all do your best. May I help you, Mr. Remmick? Keep doing whatever it is you're doing. There's nothing much to see here, Commander. We're in a standard orbit. The station has to be manned even if it's just routine. Something I can help you with? When I'm ready, I'll want to speak with you. Privately. Commander, just having that guy around makes me feel guilty. What's he after, anyway? I don't know. But I'm gonna find out. Now. Come. Captain, may I speak frankly? Always, Number One. As First Officer, I should know what you know. That's right. Then what's this about? Remmick's gonna turn this ship upside down. That's his job. My job is to see that this ship runs smoothly. Which you do very well. Sir, am I under investigation? I don't know. And if you did? I couldn't tell you. I don't understand, sir. This is extremely frustrating. No less for me. But I promised cooperation and we shall give it. Sir. I want answers, now. Later. You are ordered to cooperate. Not now! When it doesn't interfere with my duties. Last question on the hyperspace physics test. The matter and antimatter tanks on a Galaxy-class starship are nine-tenths depleted. Calculate the intermix ratio necessary to reach a starbase 100 light years away at warp factor eight. Begin. Time elapsed. You now have one hour free before the next test. I must admit, Wesley, you have a very fast mind. It was a trick question, with only one answer. Yes, there is only one ratio with matter/antimatter. One to one. You both don't know how lucky you are. I can't imagine what it would be like to have things come so easily. I have to push all the way. No, Oliana. It doesn't come that easily. I have to study all the time. It's a good thing you're cute, or you'd really be obnoxious. See you later! Did you hear what she said, Mordock? She said I was cute. Is that good, Wesley? Yes! I think. I should apologize, Captain. No need. Mr. Remmick's presence is unnerving. Are you available now, Mr. Riker? Or do you still have duties to perform? I'm available, Mr. Remmick. Any problem with using your ready room? No, Mr. Remmick. Be my guest. If you prefer to stand, fine, Mr. Riker. It won't have an effect on the length of my inquiry. Now... there are several seeming discrepancies in the Captain's log. Let's go over them one by one. The Captain's log? Yes. To your knowledge, has the Captain ever falsified a log? Have you asked him? Right now, I'm asking you. If you want to discuss Capt Picard, ask him face to face. You must answer my questions, unless you're covering something up. Now... there are several discrepancies in the Captain's log. Shall we go over them one by one? Proceed. You are saying Capt Picard had no control over this vessel. He handed it over to Kosinski, who took it to the edge of the universe. No, sir, that's not what I'm saying. Kosinski was sent by Starfleet to improve our warp drive. According to his own logs, his bridge crew didn't think highly of Kosinski's theories, yet the Captain gave him access to the engines. True, La Forge? Not exactly. One way or the other, Picard lost control of this ship. Is that true? Yes, but that's not how it happened. So, the answer is yes. Is the Captain emotionally and psychologically fit for command? Nothing in his history or personality to suggest... mental lapses? Nothing. Not even the Ferengi incident on his old starship, the Stargazer? He was being controlled by a mind-altering machine. Without his knowledge. I would call that a mental lapse. Ensign, what are you doing on the holodeck? I thought you were on Relva VII. I'm finished testing for the day. I've disturbed you. I'll leave. Wait. I thought I wanted to be alone. I guess I don't. How is the testing? OK, so far. It's not the ones I've studied for I'm worried about. It's the psych test. Facing my deepest fear. I'm trying to decide what images to bring up. Why? I guess I want to scare myself. What do you think? Bulgallian rats? Lightning storms? Do those things frighten you? Sort of, I guess. The psych test is no more or less important than the rest. So they said. But I can't stop thinking about it. Thinking about what you can't control only wastes energy and creates its own enemy. How can they know what my deepest fear is when I don't? By analyzing your psychological profile. They were accurate about everyone I tested with. Including myself. You? I thought nothing could frighten a Klingon warrior. Only fools have no fear. I'm sorry. I'm asking too many personal questions. It is very difficult for me to depend on anyone for anything. But especially for my life. On the Enterprise, you do that every day. Everyone depends on everyone else to protect them. Yes. So you overcame it? No! It is still my enemy. We can eliminate three bulky machines from cargo space. Excellent, Number One. Captain. Unauthorized entry in main shuttle bay. Unauthorized? Who is it, Lieutenant? Computer reads ID of Jake Kurland. Bridge to main shuttle bay. Mr. Kurland, Lt Yar. Respond. Isn't that area secured? Not now, Remmick! He'll take this out. Locking the doors. Too late. He's using the emergency override. Smart kid! Kid? He's launching. On viewer. Lt Yar, open channel. Enterprise to shuttlecraft. Mr. Kurland, this is Capt Picard. Captain, I'm going to Beltane IX to sign on to a freighter. Tell my father... I'm sorry. You can tell him yourself. In person. Bring that ship back at once. No. I can't face him. I'm leaving. He's unbalanced the dilithium reaction. I've lost power! All he's got are maneuvering jets. He'll enter the atmosphere and burn up at an altitude of 200 kilometers. Probable impact? Atmospheric entry 78 seconds. Options? Tractor beam? No. He's too far away for a positive lock. He's out of transporter range. You are completely responsible for his life. Either get out of my way and keep quiet, or I will have you removed from the bridge. Viewer on shuttle cockpit. Visual on main viewer. I can't get the engine started! What am I gonna do? I'm gonna crash! He needs another 50 seconds for the core to cool down. Stay calm, Jake. We'll get you back. Please... Help me! It's no use, Captain. I'm gonna die out here. In 30 seconds he can restart. Irrelevant, sir. A restart will not give enough thrust to escape impact. Mr. Kurland, you will not die out there. You will do exactly what I tell you. Aim the nose of the shuttlecraft directly at Relva VII. Aim it at Relva? I can't! That's crazy! Do it! But I'll burn up! 28 seconds to impact. Listen carefully. This is Capt Picard and I'm giving you an order. Aim the shuttle at Relva! OK. It's done. Good. Now, monitor your speed exactly. When it hits point 020, I want you to restart the engine. And when I tell you, pull up hard! Point 020 speed. Captain... I sure hope you're right. Youll just have to trust me. Point 003. 009. 012. Six seconds to impact. Hold on, Jake. It'll be bumpy. 015. 019. Restart the engine now! Pull up hard! Yeah! Incredible! How did he do it? He built up speed and bounced her off the atmosphere. Mr. Kurland, I assume you can maneuver it home? Yes, sir. Do it. Then report to Mr. Riker. Yes, sir. Very... original, Captain. But how did that child acquire access to a shuttlecraft? He's a highly qualified Academy candidate, trained in many areas, including shuttles. Did this full training include discipline? Mr. Remmick, young men sometimes make rash choices. Mr. Kurland will receive a strong refresher, specifically in discipline. I'll note that in my report. Full cooperation, Number One. You. I have a package for Operations. Where is it? End of the corridor, on your right. 104. Excuse me. You blocked my path! You Bulgallian sludge rat! I'm sorry. It was an honest mistake. I apologize. Is there a problem, gentlemen? No, sir. How dare you! I am Rondon! You despicable Melanoid slimeworm! Liar! Who do you think you're bullying? You bumped into me! It was your mistake! You were at fault! Do you want this to become violent? Friend. I like you. A very strange reaction. Not really. I saw his hand was webbed. The sign of a Zaldan. But you became hostile. Zaldans are infuriated by courtesy. They view it as a phoney social behavior covering true feelings. Congratulations, Mr. Crusher. You handled that particular incident very well. Was this incident deliberate? It's important to know how you candidates deal with other cultures. Other species. Then it was a test. Yes. Not all tests are announced, or what they appear to be. Zaldans have webbed fingers. I wouldn't have passed. You're an android? Yes, sir. You are programmed to tell the entire truth? There is a problem with this ship, Mr. Data. It's in the records. Somewhere. I need your help to find it. All the records are available to you, sir. But this information is very cleverly hidden. Your Captain is not what he appears to be. Do not forget that you have loyalty to Starfleet above all else. Loyalty is not the issue, Commander. There is nothing wrong with Capt Picard, or the ship's logs. There must be something wrong with your assumption. That is not acceptable, Mr. Data. Acceptable or not, sir... it is the truth. Just how did this contaminant get aboard this ship? By accident, sir. Meaning Capt Picard has no standing procedure for this type of situation? No. Meaning by accident... sir. You don't like me very much, do you? Is it required, sir? How would you characterize your relationship with Capt Picard? We're Starfleet officers who've known each other for many years. Everything said here is confidential, Doctor. You can be completely open with me. About what? About how you feel serving with a man who is responsible for the death of your husband. My personal feelings about Capt Picard are irrelevant to this investigation, and none of your business. Then you confirm the accuracy of the log report. You violated the Prime Directive of the Edo. You interfered with their laws! Yes. It is exactly as I explained it in the log records. All to save Dr Crusher's son. A crew member was being held unjustly. I stand by my decision. You've talked to every member of this ship. You've had enough time to find whatever you're looking for. Are you afraid, if I keep looking, I'll find that you're guilty? All I'm guilty of is allowing this charade to go on so long. Admiral, if it is me you're investigating, ask me directly what you want to know. And please tell me what is going on. I need a little more time. How much? I won't tolerate my crew being harassed any longer. Remmick's full report is almost ready. I want to hear him present it. That is my intention. Cmdr Remmick, report to Admiral Quinn. On my way, sir. This has been a strain on our friendship. I know. Believe me, Jean-Luc, I regret that. But it has been necessary. I can't get it! Yes, you can. Don't fight it. Relax into it and let it come by itself. No, it's going too fast! I can't do it. You've got your rotation factor. Just put in your vector coordinates. Time elapsed. Congratulations, Mordock. That was the second-fastest time ever recorded on this test. You all did well. No. It should not have been that way. Mr. Crusher helped me. Yes. I know. An interesting choice, Mr. Crusher. Especially given how close you and Mr. Mordock are in overall score. You all have an hour to prepare for your last test. The psych test, sir? We prefer to think of it as a psychological evaluation based on reactions to various individual problems. But... psych test will do. Sir? Please sit down, Mr. Remmick. Proceed with your report. Admiral, I've done my best to be thorough in this investigation. Continue. I couldn't find what you asked for, sir. I spoke to officer after officer at length, I pried into the ship's logs. Yet I found nothing wrong. Except, perhaps, a casual familiarity among the bridge crew, but... ...mostly, that comes from a sense of teamwork. And a feeling of family. I'm sorry, sir. I did my best. Quite. You're dismissed, Commander. Yes, sir. My tour in the Inspector General's Office will be up in six months. When I'm finished... ...this is where I'd like to serve, sir. Don't judge the young man too harshly. He's a good officer. It's not him I'm inclined to judge. Don't judge me too harshly either, until I've finished. We had to be very sure of you. Some of us at Starfleet Command became suspicious of certain problems in the Federation. What problems? Someone or something is trying to destroy everything we've built up in the last 200 years. What's your evidence? I can't say. Too many people are involved. What do you want from me? I don't know if the threat comes from the inside or the outside. I need people I can trust in strong positions in the Federation. You have my complete support. That's not enough. I want to promote you to Admiral. And I want you to take over as Commandant of Starfleet Academy. The Academy? Yes. The Academy? I need you close. Then there was never a problem with the Enterprise? No. But I had to be sure you hadn't been coopted. Greg... ...this is... politics. And... I... I'm not good at politics. Surely there are others who are... better suited. Alright, even if I am wrong, and I hope I am, you're still the best man for the job. I appreciate the value of what you're offering. It's not a decision I can make quickly. I need an answer soon. Alright. You'll have it tonight, Admiral. Thank you. Mr. Mordock will be finished with his psych test momentarily. Are you alright? I will be. You're next. Good luck. I'm here. I'm ready. Maybe they forgot. Breathe. Gotta remember to breathe. Evacuate immediately. 65 seconds to seal-off. Somebody help! Something's wrong in the environmental lab! Help! We're trapped! I can't move! Please, help me! We're gonna die in here! The liquid hydrogen's gonna blow! The shut-off valve ruptured! Hurry up! My legs are crushed! You gotta help me! Give me a hand! We're gonna die! Help me! I can't! It's too late! 30 seconds to seal-off. Come on! If we don't get out, they'll seal us in to contain the explosion! Come on! You're not hurt! I can't go through that! Yes, you can! You've got to! 20 seconds to seal-off. Come on! I can't carry you both! You're not hurt! Ten seconds to seal-off. It's too late! I'm sorry... Officer Chang, there's... Wesley. It's alright. Thanks. An excellent performance, Mr. Crusher. Performance? That was the test? Yes. A man could have died. Theoretically, yes. You had to make a choice. And you did. There's no right or wrong about it. Your greatest fear has been that you couldn't make that decision. Because of my father? Because Cap... Because someone made that choice... ...and my father died. Sir. Yes, Number One? Mr. Remmick has left the ship. Yes. He found nothing wrong on the Enterprise. You can inform the crew that Admiral Quinn is most impressed. Thank you. They'll be pleased to hear that. So what was he after? They were after me, Number One. They want me to take over as Commandant, Starfleet Academy. Congratulations! What a wonderful choice, sir. You'll shape the minds of the future leaders of Starfleet. You haven't decided what you'll do. Yes, I have, Number One. I've decided I'm going for a walk. I'm proud of all of you. You've done a superb job. Each of you would make a fine Starfleet officer. It's unfair that only one candidate will attend the Academy this year. And a loss to the Federation if the rest of you do not return to test again. Mr. Mordock will be the candidate. His results were slightly higher than Mr. Crusher's. Congratulations, Mr. Mordock. You're the first Benzite in Starfleet. Thank you, sir. But it's not right. It shouldn't be me. Wesley lost points because he helped me. He should not be punished for generosity. He wasn't. He lost time, but it wasn't only that. Candidates... thank you. And good luck. I am sorry, Wesley. It's OK. You deserved to win. Besides, you'd do the same for me. Yes. I believe I would. Congratulations. Well, personally, I hate losing. So be ready next year, Wesley. I won't be easy to beat! Yes, sir. Are you... ...feeling better? Yes, sir. I'm sorry I damaged the shuttle, Captain. Mr. Riker said I can help fix it as part of discipline training. I hope you learned that running away solves nothing. Yes, sir. And I am sorry I messed up. You kept your wits about you. Don't forget that. No, sir. And thank you. Thank you for... saving my life. That's my job, young man. Yes, sir. Why aren't you in your dress uniform for Admiral Quinn's farewell dinner? I didn't think it appropriate, sir. Why not? I failed. I didn't get into the Academy. I failed you and I failed the Enterprise. Ridiculous. Did you do your best? Yes. When you test next year, do you think your performance will improve? Yes. Good. The only person you're truly competing against is yourself. Then you're not disappointed? You have to measure your successes and your failures within, not by anything that I or anyone else might think. But... ...if it helps you to know this... ...I failed the first time. And you may not tell anyone. You? You failed? Yes. But not the second time! Now, you'll do me the courtesy of joining us at dinner. I have to disappoint an old friend. Wish I could convince you to change your mind. I'll serve you better here. This is where you belong. If you should need me... I've been playing politics too long. Perhaps I see conspiracies everywhere. Don't worry. Safe travels, my friend. Set course for Algeron IV. Course plotted and laid in, sir. Shall we continue with our mission? Yes, sir. Excellent. Engage. "
S1E20,"Captain, Starfleet have reported a disturbance in the Neutral Zone. Of what nature? A battle. Quadrant nine, coordinates 070, mark three. There's no information who was involved. They ask if we can investigate. Answer yes. Mr. La Forge, lay in the course. Aye, sir. No reports of any Federation vessels in that area. Ferengi? Out of their territory. Shall we separate the saucer? Let's get more information first. Course set, Captain. Speed, warp seven. Aye, sir, warp seven. Engage. We are now approaching the Neutral Zone. Sir, sensors indicate recent photon explosions and phaser activity. I've analyzed the explosions' residue. This is of no known Ferengi design. It is possibly Romulan. There's a name we haven't heard for a while. I could go longer without hearing it. If they have returned to this sector, we should know. Mr. Worf, any further activity? Negative, sir. Slow to half impulse. Going to one-half impulse. Now entering quadrant 907, mark three. Shields and deflectors up. Go to yellow alert. I have located a vessel, sir. It is drifting. Put it on main viewer. Aye, sir. Magnify. Their life-support systems are failing. Propulsion, navigation, and all communication inoperative. Any trace of the other vessel? No, sir. If it is Romulan it could be cloaked. Tell Starfleet we're entering the Neutral Zone. Yes, sir. Mr. La Forge, take us in closer. Aye, sir. Stay sharp, everyone. It's Talarian. Life signs? Nothing yet, sir. I have identified the vessel. The Batris, a general cargo vessel. A long way from home. Keep alert. Captain, possible life signs. What do you mean, ""possible""? The readings emanate from what's left of Main Engineering. Radioactive clutter is making positive determination difficult. I'll prepare an away team. Lt Yar, stay at your post. If this is the result of a Romulan attack, they may still be in the area. Aye, sir. Data, Geordi, let's go. Mr. La Forge, are we close enough to use a Visual Acuity Transmitter? We can certainly try it, sir. Please do. And, Number One...? Everything about this seems wrong. Agreed. It smells like a trap. Let's go. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 41503. 7. We have entered the Neutral Zone, where a Talarian freighter has been severely damaged in battle. I have sent an away team to investigate. What exactly does this device do? We've been working on a way to transmit what my visor sees. If it works, the bridge will be able to monitor us. It has restrictions. The information from Geordi's visor is difficult to encode. The signal breaks down easily. So not much range? Exactly. The effective range is only a few kilometers, but we're working on it. La Forge to bridge. This is the bridge. Worf, I've switched on the transmitter. We are receiving. The signal is strong. OK, Worf, I'm switching off for transport. Set phasers on stun. Let's be ready for anything. Energize. La Forge to bridge. This is the Enterprise. Captain, I'm switching on the transmitter. Ready to receive. On main viewer. Aye, sir. Extraordinary! Now I'm beginning to understand him. Geordi, what's that? Over to the left. What? Yes, that. No, no, back. Yes, that. Right there. What is that? That's Cmdr Riker. To me it's just an undefined form standing in a... visual frenzy. Can you... filter out the extraneous information? No, I get it all simultaneously. But it's... just a jumble. How can you make head or tail of that? I select what I want and then... disregard the rest. But how is that possible? How, in a noisy room, can you select one specific voice or sound? Of course, something you learn. Exactly. It's something I've learned. Does that make it more clear? Look over at Data. There's an aura around him. Well, of course, he's an android. You say that as if you think that's what we all see. Don't you? Sir, I hate to break this up, but... Yes, of course, Number One. Proceed. Let's go. I am detecting high levels of deuterium gas, probably from leakage in the drive system. Toxic? Not as yet, sir. The life signs are emanating from the far side of Engineering. What's the safest way around? All routes are equally dangerous. What's the least dangerous? There is no significant difference. Steady on. Cmdr Riker! Commander! Yes, Geordi? There's a fissure in the bulkhead. The skin of the ship is losing its integrity. Where is it? I can't see it. Right there. Geordi, step closer. It looks to me like a spectrograph indicating metal fatigue. Is that how you interpret it? Very good, Captain. Exactly right. How long before this hull ruptures? It's impossible to be exact. I'd say five minutes. Probably less. Let's go. Geordi, we've lost transmission. Signal overload. I'm surprised it lasted this long. We've reached the core, Captain. The life signs are very strong, sir. They are coming from over there. Is there any other way around? Negative. This is the only way. The safest way to proceed is for me to cross alone. The heat and toxic gases have less effect on me. Agreed. Captain, Data's gone ahead. The life signs are from the far side of Engineering. I've found them, sir. The door to their compartment is jammed. The control mechanism's not operative, sir. This is Cmdr Riker of the USS Enterprise. Do you hear me? I advise against the use of phasers. The gas build-up is too great. A phaser discharge now could blow us all outta here. Shall I, sir? What's going on? We're about to force the door. What is it? What do you see? Klingons. Klingons? I am Korris. We'll handle the formalities later. We have to get off this ship. Are there any other survivors? No. I believe I've found a quicker way out of here, sir. Check him out. He is alive, sir, but just barely. Then pick up the body and let's go. No! I will carry him. As you wish. Come on, let's go! Tasha, go to transporter room three. I want you there when the away team returns. Aye, sir. Commander, we are out of time! This ship is blowing! Transporter room, have you got a lock on us? Too much interference. Get further away from Engineering. Sir, Engineering is critical. Destruction is imminent. There are no options! Do it! Now! Bridge, this is Cmdr Riker. We are taking the survivors to sickbay. I'll be in sickbay. Request permission to join you. Granted. The debris is still being analyzed. Inform me when it's completed. Aye, sir. Situation, Doctor? His injuries are very critical. I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of this vessel. I am Korris, Captain of the Klingon Defense Force. This is Lt Konmel. Would you mind telling me what has happened? We were passengers. The Talarians were taking us to Outpost MZ5. What was the vessel doing in the Neutral Zone? We were attacked without warning by a Ferengi cruiser. During battle we must have entered the Neutral Zone. The weapons were not Ferengi. What is your name? I am Lt Worf. And you are a member of this crew? Yes. You are correct. The weapons were Klingon, but the vessel was Ferengi. What precipitated the attack? I don't know. We were in quarters. The Captain of the freighter had no combat experience, so did not anticipate the first attack, which was nearly fatal. We took control with his permission. The Ferengi called for surrender. I told the Captain to agree to all their terms. We had only one chance, but I was confident that it would be enough. As adversaries the Ferengi are not very worthy. Still, your weapons were limited and their vessel superior. Yes. All we had was a battery of ancient Merculite rockets. Our only chance was to trick them into lowering their shields. We reduced power and lured them in. They suspected nothing. When they lowered their shields to beam over a boarding party, we opened fire. There are some points that I'm not clear about. Captain... we are hungry and tired. Of course. If there is anything else you wish to know, we will be available. Permission to show our guests to their quarters, Captain. Permission granted. What do you think, Captain? There's more to this than we've been told. Why was that Talarian ship so far off course? What was its point of departure? Why would Klingon officers hitch a ride on a broken-down freighter? Find out what Starfleet knows about Korris and company. It'll take 48 hours for a message to get to Starfleet. They'll be here for a while. Let's find out all we can about them. Should I have assigned a security team to keep an eye on them? No. Worf can deal with anything that might arise. How's your patient, Doctor? Not good. I'll keep you posted. Sit, friend. Let us eat. I did not know there were Klingons serving on human Starfleet vessels. As far as I know, I am the only one. Tell me, what is it like for the hunter to lie down with the prey? Have they tamed you? Or have you always been docile? Does it make you gentle? Is your heart filled with peace? Do glorious battles no longer inspire your dreams? Why do you mock me? Why do you wish to anger me? Only to see if it is still possible. It is. Dr Crusher! You'd better come and look at this. His condition is worsening. He's convulsing. Get the hypospray! Cmdr Korris, this is Capt Picard. Yes, Captain? I'm sorry to report your comrade's injuries are beyond our medical abilities. He's dying. Is there any special arrangement you would like for the body? It is only an empty shell now. Please, treat it as such. Kunivas's killer should have been an enemy, then his death would have been more glorious. If the opponent was not an enemy, who was it? Tell me. What really happened? I do not wish to anger you. We are, after all, brothers lost among infidels. Tell me, how is it that you come to this ship? That uniform? Through an act of kindness. The Romulans attacked the Khitomer outpost. Everyone was killed. I was buried under the rubble and left for dead. A human Starfleet officer found me. He took me to his home on Gault and told his wife to raise me as his son. How old were you? Before the Age of Inclusion. That young? Gault is a farming colony! When my foster brother and I were of age, we entered Starfleet Academy. He hated it and returned to Gault. I stayed. You haven't spent much time among your own kind. Hardly none. So, when the night was still and quiet, and the sound of the blood in your veins filled your ears, the only way to silence it was to slip out into the night, and like the hunter that spawned you, join in the struggle of life and death. You were unable... The others did not understand. You frightened them. They shunned you. Cursed you, called you vile names, and you knew not why. Even now, do you know why you are driven? Why you cannot relent, or repent, or confess, or abstain? How could you know? There have been no other Klingons to lead you to that knowledge. Yes. Yes, those feelings are still a part of me. But I control them. They do not rule me. Yes. To fit in, the humans demand that you change the one thing that you cannot change. But because you cannot, you do. That too is the mark of a warrior. You said I mock you. I do not. I salute you! Against whom do you test yourself? What enemy do you battle? I have been in battle. Then, you understand. Yes, I do. Brother, this ""peace,"" this ""Alliance,"" is like a living death to warriors like us. You're right, we lied to your Commander. We commandeered that freighter and left the crew behind. We were in search of a place where we can live like true Klingons! You did not battle the Ferengi? It was one of our own cruisers sent to bring us back. You destroyed a Klingon vessel?! I did not want to battle our brothers. I had no choice. They had been corrupted by the illusion of peace. They traded our birthright so they could die in their sleep. A peace that makes the Klingon heart that beats within my chest wither and die! Is it permitted for you to show us around this ship? Yes, of course. And as I watched Worf... ...it was like looking at a man that I had never known. Captain, long-range sensors indicate another vessel approaching. Can you identify it? No, sir, not yet. Keep a close watch on it. So close to the Neutral Zone it can't be random. Let's look at that sensory data. What magnificent battles we could have at the helm of this ship. Perhaps your dreams of glory no longer fit the time. They belong buried with the past. Standing here we will never know. Our answer lies out there. Our instincts will lead us. Instincts not dulled by living among civilized men. I believe, sir, that was the first time outsiders have witnessed the Klingon death ritual. I can understand them looking at a dying man's eyes, but the howling? It was a warning. To who? They're warning the dead, sir. ""Beware, a Klingon warrior is about to arrive."" Captain, that unidentified vessel is approaching us at warp five. Intersect one hour, 16 minutes, 33 seconds. Can we get a visual? I can try, sir. Magnify. Hello. Klingons. Open hailing frequencies, Lt Yar. Hailing frequencies open. Klingon cruiser, this is Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise. I am Cmdr K'nera. What is your purpose in this area? We came to investigate a battle. We rescued three Klingon survivors. That is all that is left of the crew of the cruiser T'Acog? They're from the freighter Batris. Their leader is Capt Korris. You have him on your ship? He is alive? Yes. He is a criminal. A renegade, who with two others stole that freighter and destroyed the Klingon cruiser sent to bring them back. We expect the criminals to be delivered into our custody as soon as we are within transporter range. Lt Yar, where are they now? They're with Worf on deck 17. Deck 17? Yes. Near the battle-bridge lift. Shall I alert Lt Worf? No, send a security team. Worf wouldn't allow them on the battle bridge. I think we cannot assume anything. Shall I remain at my tactical position or lead the team? Lead the team. And, Lieutenant... you understand with whom you're dealing? Aye, sir. We have heard this ship can separate in time of battle. Yes. When relieved of its bulk the Enterprise becomes an exceptional weapon. They have come for us. Step aside. What is the problem? The Captain wants those two taken into custody. Do not let them take us, Worf. Help us. Listen to the voice of your blood. You are not of these people. Yes. Join us. Go back! Please, turn around and go back to your mother. Bridge, we have a hostage situation on deck 17. Mommy! Bridge, this is Lt Yar. Disregard. Situation is under control. By order of the Captain, you are confined to Security. I thought for a minute we had a problem. Yes. It looked like Korris was going to hold that girl hostage. That is not our way. Cowards take hostages, Klingons do not. Lieutenant. The Klingon vessel has arrived. They request the return of the renegades. They will be tried and executed. I know. Lieutenant, I am not unmindful of the mixed feelings you must have about this incident. Thank you, sir. Are there no other options, sir? None that I can see. He seems to be handling this well. So far. He must be torn. These are his people. The Klingon vessel is within range. They're requesting visual contact. Open frequencies. Hailing frequencies open, sir. We are in position now to receive the criminals. We're prepared to transfer. Captain. Request permission to address the Captain on the Klingon vessel. I know it is against procedure, but there is something I must say. Permission granted. What is it you want? To plead. You waste your time. Their actions threaten the Alliance. They disobeyed and must be punished. Yes, they must be punished... but not executed with dishonor. Why do you care? What burns in their eyes... fires my soul. I hear their words and I see it all as it was. Part of me longs for that time. It's bred in the bone. We all do. Then send them to a planet in the Halee system where they can meet death on their feet with a weapon in hand, not tied and helpless. When one of us dies that way, it diminishes us all. Yes. Brother, I feel as you. I too wish they could fly free, but I have no choice. Sir. We await the transfer. Lt Yar, escort the prisoners to the transporter room. Aye, sir. This is Ramos. Force field in Security three has been broken. Lt Yar to bridge. There's been an escape. At least one of my security is dead. So is Konmel. Korris is loose and armed. Keep me informed. Aye, sir. Data, visual on K'nera. Visual on, sir. Captain, there will be a short delay. Korris has escaped. He is a trained Klingon warrior, Captain. Perhaps more than you can handle. It is not a disgrace to request our assistance. I think we can handle the situation. What?! Keep down! He's up there! Captain, Korris is in Main Engineering. Capt Korris, this is a futile attempt. You cannot win. I will speak only to my countryman! Only to Worf! Captain, he has a phaser aimed at the dilithium crystal chamber. At that range one blast and... I understand, Lieutenant. Captain... permission to leave the bridge. We'll both go. What's the situation? He's armed with a phaser. We do not have a clear field of fire. How do you suggest we proceed? Wait him out. Captain, let me talk to him. I do not think that's a good idea. He's running on adrenaline. Let it cool. He can't go anywhere. He will wait only as long as he believes it's to his advantage. The moment it is not, he will fire into the dilithium crystal chamber. That would destroy the Enterprise and him. Yes. He knows. Talk to him, Worf. Brother! I knew you would come. Now I... We have a chance! I could not do it alone. But I would rather die here than let the traitors of Kling pick the meat from my bones! With you... it will work. What will work? We will demand Capt Picard give us access to the battle bridge. We will separate from the rest of the ship, then together we will light up the galaxy! Imagine the fear that will roll before us! Capt Picard will not comply. He cannot... dare not refuse us! To save themselves they will give us what we demand. Then, brother, we are free! Put down the phaser. Wait. I do not believe this. Believe it! I have tasted your heart! You have been with them, but you are still of us! Do not deny the challenge of your destiny. Get off your knees and soar! Open your eyes and let the dream take flight! My brother, it is you who does not see. You look for battles in the wrong place. The true test of a warrior is not without, it is within. Here! Here is where we meet the challenge! It is the weaknesses in here a warrior must overcome. No. You have talked of glory and of conquest, and legends we will write. Yes. The birthright of every Klingon. Yet in all you say, where are the words ""duty,"" ""honor,"" ""loyalty""? Without which a warrior is nothing! What are you saying? Living among these humans has sucked the Klingon heart out of you. Put down the phaser. You are a sham! My words were dust upon the ground! Your blood has no fire! You are weak, like them! I don't care what you look like, you are no Klingon! Perhaps not. Wait! La Forge, open hailing frequencies. Hailing frequencies open. K'nera, this is Capt Picard. Yes, Captain? Korris and the other Klingon are dead. May I speak with Lt Worf? Yes, Commander? How did they die? They died well. Do you wish the bodies returned? They are now only empty shells. Dispose of them as you see fit. When your tour of duty on the Enterprise is complete, consider serving with us. Your training and experience would benefit us. And perhaps there are some things we could teach you. I am honored. Thank you. I was just being polite, sir. Commendable, Lieutenant. Mr. La Forge, set course for Starbase 84. Aye, sir. Really... I have no desire to leave the Enterprise. Good. Coordinates set in, Captain. Speed... warp five. Aye, sir, warp five. And, Mr. Worf... ...the bridge wouldn't be the same without you. Engage. "
S1E21,"Captain's log, stardate 41798.2. We have been ordered by Starfleet to the Lorenze Cluster to investigate the disappearance of a light cruiser, USS Drake, which was there trying to unravel a mystery of its own. This began when recent long-range probes indicated that all intelligent life on the planet Minos had disappeared. Number One? Nothing. The Drake arrived at Minos, then wasn't heard of again. Mr. Data? Citizens of Minos gained fame during the Erselrope Wars as arms merchants. They manufactured highly advanced weaponry. Yeah? For which side? Both. We are approaching the planet Minos, sir. Standard orbit, Mr. La Forge. Aye, sir, standard orbit. What happened to the Drake happened quickly, or Rice would've reported again. You know him? From the Academy. Tell me more. Able. Good officer. How would he react under stress? Rice is confident to the point of arrogance, but he's usually right. A risk taker. Really. Here's an example. A final test in Advanced Navigation at the Academy provides the students with three options. Rice rejected their options and offered one of his own. That's taking a risk. He got the top grade, and now that test has four options. In a difficulty, such a man would act aggressively. Agreed. Commander, weren't you offered the Drake? Yes. You gave up your own command for this assignment? I thought it would be more advantageous to do a tour here. Captain, readings correspond with the probe's findings. No signs of intelligent life forms. Vegetation and animal life only. What happened to all the people? War? Disease? A dissatisfied customer? In every war, natural disaster, even the most virulent plague, there are always survivors. We are being hailed. How can that be from an uninhabited planet? Sensors indicated no intelligent life forms? Correct, sir. Something has scanned our language banks and is hailing us. On main viewer. Whoever you are, wherever you're from, greetings. Welcome to Minos, the arsenal of freedom. I'm Capt Jean-Luc Picard of... If you need a little something special, be it for one target or multiple targets, we got it. You'll see it here on Minos, where we live by the motto ""Peace through superior firepower."" Who are you? To be totally armed is to be totally secure. Remember, the early bird that hesitates gets wormed. A recorded message, sir. Minos, the arsenal of freedom. Perfection in advanced weaponry. Versatility... We've triggered something left from the Erselrope Wars when the arms business was booming. So lock on to my signal and beam on down, because we dont just provide weapons. Shut that off. We provide complete weapons sys... It's a heck of a sales pitch. If an automatic message system is functioning, other systems could be still operational. Weapons? Possibly. We must go down. Prepare an away team. Lt Yar. Data. I recommend a minimum complement. I would've thought otherwise. We keep the first party small and mobile until I'm confident whatever killed the inhabitants isn't still there. OK. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, supplemental. An away team is on Minos to investigate the disappearance of the Drake. Although there are no signs of intelligent life from this planet, I'm far from certain that it is devoid of danger. Spooky. Riker. This is the bridge. We'll start a pattern search from this point. Keep this channel open. Aye, sir. Commander, our communications are being monitored. By whom? Since there is no intelligent life... the question is by what? Captain. We heard, Number One. We'll try and track it down from here. Tritanium. It's melted. What could do that? I don't know, but it's beyond our technology. Over here. Wow. Never seen anything like this. It's undamaged. Maybe a demonstration model for some potential buyer. Maybe... Let's spread out a little. Commander Riker, this is Ensign T'Su. I'm monitoring a slight energy build-up near your position. I can't pinpoint the source. Give me a direction. East of your position, ten meters. I will continue monitoring. I can't see anything through here. The underbrush is too thick. Hello. Commander Riker. Rice! Where did you come from? I was over there. We were worried. I should've known you'd pop up. How are you, Cmdr Riker? What about you? No word, nothing. How many are with you? Two others. Where's the Drake? Number One, a word. We have some information you should be aware of. Ensign T'Su? Sensors indicate low-level energy readings, but the only life signs are your team's. You copy, Number One? Understood. You look strange, Paul. I was injured getting here. Do you need medical help? No. What's your purpose here? Cmdr Data. Lt Yar. Sir, other than ourselves I am picking up no life signs here. I know. Riker, you didn't answer me. Who sent you to look for me? Your mother. She's worried about you. Tell me about your ship, Riker. It's the Enterprise, isn't it? No. The name of my ship is the Lollipop. I don't know that ship. It's newly commissioned. It's a good ship. Refresh me, would you, Riker? What's its size, its complement? Who is here with you? What arms are on the Lollipop? Paul, I will only answer your questions if you answer mine. Why do you want to know about my ship? We're friends, aren't we? Old friends. Our top speed is warp three. What's yours? Is? Then the Drake has not been destroyed. The Drake? Yes, your ship. Of course, the Drake. Where is it? Classified. Classified? Please. It's important. Our survival depends on knowing. What's the armament on your ship? Ten. Ten? I don't understand. Ten what? Six. Cmdr Riker, your answers make no sense. You haven't used my first name once, Paul. You remember it, don't you? You don't, do you? Because you don't exist. You're a fake. You're an image of the original, aren't you? Answer me! Report, Number One. The image of Rice has been replaced by something hovering several meters away. Number One, get your team back up here. Prepare to beam up. Commander! What's happened, Number One? Report. He can't answer, Captain. Cmdr Riker has just been encased in some kind of energy field. Is he alive? Unknown. Captain's log, supplemental. A kind of weapon, which for a time took the form of Capt Paul Rice, has enveloped Cmdr Riker. Transporter room, have you locked on to the away team? I am unable to lock on to Cmdr Riker. Ensign T'Su, situation report. Previous energy readings are gone. Data, have you managed to assess Cmdr Riker's condition? He appears to be in some kind of stasis. Theorize, Mr. Data. What would be the purpose of such an encasement? Typically, the purpose of such an enclosure is for storage. Which would suggest what? That someone or something will soon be along to collect him. I'm coming down. Dr Crusher, meet me in transporter room three. Mr. La Forge, you have command. Aye, sir. Whatever happens, your responsibility is to the ship. Understood, sir. Captain, I take exception to you beaming down. Noted. Is it just Riker? Yes. Apparently he's been confined inside some sort of force field. Energize. Any changes? We know what it is. Any life signs? He is alive. What appeared as Capt Rice is an intelligence-gathering device used during the Erselrope Wars. Probably developed here. It projects an image of someone the subject trusts, and gets information. If it's found out, it encases the subject for more detailed interrogation later. Clever. Can you remove it? Possibly, but I need the exact frequency, and I don't know the risk to Cmdr Riker. We have no choice. It's interrupting the transporter beam. Remove it. This will take some time, sir. I am picking up energy readings. Captain, La Forge here. Sensors show energy readings in your area. Doctor, over here! Oh, no! Doctor! This one is different. It's anticipating. Data, I need you. Set your phaser on kill. I'll lead left, you get it. Captain? Dr Crusher? Captain Picard? I have a malfunction. Enterprise, this is Yar. Mine's out too. The weapons must have disrupted our communicators. Keep working. I'll look for the Captain and Dr Crusher. My arm! How bad is it? It's bad. Come on. Alright. Don't worry, we'll get you out of here. Enterprise, this is the Captain. Two to beam up. Enterprise? Enterprise, come in. Data? Lt Yar? Why aren't they working? I don't know. But don't worry. As soon as they realize our communicators are not working the sensors will find us and Geordi will beam us up. Now, just you hold on. I'm sorry about this. Hold on. It won't be long. I must keep conscious. Data... I can't find them. Step back, please. I believe I have found it. Data. All vitals returning to normal. Good. Now Geordi can get us out of here. C'mon. The Captain and Dr Crusher can't be far away. Sir, I'm reading life forms on the planet. All five members of the away team. Good. They must have freed Cmdr Riker. Transporter room, get a lock on the away team, beam them up. Shields just came on. Deflectors also up. I'm picking up an object off the port bow. It's firing. Red alert. Battle stations. We can't beam anyone up with our shields in place. Phasers ready. Photon torpedoes standing by. Locking on target. Correction. Target has disappeared. Give me a full scan. Scanning... Nothing yet. Wait. Something dead astern. Power to shields. Object firing. Return fire! No use. It's gone again. Aft shields weakened. Our shields can't hold stand up much longer. This is Chief Engineer Logan. Are we breaking orbit? I need to know now. Ship's log, supplemental. Lt La Forge in command. I cannot beam up our team due to an attack on the ship. Even worse, Chief Engineer Logan is coming up, and he's not paying a courtesy call. Why are we still in orbit? We have to hold out. If we can disable our attacker, even briefly, we can beam the away team up. If we follow that plan, we'll lose the Enterprise. In view of the present crisis, you should relinquish command to me. No. I outrank you. Mr. Logan, I'm in command. The Captain did not anticipate the Enterprise would be attacked. If he had, would he have left command to you? If he had, he wouldn't have left the ship! An object to starboard, sir, heading toward us. Lock phasers. Fire once it's in range. Locking in... The object has vanished. Phaser lock lost. Starboard shields weakened. It's cloaked itself. You can't beat this thing. We must break orbit now. Worf, analyze its firing pattern. Maybe we can anticipate its location. Aye. Solis, correlate the trajectory of energy bolts with attack path. I'll compute the optimum spread to hit it. Right. Lt La Forge... Geordi... I know you want what's best for the Enterprise. So do I. The best... The best thing, Mr. Logan, is for you to return to your duties. I'm in charge until relieved by Cmdr Riker or Capt Picard. You're ignoring my greater rank and experience. Not at all. In fact, the opposite. I'm counting on it. I need you back in Engineering to get me all the emergency power you can. The more power we get to the shields, the longer we'll be able to hold out. Now, Mr. Logan. Worf, have you got a lock on it yet? It's impossible to be sure. Maybe you should wait here while Data and I search. I'm groggy, but I'll be alright. I'm getting energy readings... Look out! We'll do it just like before. It has a deflector shield. The product continues to upgrade and improve. Concentrate fire to collapse its shield. Commander, we'll need you too. Now! You're right. They keep getting better. The weapons are appearing at intervals of precisely 12 minutes. I don't know how we handle the next one. We're not going to wait around. Let's find the rest of our team. We seem to be in... some kind of underground structure. But I don't see any... No, don't sleep. I'm tired. Come on. Stay with me. C'mon, now, stay awake. That's an order. I must've lost a lot of blood. I've stopped the bleeding. No. There's another wound. My leg. Not to worry. Everything is going to be fine. Now, this is going to hurt a bit. I've heard that before. Doctor, stay awake. Come on. There's a lot of blood. What do I do next? The wound needs a clotting agent. I couldn't find your medical kit. Those roots. What are they? Roots...? What, these? Break off a piece and taste it. Don't swallow it. Very bitter. Apply some to your hand. Is there a color change? It's turning yellowish. Good. Now, spread as much of it as you can onto the wound. Now stay awake. You've got to help me. I need your help. Alright, now, listen, your patient has lost a great deal of blood from multiple lacerations. The patient's going into shock. So, what do I do? Elevate the legs and try to keep her warm. Good. Alright. Stay with me. Keep talking. You didn't happen to bring a blanket, did you? No. I'm going to look for a way out. Now, you keep up your end. Stay awake. Alright, it's risky, but a shot in the dark is better than nothing. Let's see if we can get lucky. I can't seem to pin down the pattern. There. Sorry, sir, I should've seen that. No, you're doing fine. Program laid in. Phasers and photon torpedoes ready. OK. Mr. Solis, bring her about to 23, mark 185. Aye, sir. Fire! Now! Phasers and photons firing. We missed! Number four shield buckling. Number three shield near failure. This is Engineering. I can't hold power level much longer. Do something. Backup systems overloaded. Backup systems failing. La Forge, this is Logan. Tell me something. Mr. Logan, report to the bridge. On my way. Deflectors are breaking down. We have less than one minute of reserve. We're getting out of here. Lt Solis, set course 315, mark 007. Course set. You're leaving them. Speed warp five. Warp five. Aye. Engage. Hold course and speed for 28 seconds, then come to a full stop. Mr. Logan, had we stayed we would have been destroyed. We're carrying over 1,000 people. I have a responsibility to them. What about your responsibility to the away team? I have a responsibility to them as well. Mr. Logan, you are going to take command... of the saucer section. Backup crew to the main bridge. You're separating. Yes. I want you to take the saucer section to Starbase 103. You can't fight what you can't see. You can't see that thing. Maybe we won't have to. Risky. Yes. That's why we're going to separate. Worf, Solis, T'Su, to the battle bridge. I'll join you in a moment. Secure connector levels. Aye, sir. Come in. Lieutenant, I need to speak to you. We're about to separate. I don't have much time. I know, but as Counselor, I must evaluate the emotional fitness of the crew. And you sense I'm nervous. Well, you're right. Counselor, deep down I'm shaking. We're going into battle, and there's a good chance we'll be blasted to pieces. I'm taking a huge risk, and many lives are at stake. So, yeah, I'm nervous. Did you expect otherwise? Not at all. You're under tremendous pressure, more than you've ever experienced. You think I'll crack? On the contrary. You should be proud of the way you're handling command. You've kept cool, taken charge, and made some very difficult decisions. Then what did you want? Battle bridge is ready. However, deflectors are not yet at full efficiency. Let's get them there, Mr. Solis. Aye, sir. I'll join you shortly. La Forge out. Did you hear the uneasiness in his voice? Solis is doing well. Yes, but he isn't handling the stress well. Both he and Ensign T'Su are young. They're good. But they lack battle experience. They're worried about making mistakes, and need encouragement. What do I do? Just remember it's you they draw strength from. They look to you for guidance and for leadership. Help them. Show confidence in them. Like Captain Picard showed confidence in me. Right. I understand. Thanks, Counselor. Prepare to initiate separation sequence. All decks report ready. On my mark. Now. Main latch bags to zero. Main latch retraction 1- 18, initiate. Static charge. Compensate. Separation complete. Lt Solis, lay in a reciprocal course for Minos warp five. Course set. On my mark. Engage. We seem to be well sealed in, Doctor. No exits? None that I can see. If you find one, go. Tired of my company already? Beverly. I'm tired... I need to sleep. Woke up too early. Talk to me. Stay awake. Tell me something. Tell me about... ...those roots. How did you know their medicinal value? My grandmother. Your grandmother was a doctor? No. She was a botanist, then? No. She helped to colonize Arvada III. Arvada III? That's such a tragedy. Did she survive? Yes. Once the medical supplies had run out, she had to use what was at hand. So she learned all about roots and herbs, and then taught it to me. You were part of that colony. I didn't know that. But there must be a lot of things about you I don't know. Quite a few. What? Now, just a minute, here's something odd. It's glowing. What is it? I don't know. It's... It's covered up. I'm just clearing away the dirt. It's a viewscreen. It seems to still be operative. It's a tracking device of some kind. Tracking what? There are three moving indicators. Possibly the away team. Beautiful, isn't it? It's the centerpiece of the whole unit. Who's that? A projection. It's the automated salesman who greeted us on the Enterprise. What unit? The Echo Papa 607. Our proudest achievement, the ultimate in weapons system technology. That's behind the attack on my people? Impressive demonstration, isn't it? Demonstration? It tried to kill us. Versatile, powerful, and easy to use. The 607 does it all. Its modules can gather information, neutralize ground personnel, even destroy enemy space vessels. The Enterprise. Is one of those things after my ship? Tell me. Of course. I am programmed to answer all questions about the unit. I can talk terms, arrange for delivery, whatever you need. It doesn't understand anything other than what it's peddling. The 607 represents the state of the art in dynamic, adaptive design. It learns from each encounter, and improves itself. What went wrong? Where are its creators, the people of Minos? Once unleashed the unit is invincible, the perfect killing system. Too perfect. You poor fools, your own creation destroyed you. What was that noise? The unit has analyzed its last attack and constructed a new, stronger, deadlier weapon. In a moment, it will launch that against the targets on the surface. Abort it! Why would I do that? It can't demonstrate its abilities unless we let it leave the nest. They are down there, sir. Let's clear that away. If Data's correct, the next one should show itself in two minutes. Captain, can you hear me? Yes, we're here! Are you alright? Dr Crusher is seriously hurt. We can't contact the Enterprise. The communicators are out. Yes, ours are out too. Those devices are part of a system located down here. Another is being released. Watch it. We know, Captain. There's nothing to hold on to. We can't climb down. I'm surprised they survived. I can go. How? Jump. Data, it's over ten meters. 11.75, sir. Data, you may be sturdy, but you're not indestructible. I can safely traverse the distance. Captain, Data's going to join you down there. Be my guest. Data. At your service, Captain. Let's find a defensive position. If Data's right... He usually is. ...we'll have company any minute, and this time, I don't know how we're going to stop it. Ship's log, supplemental. Lt La Forge in command of the star-drive section. After separating from the saucer, we have returned for the away team. Unfortunately, I have only one option left and it's a long shot. Shields and deflectors are up. Ensign, when I order the shields down you have one responsibility, locate the away team and grab them. You may only have a few seconds. Approaching the planet, sir. Things are gonna happen fast. Just keep alert, stay calm. Let's focus on what we're doing. You know your jobs. You've been trained, you've been tested. You've earned the right to sit in those chairs. That sound again. Another weapon. We must stop the system. I need the program schematic. You've got it. Is it possible to readjust the targeting sequence? Absolutely. It wouldn't be much good without it. Give it a new target. It must be specific. Itself or its own power source. That explosion would destroy this cavern and everyone above. Watch now. This is the fourth and final projectile. The Echo Papa Series 607 is about to complete this phase of its mission. We could split up. Why? Confuse it, delay it. It would still get us. One of us might get out of range. Out of range? Forget it. These devices wiped out the planet. It doesn't have a range. What does that leave us? Right. That's what I thought. We could look for deeper cover. You got any ideas? None. Give me some options, Data. Why don't you just shut it off? Is that possible? Why not? It's a machine, isn't it? Shut it off. Why? You haven't seen half of what it can do. We've seen enough. So you'll buy it? Yes, you've made a sale. You won't be sorry. Good. End the demonstration. Done. Number One. Right here. That was close. La Forge, everything's alright. We've neutralized it. Great to hear you, Captain. I'll get back to you. Phasers at readiness. Shields at full power. Heading 25, mark 300. We'll be heading deeper into the planet's atmosphere. Yup, and losing maneuverability, so hold on tight. Aye, sir. You hope our attacker will follow? I'm counting on it. Scan for any air disruption or vortex. It can't cloak its turbulence. How fast can you get a phaser lock? Fast. Hull temperature 1,000 degrees and rising. Power to deflectors. Steady as she goes. Hull temperature, 2,500 degrees. Deflectors nearing overload. Sir, helm going unresponsive. Can you compensate? Yes. Hull 3,000. Maintain heading. We're about to lose number four deflector. 3,300 degrees. Deflector four is now inoperative. Turbulence to starboard. There he is! Scanners locked. Weapons locked. Fire! Got him! Shields down. Locked on to away team. Beaming them home now. Come to 40 mark 65, ahead one third, and assume a standard orbit. Standard orbit. Aye, sir. Relinquishing command, Captain. As you were. Sir? When I left, this ship was in one piece. I would appreciate it being returned in the same condition. Do you concur, Number One? Absolutely, sir. Lt Solis, plot a course to rendezvous with the saucer section. Sickbay reports Dr Crusher's going to be fine. Course plotted, and laid in. Engage. "
S1E22,"All hands, this is the Captain. The sun in the Delos system is undergoing large-scale magnetic field changes, producing violent, gigantic flares. We shall study this star at close range. Even though we'll have full deflectors, the closeness of this event and its severity will create problems. Intense magnetic fields have a disruptive effect on electrical systems. We can expect communication interruptions and temporary loss of other systems. As a precaution, we're going to yellow alert. Stay sharp, everyone. Attention all decks. Yellow alert. Engineering, this is Lt Cmdr Data. Bring all systems on line and direct power to the shields. All sections secure. Lt La Forge? Course is set. Half impulse? Aye, sir, one half impulse. On main viewer. Mask out the photosphere. Magnify. Quadrant 07. Magnification, factor 12. I've never seen anything like this before. The violence of those eruptions is awesome. I'm reading an unusual number of sunspots and eruptive prominences. The magnetic field is extremely... irregular. Captain, deflectors are being hit by huge bursts of X-rays. Look. My console seems to be overloading. The X-ray burst is disrupting systems. I'm adjusting deflectors to compensate. Engineering, increase power to forward shields. Forward deflectors on line, sir. Status report. All systems operational, sir. Captain, the level of tension on the ship is mounting. Understandable. If we are to investigate, we must get closer. Move us in closer. Aye, sir. This is the Captain. We will be pushing the shields to the limit, but we are getting a splendid view of this phenomenon. Captain, I've intercepted what appears to be a distress signal. Let me hear it. This is T'Jon. I'm on the Ornaran freighter. We have a serious problem we can't fix. We need help. The transmission is coming from a freighter in orbit around the fourth planet in the system. However, the receiving station is on the third planet. Open hailing frequencies. Hailing frequencies open. Unidentified freighter, this is the USS Enterprise. May we be of assistance? Whoever you are, yes. I'm having trouble navigating. We can't maintain a steady course. Please help us. Can't you enhance the frequency? Too much interference. Set course to intercept with the freighter. Warp two. Maintain yellow alert. I can't control the helm any longer. I'm losing orbit. We're heading into the atmosphere. Please do something! We're going to burn up! We haven't much time... Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. It is a freighter, very old. Captain, our sensors are being affected by the sun flares. Take us as close as possible to the freighter's orbit. Moving in. There are six life forms aboard. The freighter's orbit is decaying. How long before it loses integrity? A matter of minutes. Unidentified freighter, this is the USS Enterprise. This is the Ornaran freighter Sanction. Put this on the main viewer. The visual transmission is still breaking up. Sanction, this is the Enterprise. What is your situation? Not so good. What is the problem? This is the Enterprise. With all this interference, it is difficult to copy your transmission. If you all talk at once, it is impossible. Now, please say again, what is your situation? I am T'Jon, Captain of the Sanction. At last. How can we help? We've lost... I don't know... something. I am not able maintain this orbit, nor can I use the main thrusters. It's all, you know, dead, I guess. It's all... shut down? Well, that is a little vague. What is the computer analysis? Our computer's not working very well. Data, can you tap into their computer and clarify this? I will attempt it, sir. Captain, the tractor beam is available if you want it. We could pull them out of orbit before they enter the atmosphere. Freighter, we're going to pull you out of orbit. Hey, that's great. Captain, the freighter's orbit continues to deteriorate. The solar flares are interfering with the tractor beam. We're unable to attach the tractor beam because of the solar activity. I understand. Thanks for trying. I have determined what is malfunctioning on the freighter. We have analyzed your problem. Great. Your ship uses an electromagnetic coil to constrict the exhaust flow. This coil is misaligned. Really? Do you have tools to realign it? I don't think so. We can provide them with a temporary substitute. Our ship's stores contain a coil. Can we beam one over? Yes. Captain, we're beaming over a replacement coil. That's great. And that'll fix us up? Yes, once it's installed. Right... And how do we do that? What is the matter with these people? How can he be Captain and not understand? Captain, how long have you been in command? Seven years. This is my 26th voyage to Brekka. You don't know how to align a control coil? It's never come up. Can anyone else over there do it? Hold on. I'll ask. Sorry. Nobody knows anything about it. I'd better go over with a team. I strongly recommend against anyone from this ship beaming over. The solar interference is too great. It has entered the atmosphere. Disintegration is imminent. We're running out of options. Let's get them off. T'Jon, stand by to beam over. If you think that's best... Unless you have any other options, yes, I think that's best. Whatever you say. I can't maintain a positive lock. Unusual EM burst, sir. Readings off scale. Sanction, we're having difficulty getting a fix. Have them go to their transporter room. Perhaps I can link two transporters and use the increased power. Worth a try. Go to your transporter room. Contact me from there. Right, Enterprise. It's right next door. But what makes you think our transporter will do the job? I'm going to interconnect them. I didn't know you could do that. Hurry! We're on our way. They won't make it. Capt T'Jon doesn't sound like he cares. How much time left? One minute, 28 seconds. Capt T'Jon? We're in the transporter room. Activate your transporter. Set coordinates 9703, mark 268. Did you say 286 or 886? Mark 268! Got it. Sir, the hull temperature of the freighter is passing 3,000 degrees. What's the hold-up? We're establishing the link right now. We're ready. All six of you, get on the transporter platform. On my signal, energize. I've got their signal. Interlock complete. Energize on my mark. Four, three, two, one. Energize! Did you get them off? They stayed in the freighter, but they beamed over their cargo. Cargo? Are those people crazy? What could be so important? Sir, the freighter is disintegrating. Their lives are in danger and they beam over cargo?! I don't understand. The freighter's hull temperature is approaching critical. Unbelievable. We've got to beam those people over now. Beam the cargo to a hold. Aye, sir. Sanction, get to your transporter... No, forget that. Lock on to any life form. Get them here. Trying, sir. The freighter is going down. You're out of time. Six life forms but no solid lock. We have no choice. Energize. Where are the other two? The lock didn't hold. Re-establish. It's too late. Number One? Two are lost, sir. But we saved four. I'm Cmdr William Riker of the USS Enterprise. I'm sorry we were unable to rescue the other two. We did everything we could. If you had come instead of sending your cargo, you'd have made it. The cargo! Where is it? You did save it? Yes. It's in one of our cargo holds. It seems more important to you than your comrades. The cargo... May we see it? Follow me. Thank you. We thought we had lost it. Careful with your choice of words, T'Jon. It's ours, not yours. We paid a fair price. You offered a price. We have not received it. You accepted our goods in trade! Then, where are they? Tell me. That's not our problem. The barrel is not your property. It's simple. The goods were never delivered. They were destroyed. Hence the deal was incomplete. Hence the felicium remains ours. We need it! Commander, I request you transport my associate and myself to Brekka with our merchandise. Yes. Get them out of here. But the barrel stays. There's no reasoning with you. Langor, you expect too much from them. You always have and you've always been disappointed. You didn't pay for it, therefore it's not yours! Damn you, Sobi! Stop this! Now! Security to cargo bay 11. Behave yourselves... gentlemen. Escort our visitors to the observation lounge. A natural electrical charge? Formidable. Yes, and a difficult weapon to confiscate. I have never seen humanoids with that power. I wonder how it evolved. The strong magnetic field of their sun? Could be. I wonder how much power they produce. Or if they need to recharge. How do I defend against them? They're a threat? I don't know. But I'd better be ready. Precisely, Lieutenant. We have to resolve this. There isn't much time. What can you offer? Everything we had was on the Sanction. Then it's going be difficult to accommodate you. Solar flares increasing. Shields are shaky but they're holding. Maintain. How are our quarrelsome guests? They're waiting for you, sir. Data, what information can you give us about the inhabitants? The only recorded contact with the Delos system was 200 years ago. A scout ship reported two inhabited planets, one on the verge of acquiring space travel. Odd, that in two centuries neither advanced much further. Sir, I find it strange that none of our visitors feels much remorse about the two passengers who perished. Yet that cargo is a source of great anxiety to them. Yes. Let's pay a call, get some answers. Number One, Mr. Data. La Forge, you have the bridge. Aye, sir. Captain, may I present Sobi and Langor from the planet Brekka? And T'Jon and Romas from Ornara. Sorry we couldn't save your ship. Tell me. You could have repaired it? Yes. We have only two left. Neither works properly. They are critical to our survival. Will you fix them? Mr. Data? Our computer has downloaded the specifications for the magnetic coils the freighters depend on. Assuming the malfunction is similar, replacements can be fabricated. Instruct Engineering to proceed. Aye, sir. Now, as for our cargo... Our cargo, Captain. Wrong, Sobi! My First Officer has said that ownership is in dispute, but this must be settled by whatever legal machinery exists between your societies. You don't understand. This is a matter of life and death. Why is that? What is this cargo? Medicine. Indeed? Our planet is in desperate need. People have a lethal plague. The cargo is the only hope of life for our people. Is that so? Yes. You must think us heartless, but look at our side of it. The plant which yields felicium grows only in remote areas of Brekka. It must be painstakingly cultivated, harvested, purified. A complex and expensive process. That single shipment represents an enormous investment. We can't just give it away. We paid for it. We ask for only what is ours. That is your viewpoint. Ours, of course, differs. You will hold to that position? I am constrained to abide by the terms of our agreement. You condemn us to death! Romas! You disgust me! lf you could see the suffering the plague has caused! Well... you are going to... ...when you see what it does to us. Romas, are you and T'Jon carrying this plague? Yes. Every Ornaran does. Then you may have brought it aboard. Was there a medical scan? Unverified. The solar flares could have caused a malfunction. Med alert. Dr Crusher to the observation lounge at once. You find us well, I trust? As far as I can tell. Your physiology is different than I've ever encountered, but I detect no dangerous virus or bacteria. I assure you, we're in perfect health. We are not. We need our medicine. Our medicine! We paid for it. It's ours now. Enough! Of course. You are right, Doctor. Could we leave now? I see no reason why not. Escort them to their quarters. Doctor... Captain, could I speak with you? In private. Not right now! Captain... What've you learned? The Brekkians appear uninfected. The Ornarans show all the symptoms, but I can't find a cause. Perhaps it was filtered out by the transporter. There's no record of it, but the flare activity might have caused a malfunction in the biofilters. Are they going to die? I need to check, but my instinct says no. Do you think we're in any danger? Again, I need more time. There are some missing pieces to this puzzle. What's missing is some compassion. Are we losing our professional detachment? Perhaps. But I'm developing a very active dislike for these Brekkians. Understandable. Captain, you must give us back our cargo. I can't do that. Why? It belongs to us. The Brekkians claim it's theirs. They lie. Maybe so, but it is not my decision. We need some now. I don't care if it's your decision. Get us some. This is happening to thousands more on Ornara. Please understand the size of the problem. You don't need it. The Brekkians don't need it! Our people do! If you don't give it to us, you will murder not only us but an entire civilization! I... I'm sorry. I do not mean to insult you. I'm feeling very shaky. We cannot hold out much longer. They believe it will help. That in itself might control their symptoms. I'll talk with the Brekkians. Thank you, Captain. We appreciate anything you can do. May I say how impressed we are with your ship and all its facilities? Thank you. And its crew. Everyone is so efficient and professional. I've come to seek your agreement to an Ornaran request. We cannot agree... Wait. Let the Captain speak. We want to be reasonable. The two Ornarans are ill, and insisting they need the felicium. That is not surprising. Would you give them enough for their own immediate needs? Captain, we Brekkians are in business. We are not in the habit of giving away that which hasn't been paid for. You'd see them die rather than share it? We want to be fair. We agree to permitting them two doses for immediate use. No charge. I'll let my Medical Officer handle it. You won't mind if we're present while you open the cargo? What does that device do? This measures the individual portions. What's the dosage? 0.01 milliliters. Very potent substance. We've improved our distillation process over the years. Years ago, the same amount of felicium would have filled five rooms this size. Now, with our improved processes, this barrel contains over four billion doses. I estimate four billion, 375 million... Thank you, Mr. Data. How long is the dosage effective? It varies. But never more than 72 hours. And then the symptoms return. Yes. There is no cure for the plague. But felicium inhibits the sickness with total efficiency. Allowing the Ornarans to lead normal lives. An unusual disease. Virulent, extremely persistent, yet I can't isolate it. The plague has baffled doctors on both planets for 200 years. We've therefore concentrated on treatment, finding new ways to improve the potency and purity of felicium. No doubt you applied technology from other industries to the refinement of this product. We have no other industry. None at all? We don't need any. The Ornarans provide us with everything we need in exchange for this. Fascinating. Your society is dedicated to the production of a single product. For which you have no use but which the Ornarans cannot live without. One of life's little ironies. But one we'd be fools not to take advantage of. It's... ...mutually beneficial. The Ornarans provide us with the necessities of life and we provide them with the necessities of living. It is a fair exchange. Interesting relationship. I'll take that to sickbay. Can I help? No. Hurry up! You're feeling better? Yes, thank you. I'm fine now. Come! I may not know felicium's effect on Ornaran physiology but I know how to interpret physical reaction. Are the Ornarans recovering? T'Jon and Romas are feeling fine. In fact, too fine. Felicium's a narcotic. Then T'Jon and Romas and everyone on their world... Is a drug addict. It's a fascinating tale we've come across. You've piqued my interest. Please continue. Data, what have we got? Several thousand years ago, the two planets took different paths. Ornara became technologically sophisticated, Brekka did not. 200 years ago, Ornara was stricken by a devastating plague. Their advanced technology could provide no solution. Somehow, and there is limited information on this point, a cure was found in a plant indigenous only to Brekka, which rejected all attempts at cultivation on Ornara. A trading situation developed which still exists. A nice deal for the Brekkians. And the Ornarans. Without the medicine, they'd die. No, they wouldn't. Despite what the Ornarans say, it is not a medicine. It was a medicine, but it cured the plague 200 years ago. The plague is irrelevant now. It doesn't exist. Why are they so desperate for felicium? It's an addiction. The physiological and psychological need is very real. Thank you. What are you going to do? There's nothing I can do. You don't think drug addiction and exploitation is sufficient cause to do something? This situation has existed for a long time. These two societies are intertwined in a symbiotic relationship. With one society profiting at the expense of the other. That's how you see it. I can synthesize a non-addictive substitute which will ease their withdrawal symptoms. No, I can't do that either. You can't let them have the felicium! Why? Because it offends against our sensibilities? It is not our mission to impose Federation or Earth values on others. In this case, Captain, I disagree, 100 percent! Captain, I'm receiving a call from Ornara. I think I can put it on the viewscreen. Do it. I'm Margan. Are my people on board your ship? Some of them, yes. May I speak to them? Yes. Lt Yar, have the Ornarans brought in. No, wait. I don't want them to have access to the bridge. We will contact you in a few minutes. I will continue this in the guest quarters. Commander, Doctor. Data, I can understand how this could happen to the Ornarans. What I can't understand is why anyone would voluntarily become dependent on a chemical. Addiction to drugs is a recurrent theme in many cultures. Wesley, no one wants to become dependent. That happens later. But it does happen, so why do people start? On my home planet, there was so much poverty and violence, for some, their escape was through drugs. How can a chemical substance provide an escape? It doesn't, but it makes you think it does. You have to understand, drugs can make you feel good. You feel on top of the world. You're sure of yourself, in control. But it's artificial. It doesn't feel artificial until the drug wears off. Then you pay the price. Before you know it, you're taking the drug, not to feel good, but to keep from feeling bad. And that's the trap? All you care about is getting your next dosage. Nothing else matters. I guess I just don't understand. I hope you never do. Lt Yar, we're ready in the guest quarters. T'Jon... do you have it? Yes, it is here, but... You've got to get it to us. T'Jon, please... We're dying down here. It's worse than it's ever been before. I'm doing everything I can. You see, what happened was... Stop! I can't listen any more. T'Jon, there are so many people here... So much suffering. We need the medicine. You've got to get it to us. I can't go on. Help, T'Jon. Please. I'm sorry. You will take us to our planet with our medicine or he dies! I have no choice! We were sent to bring felicium back. The suffering on my planet is too great. People are dying. It doesn't matter whether we're entitled to it. We must have it. Let him go. You will take us there now. Or give us a shuttle. But we must have the medicine. If you refuse, this person will die. I will not be coerced. I will do it. I will kill him. No, you won't. You're not a killer. Help us, please! I'm not sure that I can. My insides are still shaking, but I'm alright. Capt Picard, could I see you a moment? I'll stay here. Come with me, Doctor. This could be interesting. We have thought about this a great deal. We both feel deeply about what is happening on Ornara. And although it will cause hardship to us and to our people, we have decided to give the felicium to them. They can pay whenever they are able. We don't want to be responsible for their suffering. There goes the other shoe. They know. What do they know? That Ornarans no longer have the plague, that felicium is no longer a medicine. So, of course they are willing to give this shipment. They don't want the Ornarans to lose their addiction. They don't want to lose their only customers. How would they have known all that unless they once had the plague, too? They were infected. They used the felicium to cure themselves, but their ancestors realized that it was a narcotic. They broke the cycle of addiction and never told the Ornarans. They let them believe that without the felicium they would die. I think it's worse than that. I guess this refining process of which you are so proud... ...is only to increase the potency of the felicium and tighten your grip! What are you going to do? Will you tell them? No. I'm bound by the rules of the United Federation of Planets, which order me not to interfere with other worlds, other cultures. If I were to tell them, I'd violate the Prime Directive. But you are talking to us about it. This is information you already know. And so nothing has changed. If you can't interfere, you are going to allow the Ornarans to have the felicium? Yes, I am. No! Don't do it. Jean-Luc, this is not a symbiotic relationship. This is exploitation, pure and simple! The Brekkians have caused this suffering only to make their pitiful lives easier! And all of it based on a lie! No, deny them this shipment. It is the least we can do. From the moment they agreed to give the felicium, my hands were tied. You are absolutely right, Captain. It's not your business. Are these the spare parts for our freighters? They look complicated. Are they already...? Aligned? Right. You'd have to ask the Captain. Capt Picard, we've arrived at Ornara and assumed standard orbit. Acknowledged. Thank you. Captain, please, my planet is suffering. We beg you to give us our medicine. The matter is decided. You're beaming down to your world, with the felicium. Great! I knew it. I knew you'd help us. We thank you. Don't thank me. Sobi and Langor decided to let you have it. We'll discuss the payment terms later. There's no reason to deprive you of your needed medicine. That's terrific. I'm sure we can come to a fair deal for payment. May we beam down with you and discuss it? Of course. You are quite welcome on Ornara. We appreciate your hospitality. Captain, we appreciate your gift of the coils. Once our freighters are fixed, everything will be back to normal. No. No? The coils stay here. What about our freighters? You want to repair them, you'll have to do it yourselves. We can't. If you don't help us, our ships will soon be inoperable. Quite possibly. If you withhold the coils, you'll be disrupting the stability of both our planets. And interfering with an agreement that has lasted for generations. What of your Prime Directive? In this case, the Prime Directive prohibits me from helping. That's absurd! You did not think so when it favored you. Do you want our world to suffer? No, I don't want that. Without the freighters, there will be no more shipments of felicium. We will die. You must trust yourselves. There are... other options. Ensign, prepare to beam our guests and their cargo down to Ornara. Captain, I hope you realize what you've done to us. Of that you can be sure. Good luck. Main bridge. When the felicium runs out, the people of Ornara will suffer horrible withdrawal pains. No doubt, but they will pass. That seems so cruel. We could have made their burden easier. Could we have? Perhaps in the short term. But to what end? Hold. Beverly, the Prime Directive is not just a set of rules. It is a philosophy. And a very correct one. History has proved again and again that whenever mankind interferes with a less developed civilization, no matter how well intentioned that may be, the results are invariably disastrous. It's hard to be philosophical when faced with suffering. Believe me, there was only one decision. I just hope it was the right one. And we may never know. Resume. La Forge, take us out of orbit. Destination, sir? I don't care. Get some distance between us and this system. Aye, sir. Course 970, mark 318. Speed, warp three. Where will that take us? The Opraline system. An interesting choice. Why? Curiosity. We've never been there. Engage. "
S1E23,"Captain's log, stardate 41601.3. We are crossing through the Zed Lapis sector to rendezvous with shuttlecraft 13 carrying Deanna Troi who is returning from a conference. Because Engineering is working on our dilithium crystals, we are traveling on impulse power. Deep sensor probes show no obstacles or vessels within three light years. Confirm. The martial-arts competition is in three days. Are you prepared? I will be if you come to the holodeck later. I need help with the Mishiama wristlock and break. If it works on you, I can use it on anyone. A valid assumption. Who is your first competitor? Science Officer Swenson. You will defeat him easily. I'm more concerned with Lt Minnerly's kick boxing. You are favored in the ship's pool. You bet on me? A sure thing. Captain. Rendezvous with the shuttle in one hour and ten minutes. Thank you, Lieutenant. Aye, sir. It'll be good to have Counselor Troi back, won't it, Number One? It certainly will. Sir. I'm receiving an emergency transmission from the shuttle. On main viewer. I can't. We're receiving audio only. Open the frequency. What a jolt! Position report. Sir, on-board systems failure. Tell me where I am. Coordinates at 370.236. Confirm. I can't confirm. My instruments are haywire. Lt Prieto, is Counselor Troi alright? Yes, sir. Just a little shaken. We're being buffeted a bit. Losing more power! My flight-control computer's fried. Main Engineering. Lt Cmdr Leland T Lynch, here, sir. How long before we return to warp power? I'm realigning the dilithium crystals. There is an emergency. We need warp drive. How long? 20 minutes or more. We don't have it. I'll align it by hand. Whatever it takes. Shuttle, this is the Enterprise. Your coordinates now read 237.101. Ben, you're dangerously close to a planet. I can see it! The planet is Vagra II. Zed Lapis sector. Uninhabited. Lieutenant, report. This is Counselor Troi. I'll relay, sir. The pilot is busy. We've lost most of our impulse power. Engineering, status report. Working on it. Three minutes. But there are no guarantees. We're out of control. We're caught in planet's gravity. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, supplemental. We've lost contact with shuttlecraft 13. We can only assume they've crash-landed on Vagra II. Meanwhile, Engineering is trying to return us to warp power. Forget the final check. Initiate start-up sequence. Beginning checklist. Override. Go directly to start-up. That is not recommended. Understood. Now! Prime matter/antimatter injectors. Set ratio at 25 to one. Ratio set. Power engine core. Inject reactants. Leland T Lynch here. We now have minimum warp drive. Course set for Vagra II, sir. Warp eight. I said ""minimum"" warp drive. You heard the order. Make it so. Yes, sir. Approaching Vagra II. Strange, sir. There's no emergency signal from the shuttle yet. What is this place? There is little information on file, beyond the fact of its existence. Our sensors show no signs of life forms. Virtually no vegetation. Atmosphere? Minimum for our needs, sir. Standard orbit. Aye, sir. I've located the shuttle. Life signs? Not yet, sir. Still probing. It appears to be buried under a lot of debris. I may have something, sir. Faint life signs. Very faint. How many? We can't tell from here. Can we beam up the injured? No, sir. Our sensors cannot penetrate this debris. It's very unusual. Yes, sir. I cannot explain. Number One, prepare an away team. Data. Yar. Dr Crusher, have you been monitoring this? Yes. I'll meet the away team in transporter room four. Let's go. The life signs are weak. What is this? No idea. Go round, to be on the safe side. Let's try the other way. Enterprise, we've got a problem. What kind of problem? I'm not sure. A kind of slick is blocking our path. Will keep you apprised. Maintain an open frequency. Aye, sir. Analysis, Mr. Data. Inconclusive, sir. I cannot tell you what it is, but I can tell you what it is not. Explain. No evidence of neural or circulatory systems. No internal organs. Cellular structure unknown. No proteins known to us. It's narrow here. We can get over it. How is it moving? I do not know, sir. It does not have a skeletal framework or musculature. Then what's causing it to move? It appears to be following us, sir. No sign of intelligence, no brain, yet evidence of thought? Insufficient information, sir. Is it a life form, Data? Again, insufficient information, sir. Theorize. It is possible. Very good, Tin Man! What is it, Number One? What are you seeing? Trouble. Captain's log, supplemental. On a mission to rescue survivors from a shuttle crash, the away team has encountered a strange creature which is able to assume different forms, including one which resembles humanoid. Easy. Let's find out what we're dealing with. Agreed, Captain. Number One, I don't believe the location of the crash and the proximity of the creature is a coincidence. I am Cmdr William Riker of the USS Enterprise. I am Armus. Why are you here? We mean no harm. We have injured crewmen in the shuttlecraft. We need to get to them. May we pass? You haven't given me a good enough reason. Preserving life. All life is very important to us. Why? We believe everything has a right to exist. An interesting notion which I do not share! You may leave now, if you wish. We're not going without our crew. I warn you... Enough! Our people need attention. We won't hurt you, but we must help them. Number One! The creature attacked us. Lt Yar is down. It seems to feed on our phaser. We had no effect on it. What's Lt Yar's condition? Dr Crusher, report! She's dead. Transporter room, get them up. Now! I need her in sickbay now. Go to yellow alert, Lt Worf. I'll be in sickbay. Aye, sir. Status, Doctor? Unchanged. Can you bring her back? We'll see. Neural stimulator. Neural stimulator locked in. Interlock current feeds. Set sensitivity factor to 4.4. Affirmative. Monitoring 2.3, 1.8. You did it! No. She's on total support. There is no independent brain function. Current feeds operating. No response. Her synaptic network is breaking down. Inject norep. Neurons are beginning to depolarize. Direct reticular stimulation. Direct? Do it! Increase to 70 microvolts. 85 microvolts. Again. 90! She's gone. Gone? There was too much synaptic damage. That thing sucked the life right out of her. There's nothing I can do. Your friends have deserted you. They're not coming back. You're wrong. I killed one of them! Yes. I know. How could you be in there and know that? I felt her die. Do you want to know why I killed her? Your answer would be meaningless. That act had no reason. Exactly! It had no meaning. I did it because I wanted to. It amused me. No. You thought it would amuse you, but it didn't. You felt no satisfaction. No. It was too easy. You wanted her to suffer. You have a great need. I need nothing. Liar. End this. Let us go. Not yet. They won't give you what you want. And what is that? To break their spirit. Is that what I want? If breaking their spirit will amuse me, then that's what I will have. Never. She didn't do anything. Her phaser was lowered. She only wanted to get to Troi. She was killed in a senseless act. Lt Yar's death is very painful for all of us. We must try to deal with it for now. Until the shuttle crew is safely back aboard, our feelings will have to wait. Understood? Lt Worf, you are now Acting Chief of Security. I will do my best, sir. Doctor, how are the shuttle crew? We're receiving faint life signs, but the readings fluctuate. They may not be accurate. Armus is capable of creating undefined force fields. We cannot communicate or use the transporter, unless it allows it. A creature against whom we seem to have no defense. Number One? It's on that planet waiting for us. It killed Tasha, and it could've killed us, but it didn't. Deanna and Ben are alive for a reason. It knows that we won't leave while they're still alive. You're saying its attack on Yar was part of some tactic? To find out, we have to go back down. I may see something in the creature that's helpful. Agreed. Prepare an away team. I will remain on the ship. The object is not to engage it in battle. The goal is the safe return of Counselor Troi and Lt Prieto. I can best accomplish this at the tactical station. Very good. Number One? We're approaching the shuttlecraft. The creature is covering it. I lied to you. They came back. Let me talk with them. No! Why? Does the thought of my having contact with them make you uneasy? No. Not being able to contact you, not knowing if you are alive, makes them uneasy. Can't you feel how worried they are? Yes. They are worried. They care for you. You must be very special. We are members of a community. We all care for one another. Equally? You were really surprised they came back. Yes. Why? Because the others did not? What others? You can't hide the emptiness from me. The others. The ones who hurt you. Who left you alone, rejected. The ones who make you so angry. What do you know of them? Only what you tell me. I will tell you nothing. Not now. But soon. Captain, look at this. The energy field around the shuttle decreased for a few moments when the creature was draped over it. Low enough to beam them out? Almost. It's approaching the away team. The energy field over the craft is back to full intensity. Chart it. Look for a pattern. Aye, sir. She said you'd be back. Then she is alive? For now. Why have you returned? We've no choice. We must negotiate for our team. What do you want? Maybe I want nothing. Then you would have killed us all. I still might. What do you want? Tell me. Maybe we can reach an accommodation. If I tell you, will you give it to me? I might. It depends. I am a doctor. I need to treat our injured friends. Say ""please."" You asked nicely. I will allow it. Wait! I've changed my mind. Talk to her from here. How? Troi, can you hear me? Deanna, are you alright? I can hear you. Are you alright? Yes. We've encountered some difficulty. I know. She needs our help! So what? Our friends are suffering, meters away, yet you block our path. Why? You are all... ungrateful! What is he made of? It did not register on the tricorder. ""It""? Does that mean I am not alive? No. Clearly, you are some kind of intelligent form. But you said I did not register on your instrument. Perhaps your instruments are useless. Don't help him. Half-meter to the right. Aren't you going to lead him to his sight again, robot? No. You will just move it again. I will not help you hurt him. Then give it to him. I will find something else to amuse me. You said they wouldn't amuse me. You were right. And the emptiness remains. You sound so alone. I am alone. Abandoned. Who deserted you? Creatures whose beauty now dazzles all who see them. They would not exist without me. You were together? They perfected a means of bringing to the surface all that was evil and negative within. Erupting, spreading, connecting... In time, it formed a second skin, dank and vile. You. Yes. They discarded you and left. And here I am. You have my pity. Your pity? Save that for yourself! Something's got me! Touch him and he dies. No, don't! Armus has... enveloped Cmdr Riker. I'm beaming you up. If any of you leave now, he dies. And so do the survivors of the crash. Captain's log, supplemental. There is grave danger to the crew on Vagra II. My First Officer is missing, attacked by this entity known as Armus. Captain, take a look at this. The chart of the energy field around the shuttle. A lot of fluctuations. Yes, but there is a pattern. Here is where it killed Lt Yar. Here is where it absorbed Cmdr Riker. And here, here, where the energy is lowest? Both times it had enveloped the shuttle. It has something to do with Counselor Troi. Somehow, when it's dealing with her, the energy field is affected. I want to talk to her. I'll beam down. Lt Worf, you have the conn. Imzadi! No! Please, stop hurting him! He resists. If he would give himself over, the pain would diminish. He struggles. You should feel his strength. I can. Should I let him go? You only ask to torment me! Perhaps. How should I answer? What can I offer except myself? And would you give yourself for him? Would you give that much? Yes. Without hesitation. Just for him? No. Not just for him. I would do the same for any of the others. Armus, you have me. Let them go! Perhaps. Another has arrived. You are the one in charge? Is Cmdr Riker alive? Answer, Tin Man! I would guess that death is no longer sufficient to alleviate its boredom. Therefore, Cmdr Riker is alive. Maybe. Don't you want to ask me what I want? No. Not even to protect your own existence? I want to see my people in the shuttle. Entertain me. Then I will do it myself. You, Tin Man. Tell me, how would you feel if you were the instrument of death for your leader? Don't struggle. I do not control the phaser. Therefore, I would not be the instrument of his death. Perhaps killing the Doctor would engender more feeling. No. The control is still yours. And what about you, Doctor? Are you ready to die? Tell me you are not afraid. I am afraid. Beg me to spare you. No. One of you is going to die. And you, Doctor, get to choose. You don't like that, do you? Then I choose myself. No. You are going to live. One of them dies. Maybe this one. Though I would not call it death, since he is only a device. Tell me, Tin Man, how does it feel to face your own extinction? Curious. You are capable of great sadism and cruelty. Interesting. No redeeming qualities. So what do you think? I think you should be destroyed. A moral judgment from a machine. Armus, we're finished dealing with you. I have your man in here. And the others in the shuttle. No matter. We will no longer be a source of amusement. I can kill them. Yes. But only I can command them. They follow my orders. Have them amuse me. Only if I see my people on the shuttle first. Not possible! Then our business is concluded. And you claim you care about your comrades. I care. Which is why I must see them. You want to see your people? Then, here. Look... ...at this one! He's alive. Don't move. Is he alright? All signs show normal. So much frustration. It had to get rid of me. Now, let me see the others. No. My people will not entertain you until you do. They are incapable of entertaining me. I want you four out of here. Enterprise, beam up the away team. Aye, sir. They're no longer involved. This is between you and me. They may leave. Now... I want to leave this place. You want me to give you transportation? For which I will trade you lives. I must see my people in the shuttle. Will you give me what I want? I have the means. But first, I must see my people. If you must. Troi, are you alright? Yes. But Ben is not. He's alive. Were you able to help Tasha? No. Troi, we must talk. I believe we can outmaneuver this creature, and beam you and Ben up. We monitored the energy field around the shuttle. When the creature is here, the field weakens. Do you know why? The creature is filled with rage. Undirected, unfocused rage. When he confronts it, his guard goes down, because he's feeling it instead of suppressing it. Acknowledging his needs makes him vulnerable. What caused the rage? He was left here. Abandoned. The force field has to drop below 2.7 before we can beam them up. Satisfied? Yes. Then can we leave? To go where? Do you want to find those who left you here? She told you about them! How long have you been here? Since they left. A very long time. A long time to be alone. Save your compassion. It's revolting. You offer it like a prize when in fact it's an insult. Because you feel unworthy. You overrate your gift. You humans are puny, weak. But our spirit is indomitable. And still you die from a flake of my power. A great poet once said, ""All spirits are enslaved that serve things evil."" You do not understand. I do not serve things evil. I am evil! No. You are not. I am a skin of evil, left here by a race of Titans, who believed, if they rid themselves of me, they would free the bonds of destructiveness. Yes. So here you are. Feeding on your own loneliness. Consumed by your own pain. Believing your own lies. Set the computer. When the energy level reaches 2.6.205, beam up Troi and Prieto. We'll do a parallel transport on the Captain. You say you are true evil? Shall I tell you what true evil is? It is to submit to you. To surrender our freedom, our dignity, instead of defying you. I will kill you and those in there. But you will still be here. In this place. For ever. Alone. Immortal. Stand by for parallel transport. The energy level has dropped to 2.6.3. That's your real fear. Never to die! Never again to be united with those who left you. Energy field is 2.6. Computer beginning transport. I'm not taking you anywhere. Captain's log, stardate 41602.1. The shuttlecraft has been destroyed to prevent any possibility of Armus leaving the planet. Vagra II will be declared offlimits. But the damage has been done. One of the saddest duties I have ever had to perform is now ahead of me. We are here together to honor our friend and comrade, Lt Natasha Yar. Coming to terms with the loss of a colleague is perhaps the most difficult task we must face in the work we have chosen to pursue. We will all find time to grieve for her in the days ahead. But for now... ...she has asked that we celebrate her life... ...with this. Hello, my friends. You are here watching this image of me because I have died. It probably happened while I was on duty, and quickly, which is what I expected. Never forget I died doing exactly what I chose to do. I want you to know how much I loved my life, and those of you who shared it with me. You are my family. You all know where I came from and what my life was like before. But Starfleet took that frightened angry girl and tempered her. I have been blessed with your friendship and your love. You are the best. You trusted me, you encouraged me, and, most of all, you made me laugh. You are capable of so much love. You taught me without ever having to say a word. I realized I could be feminine without losing anything. We are so much alike, you and I. Both warriors. Orphans who found ourselves this family. I hope I met death with my eyes wide open. Your fierce devotion comes from within. It can't be diminished. From you, I have learned to strive for excellence... ...no matter what the personal cost. I'm sorry I won't be able to see you grow into the exceptional man you'll become. But your kindness and innocence are ageless. In those moments I felt the most despair, you took my hand and helped me to see things differently. You taught me to look beyond the moment. My friend, Data, you see things with the wonder of a child. And that makes you more human than any of us. I wish I could say you've been like a father to me. But I've never had one, so I don't know what it feels like. But if there was someone in this universe I could choose to be like, someone who I would want to make proud of me... ...it's you. You who have the heart of an explorer and the soul of a poet. So, you'll understand when I say... ...death is that state in which one exists only in the memory of others. Which is why it is not an end. No goodbyes. Just good memories. Hailing frequencies closed, sir. Au revoir, Natasha. The gathering is concluded. Sir... ...the purpose of this gathering... confuses me. How so? My thoughts are not for Tasha... ...but for myself. I keep thinking how empty it will be without her presence. Did I miss the point? No, you didn't. You got it. "
S1E24,"Captain's log, stardate 41697.9. We're en route to Sarona VIII for shore leave. The entire crew is looking forward to it. On a personal note, I have allowed myself the luxury of a head start. I took advantage. No, no, Lieutenant, the advantage was yours. Come again. En garde. Interesting move. But what technique was that? The technique of a desperate man. Interesting move. But what technique was that? The technique of a desperate man. Captain, what was that? Picard to bridge. Captain? Number One, did something unusual just occur on the bridge? Yes, we experienced some kind of loop where everything repeats itself. Here, too. I'm on my way. Report, Mr. Data. Sensors show nothing, sir. But it appears a moment in time repeated itself exactly for everyone. Just like déjŕ vu. Reports coming in from all decks. Computers were also affected. The phenomenon was not an illusion, but occurred in real time. Number One, find out if anything similar happened in this sector. I am receiving an emergency transmission from the Pegos Minor system. Put it on. ...542.2. I repeat. This is Dr Paul Manheim. We are in need of help. Urgent. All ships, please respond. I repeat. Coordinates are 66728.9 by 7075... It is an automated signal. I cannot establish contact. This is Dr Paul Manheim... Shut it off. Lay in a course on those coordinates. You act as if there's a connection between the time distortion and the signal. There is. Paul Manheim. 15 years ago, he went off to work on experiments relating to non-linear time. It appears he has achieved some success. Speed warp eight. Aye, sir. Engage. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Estimated arrival, Pegos Minor, four hours, 35 minutes, 17 seconds. I've never heard of Paul Manheim. Mr. Data? A highly respected scientist, considered a visionary, he had time-related theories. One regarding time and gravity was intriguing. But none of his theories received wide acceptance. 15 years ago, he assembled a team of scientists to expand that research. They disappeared. Haven't been heard from since. Did you know him? I knew of him. He was teaching at the university when I was in Paris, but I... ...didn't have the pleasure. I must change. Number One, inform me half an hour before we reach those coordinates. Try to determine if the time distortion was specifically located on the Enterprise. Captain? Excuse me. Yes, what is it, Counselor? I think you would prefer to discuss this in private. That's not necessary. Go on. When Prof Manheim was mentioned, you reacted with intense emotion. Yes. Please get to the point. I don't want to interfere with your personal life, but unresolved strong emotion can affect judgment. Well, thank you for your concern. As ship's Counselor, I offer my assistance. What do you suggest? Confronting deep personal issues is not easy for you. You tend to suppress them. There are a few hours until we arrive. Perhaps you should use this time to analyze your feelings and put them into perspective. Thank you. If I should need you further, I'll let you know. Bridge. Belay that. Computer, estimated arrival at Pegos Minor. Two hours, nine minutes. Holodeck three. Computer, this is Capt Picard. Holodeck three is clear. Location, Paris, Café des Artistes, as it appeared... 22 years ago. April 9th, 15:00 hours, three o'clock. Warm spring day. Program complete. Monsieur, welcome to the Café des Artistes. Is this your first time in Paris? No. This way. That table. Mais, bien sur, monsieur. We are here to please you. I've been away far too long. Some wine, some cheese? I'm not very hungry. I... really came for the view. Perhaps what you hunger for is not on the menu. Perhaps not. It was many years ago. I... had a rendezvous. I was to meet someone. Someone... here, at that very table. Your young lady, she did not come? Actually, I don't know. I always imagined that she did. You, however, did not. Well... trust Edouard. I will bring something very special, just for you. Let's go. We've waited long enough. Fine. You go. I'll stay a little longer. He's not coming, Gabrielle. No, after last night, I know he will. Then he would be here. You are making a fool of yourself, and I will not watch. Do we know each other? No. Do I remind you of someone? No. Yes. You do, somewhat. He's not coming. Why? What did I do to drive him away? Maybe you did nothing. Maybe he had no choice. Maybe he was afraid. Of what? Of me? Of being... connected. Rooted. Perhaps if he's as young as you are, he doesn't know what he wants to do. Maybe... Enough of this self-indulgence. Exit! We received communication from the Lalo, and from a farming colony on Coltar IV. Both described the time distortion. The captain of the Lalo called it a hiccup. Hiccup? That may be an incorrect analogy. How so? A hiccup is an inhalation with closure of the glottis, accompanied by a peculiar sound. If we use the analogy of a body function, what occurred... Enough, Data. Have you learned any more about the Manheim project? Only what you already know. Manheim was concentrating on time-gravity. Captain, we've reached the coordinates specified. There's nothing here. I'm receiving new coordinates. It's a relay signal. Same source as before. What are they? 664.8 by 1,323.7 by 4,949.9. Very remote area, sir, in the Vandor system, a binary-star system. Main star's a B-Class giant, the companion star's a pulsar. Set course for the new coordinates. Why is he making it this difficult to find him? Hopefully, he'll tell us, Number One. We have reached the coordinates. Sensors indicate it is Vandor IV, a planetoid in elliptical orbit around a binary system. Standard orbit, Mr. La Forge. Aye, sir. Give me a visual. Viewscreen on. There's a small force field on the planet. Latitude, 20 degrees, nine minutes north. Longitude, 40 degrees, two minutes east of the present terminator. Penetrable? No, sir. Open hailing frequencies. Frequencies open, sir. This is Captain... This is the Captain of the USS Enterprise responding to your call for help. Thank you for hearing us. Where are you? We're in orbit around Vandor now. You can help me. I don't know what to do. It's only the two of us left. He's having convulsions. Please. Can you lock on to her coordinates? No, the force field is preventing any contact other than audio. There is a force field. I know. Good. But it is preventing us from helping you. You must find some way to shut it down. I'll try. Force field is off. Good. Lock on to their coordinates. Beam them to sickbay. Dr Crusher, prepare for a medical emergency. Two to beam up. We'll be ready. That's where I'll be. I'll help. Easy. I've got his legs. How long has he been like this? Several hours at least. He was in his lab, so I'm not sure. I need to do some tests. I thought the voice sounded familiar. Hello. I should have known. Who else would have charged to my rescue? This is my First Officer, Cmdr William Riker. Lt Cmdr Data. This is Jenice... Manheim. A pleasure, Mrs. Manheim. Thank you. I have a number of questions for you. I hope I can be of some help. Why don't we sit down here? What happened to the rest of the crew? They were working at the second lab. Something happened there a few weeks ago. They were all killed. It was a terrible accident. I don't know what happened. So many brilliant, wonderful minds... just gone. Do you know the nature of Dr Manheim's work? Paul's interested in time. He's never believed that it was immutable, any more than space is. He came to believe that we reside in one of infinite dimensions, and what holds us here is the constancy of time. Change that, and it would open the window to those other dimensions. Which begins to explain what happened. Have you experienced something up here? Yes, what is emanating here is having repercussions light years away, maybe even further. That would explain his anxiety. I had no idea it had gone so far beyond Vandor. Why this place? Why Vandor? Paul and the team searched for two years to find it. Vandor's exactly what they needed. A planetoid around a binary star. Because of the pulsar's gravity. Did your husband ever attempt to define these dimensions to show you what he expected? No. But he did say that he was very close to proving his theories. And then the accident. Did he anticipate that these experiments might be dangerous? I didn't think so. But now, in retrospect, he probably did. That would explain the unusual precautions he began taking, even before the accident. The force field, the elaborate security system. When he started a new experiment, he insisted I stay in what he called a protected room. That's why you weren't affected. He would never knowingly do anything to hurt anyone. Yes, I believe that. But as he saw his goal getting closer, seeming possible, he became more obsessive. Maybe that clouded his judgment. This is not how I imagined seeing you again. Nor I you. You've done well. A great starship on the far reaches of the galaxy. It's everything you'd hoped. Not exactly. Nothing works... just as you hope. If you can't tell us any more, I need to send a team to the lab. You can't. It's protected. One of the scientists made sure no one could get in. Excuse me. Is he worse? He's resting, but you should undergo some tests. My nurse will start them. Thank you for your kindness. She's an old friend. I gathered that. It's her husband I'm more concerned with. What's the prognosis? I believe he's dying. His neurochemistry's been affected, but I don't know how or why. How long does he have? Maybe a couple of days. I can only maintain him until I find out what's causing the damage. Can we talk to him? Not now. Not yet. Incidentally, the effects of the time distortions are now being felt in the Ilecom system. Bridge. Manheim has turned vague theories into a practical application. But without his help, I doubt we can pose any intelligent questions, let alone come up with any solutions. Incidentally, the effects of the time distortions are now being felt in the Ilecom system. It's us before we stepped into the turbolift. It's happening again. I feel no disorientation. Nor do I. What was that? I believe the Manheim Effect is becoming more pronounced. This is where we started... if we are us. We are us, but they are also us. Indeed, we are both us, at different points along the same time continuum. Bridge. What have you learned? We've scanned the planet, sir. The second lab is completely destroyed. Unable to determine what caused it. Little to clarify the situation. Sensors show an immense volume of energy within the planet near Manheim's remaining laboratory. How's the energy used? No idea. Its source? I cannot be sure. But I believe Manheim can harness energy from the pulsar. We've learned everything we can from here, and we are no closer to understanding it. Manheim is unable to help us, but hopefully he kept notes. I need to study the records. We'll have to go down there. What about the defense system? When the shield was lowered, it may have been turned off. If not, we'll deal with it. Prepare your team. Aye, sir. Coordinates set? Yes, sir. Energize. There's a lack of integrity. I'm losing them. Bring them back. Now! What's going on? There seems to be some kind of strange bouncing effect. I can't get them to materialize. My readings aren't complete. Keep trying. Why are we back here? You're lucky you made it back at all. Where am I? Thank God. You're on the USS Enterprise. They answered your distress signal. I sent one? Paul, you're going to be fine. No. I am not fine. I'm not even close to fine. Bridge, Prof Manheim is conscious. It was worth it, what happened. What will happen, all of it. It was all worth it. Again. It's changing again. What is? What do you see? I'm having difficulty. With what? Are you in pain? I have been on the other side. I have touched another dimension. Part of me is still there. Help him. Try to stay calm. It won't help you, struggling against it. My mind is floating between two places. It is difficult to know which is which. There is no way to explain it. I'm Capt Picard. The same one? She has told me about you. Not all. But enough. We need your help. The situation is not good. It will get worse. How do we stop it? I'm having difficulty holding the moment. Doctor, this is Lt Cmdr Data. Will you explain the situation to him? I am fully versed on your theories on time and gravity. How is that possible? I am not fully versed on all my theories. I am an android. Android? On a Starfleet vessel? I am the only one. Your knowledge is useless. Our work has made most of those theories obsolete. Then you have harnessed a dynamic energy source. Then you do understand. Yes. We located an energy source in the centre of this planetoid. We learned to enhance it, to focus it. Everything worked too well. The energy from the pulsar, the energy from the planetoid... We opened a crack... a window into another dimension. The time distortion we felt. Felt? Then... it is not confined to the planetoid? The range is at least several thousand light years. It must be stopped. You must help me to execute a controlled shutdown of my experiment. Get my notes. They're in the lab. How do we bypass the security system? I'll give you the coordinates to beam safely down to Vandor, and the codes you need to bypass security systems to get into my lab. If what the Professor has given me is accurate, we can repair the damage. But it must be timed to coincide with another time distortion. Can we predict it? I believe so. We have to. This other dimension will rip into the fabric of the galaxy. Reality will not be the same. Lt Worf, I want those codes that Manheim gave Mr. Data rechecked and checked again. No one beams down unless we're sure they can get through. Aye, sir. I'm sorry for intruding. I was told I'd find you here. You're not intruding. We're just finished. Come in. I knew you wouldn't come to me. No. Not under these circumstances. We have unfinished business. Yes, we do. Why didn't you come to meet me that last day in Paris? I was afraid. I didn't want this. What? The truth. You want me to lie? Of course. A nice, soft, painless lie. I got the days confused. I thought it was Tuesday, not Wednesday. I went to the Café Moulin instead. That's better. It was raining. You couldn't find a cab. I waited all day. And it was raining. It rained the rest of the week. I went to Starfleet headquarters, but you'd already shipped out. So... come on. Let's hear the truth. It was fear. Fear of seeing you, losing my resolve. Fear of staying... losing myself. Fear that neither of these choices was right and that... And that either would have... For a long time, not a day went by that I didn't look up into the sky... and wonder. Each time that I returned to Earth, my thoughts were filled with you. I've thought a lot about this over the years. Perhaps you're leaving out your greatest fear. The real reason you left. Which was? That... life with me would have somehow made you ordinary. You're wonderful. And am I that transparent? Only to me. I wish I could talk to you. I bet you were really something. I wanted to see how he was doing. The same. Nothing I do seems to make any difference. That's not why you're here. I thought I was the empath. Are you alright? Why wouldn't I be? I have one of the medical wonders of the galaxy dying in my sickbay. That's not what I meant. I don't want to talk about what I think you mean. I can't compete with a ghost from his past. No one could. She's not a ghost. She's here right now. She may be in the here and now, but it's the ghost he sees. Excuse me, I have to get back to my patient. How soon, Mr. Data? If Dr Manheim's information is correct, by my calculations, the next time distortion should occur between 28 to 47 minutes. Bridge, this is sickbay. Dr Manheim is awake, and asking to speak to you, Captain. Alone. On my way, Doctor. You asked for me. I am not sure I remembered all the codes for the security system. You should warn anyone going down there. Thank you. I'll tell them to be cautious. What I really wanted to talk to you about is Jenice. I did not come to discuss your wife. It is only this... If anything should go wrong, please... take care of her for me. Of course. She never would admit this, but she has had a terrible time these last years. Had we not been so isolated, she might have left me. I never would have known, at least not right away. Perhaps I'm not a man who should have a woman like her. She deserves better. You underestimate her. I know, because I once did. In both cases, the time distortions occurred along the same continuum as a preview or reprise of a specific point in time. Where we are, were, and where we will be. Data, I want this to be an away team of one. You. There's no reason to risk anyone else. It is reasonable, sir. After all, I am a machine and dispensable. ""Indispensable"" is the appropriate word. But you seem more able to control the effects of the time distortion. I see. That is quite true, sir. I see time as a constant, whereas humans perceive time as flexible, hence the expression ""Time flies when you're having fun,"" which until now has always confused me. Well, I want you to put a stitch in time and save much more than nine. Sir? If other members of the away team became disoriented, it could create additional problems, and perhaps increase the danger. I will go immediately, sir. Good luck, Data. Alright, we have the coordinates exactly as the Professor specified. I am proceeding to the lab, sir. Maintain an open frequency. Aye, sir. Mr. Data, what's going on? Dr Manheim forgot to mention one of his security precautions, sir. I am proceeding into the laboratory. This channel will remain open. Please continue to report. This appears to be the instrument Dr Manheim described. It should confirm when the next time effect will occur. Do you have enough information to decipher the security code? I will know in a moment, sir. According to calculations, the next time effect will occur in one minute, 30 seconds. What's the next step? I need to add antimatter to rebalance and align the system. Will that plug the hole? Theoretically, yes. In reality, I do not know. When the effect hits, the force fields will align, opening a clean, straight path to the other dimension. Whatever the time distortion, I must add the antimatter at the appropriate moment. Geordi, if the Professor was right, I need a 27-second countdown. You got it. Captain, I now have the antimatter, and am moving towards the opening at the end of the lab. The next time distortion should occur within seconds. Geordi, begin countdown on my mark. Now. 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20... Captain, there appear to be three of us. Should I drop the antimatter or wait for one of you? Only one of us is at the correct time continuum. Which one? Me! It's me. Five, four, three, two, one. Now. Data? Report. Are you alright? Yes, sir. Is it closed? It is well patched, sir. ""Closed"" means permanent, which I cannot guarantee. Patched is good enough. Well done. Beam back immediately. With pleasure, sir. This is amazing. All your readings are completely normal. Where is my wife? She's right here. The effect has been reversed. I can feel it. We're safe. How is he? He needs rest. There may be residual effects. Other than that, he'll be alright. I feel like I'm coming out of a long tunnel. It's there. Not at all like I thought it would be. Different. Describe it. I can't. Not yet. The only words that fit are too pale because the images are so vibrant. It's not like anything anyone has experienced before. There was... No. No, there is this kind of life. Not like us. Not like this. What's the condition of my lab? Intact for the most part. Don't tell me we're going back? Jenice, we are so close. We have learned so much to walk away. Besides, we owe it to the others, our friends. There have been so many sacrifices by so many good people. We'll be going back. Yes, I can see that. The Federation will want to help in any way it can. Thank you. This time it will be different, I promise. It always is, my love. You said my life would never be dull... and it never has been. Thank you. Computer, this is Troi. Request access. Terminate the current program? No, continue the program. Enter when ready. The Captain is waiting for you inside. How's this possible? It's Paris. Unbelievable. Madame, this way. The Captain is waiting for you. This is so real. Bien sur. Pourquoi pas? Don't tell me how you did it. I don't care. It's perfect. It's as if we were really there. I wanted to say goodbye properly this time. I shall always picture you here. I expect you to always come charging to my rescue. I'll do my best. Goodbye, Jean-Luc. Be well. And you. Thank you for Paris. Well, so much for my dramatically romantic exit. Is anything wrong? No, sir. Set course for Sarona VIII. As I remember, we were on our way for much-needed shore leave. Course plotted and laid in, sir. Warp five. Engage. I've been there once. There's this club. I don't remember the name. They serve blue concoctions. It's across the square from the dance palace. It's called the Blue Parrot Café, and you're buying. "
S1E25,"First Officer's log, stardate 41775.5. We are en route to the ocean world of Pacifica. While our mission is scientific, we look forward to the blue waters and fine beaches that make Pacifica a jewel of the galaxy. So the guy staggers to his feet and goes back to the girl. She smiles, looks him straight in the eye and says, ""Just try that in hyperspace!"" I see. So the difficulty in attaining such complex positioning in zero gravity and the effect it would have on a human male's psychological wellbeing, is what makes this anecdote so amusing. Yes, very humorous indeed. Hysterical, in fact. What is our ETA at Pacifica, Mr. La Forge? 22 hours, 14 minutes, sir. Increase to warp six. Aye, sir. Full impulse. Would anyone object to our arriving ahead of schedule? I know I won't. I've been really looking forward to a nice swim. The holodeck can be programmed to recreate an oceanic environment. Data, it's just not the same. Have you ever been for a real moonlight swim? One can swim in moonlight? How about you, Mr. Worf? Swimming is too much like... bathing. Cmdr Riker. I'm receiving a Code 47. Verify. It is Code 47, sir. Starfleet emergency frequency. Code 47. Captain's eyes only. Captain, I'm sorry to disturb you. Yes, what is it? An incoming message. Code 47, sir. Pipe it through. This is an emergency communiqué. It is not to be discussed with fellow officers unless deemed absolutely necessary. There will be no computer record of said transmission. Understood. Proceed with voiceprint identification. Picard, Jean-Luc. Captain, USS Enterprise. Voiceprint verified. Walker! Hello. It's been a long time. Too long, old friend. Why are you contacting me on this frequency? It was a difficult decision. I felt it was worth the risk. Risk? It's about Starfleet. About something we've always considered impossible. I don't understand. I can't explain it now. We need to talk face to face. You're using a Code 47. I have to know what all this is about. Not over subspace, no. For God's sake, this is a secured channel. No! I want you to meet me on Dytallix B. When? Immediately. We're expected at Pacifica. That can wait. You owe me. And you owe it to yourself to hear what I have to say. Something is beginning. Don't trust anyone. Remember that, Jean-Luc. Don't take anything for granted. Walker. Dytallix B. We'll be waiting. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Data, are you familiar with Dytallix B? It is an uninhabited planet, mined for the Federation by the Dytallix Mining Company. It is in the nearby Mira system. Mr. La Forge, chart a course for it. Warp seven. There will be no records or logs mentioning this diversion. Captain, they're expecting us at Pacifica. Shouldn't we let them know? Negative. Nothing goes out without specific orders from me. Hopefully, the delay... will be minimal. I have the read-out on Dytallix B. What have you got? Dytallix B is the fifth of six planets circling the red giant, Mira. One side always faces the sun. Temperatures reach 180 degrees. The mines line the temperate zone between the day and night sides, but they are deserted. Why the devil are we going to this planet? Are there any miners or indigenous life forms there? The answer to both questions is no, sir. It is nothing but a lifeless hunk of rock, a useless ball of mud, a worthless chunk... Thank you, Data, I get the idea. Captain, we are approaching Dytallix B. Very good, Number One. I'm on my way. Captain, sensors are detecting three Federation starships already in orbit around the planet. Identify. Two are frigates. The Renegade, commanded by Tryla Scott, and the Thomas Paine, Capt Rixx commanding. The third is coming into range now, sir. It is Ambassador-class heavy cruiser USS Horatio. Horatio? Isn't that Walker Keel's ship? Attempts at communication have been ignored by all three. Make no further attempts, Mr. Worf. Any life-form readings on the surface? Three, sir. All gathered inside what appears to be the entrance to a mining tunnel. Very well. Relay those coordinates to the transporter room. I'm beaming down. Alone, Captain? Alone, Number One. Thanks for coming. This is some greeting, old friend. Tell me, Jean-Luc... where did we first meet? Answer the question. Tau Ceti III. It was a bar. Quite an exotic one as I remember. What do I win? Do you recall the night you introduced Jack Crusher to Beverly? You know that I hadn't met Beverly then. You introduced them. My brother introduced them. You don't have one. Two sisters, Ann and Melissa. What the hell is this about? Apologies, Captain. We had to be sure you were really you. Walker, what is going on? Capt Picard, meet Capt Rixx. I believe we've met. The Altarian Conference. And Capt Scott. Tryla Scott. You made Captain faster than anyone in Starfleet history, present company included. Are you that good? Yes, I am. Starfleet's finest. Fancy meeting you here. We all came secretly, Picard, to discuss the threat. What threat? Have you noticed anything unusual about Starfleet Command lately? No. But we've been on the outer rim for a while. We haven't had much contact with them. Some of us have seen... strange patterns emerging. Unusual orders, officials backing irrational proposals. Starbase 12 was completely evacuated for two full days. No explanation given. And what about the deaths? McKinney, Ryan Sipe, Onna Karapleedeez. All dead? A series of accidents. Or so they say. It's hard to be certain of anything. Interfleet communications are at a minimum. But something is happening. We expect the Enterprise to be targeted soon. Targeted for what? By whom? We're not sure yet. Jean-Luc, some of Starfleet's top Command people are changing. This could affect the core of our organization. Officers I've known for years bluff their way through talk of old times. That's their weakness, a lack of memory. He doesn't believe us. He thinks we're crazy. You give me nothing to believe in. Just vague talk about strange patterns, irrational proposals. Who's behind this, and to what purpose? How are people being changed? I can't say, exactly, but I think it's spread to my own ship. My First Officer hasn't been the same since we stopped off at Earth. Our Medical Officer says he's normal, but I don't trust him. We know we don't have all the answers. All we ask is that you keep your eyes open. That's sound advice at any time. Stay in touch with us... covertly. This meeting never took place as far as Starfleet is concerned. Please... I'm asking this as a personal favor. I'm glad, Jean-Luc. I'm glad you're still one of us. Tell Beverly I... said hello. And watch your back, Picard. Close friends are few and far between. Two of the oldest and closest are Jack Crusher, may he rest in peace, and Walker Keel. Before various missions split us up, we were virtually inseparable. I trust Keel. If he had to violate regulations, he must have had a good reason. But you're putting your career at risk for him. Friendship must dare to risk, Counselor, or it's not friendship. They illicitly used the emergency channel. Then they asked you to keep secrets from your superiors, effectively to disobey Starfleet regulations. The people involved are of the highest caliber. I believe in their loyalty. Shouldn't you tell the crew? No. I don't want to risk implicating them. Not until I have solid evidence that something really is wrong. Take us out of orbit, Mr. La Forge. Aye, sir. Head for Pacifica, warp eight. Aye, sir. We should arrive 9.63 hours behind the original schedule, sir. Good. I have an assignment specifically suited to your talents. Computer, this is Lt Cmdr Data. Please access all Starfleet Command orders to starships, starbases and colonies for the last six months. Working. Doctor. The Horatio was seen in orbit around Dytallix. Did you see Walker? No. I would have loved to have seen him. It wasn't possible. Captain. I'm picking up an unusual disturbance in a nearby quadrant. Confirmed, sir. Sector 63. Specify. What kind of disturbance? Hard to say at this distance, sir. I guess the trip to Pacifica will have to wait. Let's investigate. Maintain speed. Alter course. Aye, sir. Changing course to 351, mark four. Approaching Sector 63, sir. Slow to impulse. Aye, sir. Going to impulse power... now. Sensors picking up small objects, sir. On screen. It doesn't look natural. Agreed. Enlarge and identify. It looks like... debris. From a space vessel of some kind. It could be a ship that was orbiting Dytallix. We are close to that planet. Identifying marks, Mr. Worf? Nothing so far. Sensors not detecting any bodies in the flotsam. But from the amount of wreckage... I'm sorry, sir. It can only be the Horatio. From the looks of it, she's been totally destroyed. Captain's personal log, stardate 41776.1. The apparent death of Walker Keel has had a powerful impact on me. I now believe there may be a cancer growing within the Starfleet ranks. I've alerted my Executive Officer to the suspicions voiced by Keel. There's no proof. Admiral Quinn tried to warn me about a subversion within the Federation. Then Walker tried. He's dead. Subversion? Personally, I don't believe this conspiracy theory. Startling! Quite extraordinary, in fact. Direction unclear. Please repeat request. That was not a request. I was simply... ...talking to myself. A human idiosyncrasy, triggered by a fascination with a set of facts. Or sometimes brought about by senility. Or used to weigh information before reaching a conclusion. Or... Thank you, sir, I comprehend. Please specify how you would like to proceed, sir. Please continue with record scan. Intriguing. We have no facts. We have to assume that the explosion was an accident. I believe what happened on the Horatio was sabotage. But we can't be certain. Perhaps we can. I searched for abnormal patterns in Starfleet's directives. I believe I have found just that. These are outposts and starbases where I've detected unusual activity for a few months. What sort of activity? An uncustomary reshuffling of personnel, usually in Command areas. The new officers have frequent contact with the highest levels of Starfleet. Why hasn't anyone discovered this before? The orders were given with great subtlety. Starfleet's left hand did not know what its right hand was doing. Can you speculate as to the purpose of these reassignments? I believe it is a clandestine attempt to control vital sectors of Federation territory. This could be a prelude to an invasion. But who's behind it? There's insufficient data to make an assessment. Do you suggest we warp over to HQ and demand to know what's going on? Why not? Yes, why not? We're talking about a threat to the future of the Federation. I don't think any of us can rest easy until we've been to the source. Captain's personal log, supplemental. While it is unusual for a starship to return to Earth, we seem to have no other choice. I have apprised the remaining bridge crew of our situation. Approaching Earth. Standard orbit, Mr. La Forge. Standard orbit, sir. Any word from Starfleet Command? Nothing so far, sir. Strange. Captain, I am now receiving a message from Starfleet Command. On screen. Greetings, Enterprise. I am Admiral Savar. This is Admiral Aaron. And I believe you already know Admiral Quinn. Yes. Good to see you again, Admiral. And you, Captain. We are always delighted when the Enterprise returns to the nest. Yet we are puzzled by the timing of your visit. Yes, sir, I can imagine that you would be. Governor Delaplane of Pacifica says you cancelled your stop there. Is this true? Yes, sir, it is. Explain yourself. Why have you returned to Earth? I would rather discuss that in person. Excuse us for one moment. They seem normal enough. On the surface. Counselor, any thoughts? Hard to say. Someone is hiding something. But I can't tell who or what. I'm not overjoyed to see Remmick again. Their response has been pretty temperate. I don't like it. You can't trust them. Forgive the delay, Capt Picard. We'd be delighted if you and your First Officer would join us for dinner. Delighted. It would give you an opportunity to expatiate your own viewpoint. To elaborate upon what is troubling you. Thank you. We accept your gracious offer. Excellent. Preparations are already under way. We'll greet you in the reception area in, say, 20 minutes? Splendid. I won't be able to attend dinner, I'm afraid. But I'd like to see the ship and say hello again. Of course. We look forward to seeing you. Enterprise out. Quinn wants to see us alone. At least we know he's still on our side. Mr. Data, you have the bridge. Aye, sir. Are you ready to beam up to the Enterprise, sir? Yes, Commander, quite ready. Energize, Mr. Remmick. Welcome aboard, Greg. Good to see you. You remember Cmdr Riker. Hello again. You're looking remarkably well. Never felt better in my life. When you were here last, you were saying you felt tired. Tired of life I was, but not any more. I'm ready for new challenges now. What about another look at this ship? Remember what you told me at Relva VII, about the threat that you perceived to the Federation? Is that why you're here? One of the reasons, yes. But, Jean-Luc, you took me far too literally. I was only referring to the problems in assimilating new races into the Federation. It's an ongoing, tumultuous process, which can cause stress and strain on every aspect of our alliance. I'm sorry, I must have misunderstood. Don't apologize. If I misled you, I humbly ask your forgiveness. Of course. Now, you have a dinner to attend. I would like to freshen up before I look around. We've arranged your usual rooms. That's outstanding. I should be getting down to the planet. Riker will be available here to show you anything you want to see. It's really not necessary. I insist. When you've finished showing the Admiral around, you can join me down on Earth. I may want to stay awhile. Of course. Stay as long as you wish. No. It's not Gregory Quinn. It may look like him, but it isn't him. Are you absolutely certain? I'm certain. I want you to stay close. Keep your eye on his every move. Have Beverly concoct some reason for giving him a full medical exam. How? I don't know, just do it. He's a senior admiral. It's not him. I know that now. I have to find out how this happened, and who or what is behind it. If you're right... I'm right. Should you be beaming down alone, unarmed? I'll take care. Find out what you can, then join me, in force if necessary. Energize. Good luck, sir. Welcome home, Capt Picard. Thank you. My First Officer will join us shortly. Yes, I'm sure he will. You've met Cmdr Remmick. Under less-than-ideal circumstances. It's nice to see you again. We have prepared a special meal in your honor. Delightful. Why is the corridor so quiet? The last time I was here, it was bustling. It usually is. Tonight's a quiet night. Yes... a quiet night. Ready for your tour, Admiral? Quite ready, Commander. What's in the case? Actually, I brought it for Dr Crusher. Perhaps you would like to see it first? What is it? A form of life. It was discovered accidentally by surveyors on an uncharted planet. We haven't heard about that. You will, but there is much scientific study to be done. After all, it is a superior form of life. Superior? Totally. Come, have a look. I'll summon my Science Officer. It won't like your Science Officer. It does like you! Vitamins. They do wonders for the body. Riker to Security, guest quarters 17. Emergency! Let's have some Andonian tea while we wait for Riker. Then you can tell us what's brought you here. I see you keep up with our duty roster. Yes, of course. The Enterprise is very important to us. Excuse me, gentlemen. To the Horatio, gentlemen. What an awful tragedy. Such a terrible loss of life. Interestingly, the Horatio is one of the subjects I wanted to discuss. Really? Has the cause of her destruction been ascertained? Absolutely. Implosion. Due to the extreme negligence of her Captain. Enjoy, Picard. I believe you'll find it an excellent aperitif. It's good you're here. He slipped and hit his head. Lt La Forge in guest quarters 17. We have a medical emergency. Dr Crusher is most capable. He'll be alright. If you'll excuse me, my time here is most limited. Admiral. Wait till the Doctor gets here. Now, Klingon, it's between you and me. Do Klingons fear death as much as humans? I could snap your neck in a second, but it wouldn't be as much fun. Are you alright? If I could see, I'd see stars. What is he? Let's find out. Retinal scans are an exact match. It really is Quinn. How can that be? He picked me up like a rag doll. I'll have to do a complete internal scan. Keep me posted. I'll be on the bridge. What is that?! What do you know of conspiracies? Not nearly enough. That's their charm. When a machination is real, no one knows about it. And when it's suspected, it's almost never real. Except in paranoid delusions for those who believe. Sorry to interrupt. Dinner is served. Wonderful. This banter has given me an appetite. I need to contact my ship to let Riker know we're about to sit down. Of course. We'll wait for you at the table. Picard to Riker. Dr Crusher here. May I speak freely? I have little choice. Where's Riker? He was attacked by Quinn, or what we thought was Quinn. Specify, Doctor. A parasitic being has invaded Quinn's body. It has complete control over all brain functions. It seems to breathe through a small gill protruding from Quinn's neck. Look for this, Captain. I believe it will be visible on anyone who has been compromised. Any idea what it is or where it came from? Negative. I've never seen anything like it. Lt Worf, if the situation is under control, please report to the bridge. Doctor? It's OK. He won't be waking up for a long time. Continue, Doctor. By the placement of the tendrils, the parasite appears to stimulate the victim's adrenal glands, generating great strength and resistance... Ignore the details. Can you remove it? I don't think so. Not without killing the patient. You must set your phaser on kill. Stun has little effect. Doctor, one does not beam down to Starfleet Headquarters armed. Your food is getting cold. I'm going in to dinner now, Doctor. Tell Cmdr Riker to join me as soon as he's ready. Picard out. Please, sit down. We've been waiting. Go ahead and start. We don't stand on ceremony here. Do eat up, Picard! Raise your hand if you want seconds. Riker! Thank God! We're leaving. You're not going anywhere. You'll be one of us soon. You were meant for the Doctor. It couldn't be helped. Riker walked in on us unexpectedly. No matter. The Doctor will be joining us soon. All in good time. Well... Capt Scott, good. Now, the setting is complete. You don't think we were in the dark about your intentions? Patience is one of our virtues, Captain. We didn't go after you, we allowed you to come after us. More dramatic that way, don't you think? Yes, the one thing both races share is a love of theatre. And you've put on a fine show. What race are you? Where are you from? It's not important. Let us just say we've come a long way to join you. It's a perfect match. We're the brains, you're the brawn. You'll understand soon. Indeed. We've been moving cautiously for many months now, careful to cover our tracks, careful not to arouse suspicion, until it's too late. Now, it's too late. For you, that is. Well said, brother. Picard and Riker control the Enterprise, which means we control the Enterprise. Eat hearty, brother. Relish your new body. Aaron! Can I help you, gentlemen? Is there any trouble here? Perhaps if you tell me what it is. Remmick. No, Will. You don't understand. We mean you no harm. We seek peaceful coexistence! Captain's log, stardate 41780.2. How difficult after years of learning to respect life to be forced to destroy it. But there seems to be no alternative. Quinn is expected to recover fully. There is no trace of the parasite which took control of him. We'll never know how many of these life forms infiltrated Starfleet, but it seems they could not survive without the mother creature which had taken over Cmdr Remmick. It was Dr Crusher's idea to simulate the gill. It had to fool everyone, including you. That it did, rest assured. Captain, I have attempted to trace the message Remmick was sending. I believe it was aimed at an unexplored sector of our galaxy. Any idea what the message was? I believe it was a beacon. A beacon? Yes, sir. A homing beacon sent from Earth. "
S1E26,"First Officer's log, stardate 41986.0. We await the return of Capt Picard who was summoned to Starbase 718 for an emergency conference. Meanwhile, our sensors are monitoring an ancient capsule which appears to be from Earth. I wonder how it got out here. At present speed and heading, it will enter the Kazis binary system and be destroyed. I could use a tractor beam to adjust its heading. I think not. It's just debris. We only noticed it because we're waiting here. Let it be. Let nature take its course. How long until Capt Picard returns? The last communication indicated several hours. Request permission to investigate this vehicle. Why? It's a derelict. It is a piece of history. The opportunity to examine an ancient vehicle does not come often. And, as you pointed out, we do have the time. Very well. Be ready to beam back before the Captain returns. Thank you, sir. Lt Worf, go with him. Aye, sir. Minimal oxygen atmosphere. An ancient solar generator. Still operating. Commander, look at this. The on-board computers have ceased functioning. I may be able to download this disk drive to the Enterprise. Must be sealed. Probably with age. Not necessary. The seal has been broken and the environment corrupted. Here's another. This one is empty. Commander! Look at this. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Were they frozen for an extended journey? If so, there would be evidence of more sophisticated monitoring. These containers were designed solely for refrigeration. The Captain's shuttle is approaching the shuttle bay. This is the Captain. I want to go when the shuttle is secure. We'll make all preparations. Cmdr Data, return to the Enterprise immediately. We have an unusual situation, sir. There are people on board. Frozen. Frozen? How many? Three. The vehicle has suffered severe damage. Most of her systems have failed. Should they be transferred to the Enterprise? I do not believe we should leave them here, sir. With your permission, we will return with three containers. Whatever you do, do it quickly. Mr. La Forge, set course 058, mark 173. Number One, staff meeting on observation deck. Captain, those coordinates will take us into the Neutral Zone. That is correct, Mr. La Forge. Warp factor eight. Aye, sir. Warp eight. Engage. Two Federation outposts in Sector 30 have been destroyed. There's been no communication with Federation starbases in Sector 31 since stardate 41903.2. Romulans. That's the assumption. There's been no contact with the Romulans since the Tomed Incident. The questions are, why now? What's their objective? For 50 years, barely a whisper. Now, for no apparent reason, they're back with a roar. All we know of them is based on rumor or conjecture. The strategic decision... is to send one ship. The Enterprise. We could find ourselves greatly overmatched. True enough. It's a gamble. This first encounter, coming so suddenly after all this time, we assume it's a setup? If force is necessary, we will use it. But our goal is to establish relations with the Romulans. If we don't succeed, then to convince them of our resolve. The feeling at Starfleet is that they are seeking confrontation. They may want to test themselves in battle against a Federation starship. See how we've advanced. If that is so, I need to know it. I'll need a full profile. There is limited information, but I will prepare something. Computer, estimated time of arrival at the Neutral Zone? 19 hours, 28 minutes. Let's reassemble in six hours. Stay sharp, no surprises. I'd rather outthink them than outfight them. Questions? What is it, Doctor? The people from the capsule. Capsule? What people? The people Data beamed over. I wasn't aware that he had. He did. They were frozen. I thawed them. You what? What else could I do? The crypts in which they were frozen were falling apart. So, what's their condition? Right now, they're all sleeping. Each one needed minor medical attention. Minor now, but then their conditions were terminal. One had a heart problem. Another, advanced emphysema, with extensive liver damage. Most surprising of all, each had been frozen after they died. After they died? Cryonics. It was a kind of fad in the late 20th century. People feared dying. It terrified them. So, at the moment of death, they would be frozen, so that at some time in the future, when a cure had been found for what killed them, they could be thawed, healed, and sent about their business. In the case of this group, it apparently worked. Mr. Data, report to sickbay. Immediately. Look, I am never critical of any member of my staff being curious. But it's just that the timing is so... I could not leave them. Their vehicle was deteriorating. Data, they were already dead. What more could have happened to them? I see your point. At the time, it seemed the proper thing to do. Well, they're alive now. We'll have to treat them as living human beings. Alive and well and ready to be awakened. Before you wake them I want Security here. Lt Worf, report to sickbay. They're sedated, but they should be up as soon as possible. Well... then, we have no other choice. None that I can see. Welcome to the 24th century. I retrieved some information from the ancient disk I removed from their computer. Her name is Clare Raymond. Age, 35. Occupation, homemaker. Must be some kind of construction work. She died of an embolism. It was probably very sudden. Otherwise, her physical condition was excellent. His name is Ralph Offenhouse. Age, 55. Occupation, financier. Advanced cardiomyopathy. Inoperable at the time, but easily correctable now. He must've known his condition was terminal for some time. Much of his file, we could not retrieve. His name is LQ Sonny Clemonds. His occupation had something to do with music. There was marked deterioration in every system of his body. Probably massive chemical abuse. Unbelievable. Sounds like someone who hated life. Yet he had himself frozen so he could go through it all again. Too afraid to live, too scared to die. Doctor, this situation is more suited to your talents. I'll be on the bridge. Number One. Take charge of our guests until we decide what to do with them. Aye, sir. Number One... keep them out of my way. I know this is very confusing to you, so I'll attempt to explain. You are on the starship USS Enterprise. American? No. The United Federation of Planets. Earth is a member. What year is this? By your calendar, 2364. What?! My heart... Is it...? It's perfectly fine. In fact, all of you are now in excellent health. It worked. I made it. What is that? An android. You mean, a robot? There is a distinct difference between an android and a robot. And him? The one I saw before, with the... head? She means Worf. He's a Klingon. That takes a little more explanation. I paid some idiot a lot of money to freeze me when I died. I just got to hear the words. Am I alive? Yes. Absolutely. And the liver that was about to explode in my face? Perfectly sound. Excuse me, could someone tell me what's going on here? About 370 years ago, you died of a massive embolism. I don't remember anything about that. You and the others were frozen. Cryonics, you know? Freeze you now and heal you later. Yeah, I've heard of it, I just never gave it much thought. How did we get here? You were in a space module. The wacko that sold me this scam said that in orbit, there'd be no brownout. Yes, several cryonics companies fell into disrepute because power failures adversely affected their refrigeration system. Their stocks were severely depressed. The whole deal was a long shot, but I figured I'd give them the dough instead of my ex-wives! But, son, I figured it was a bunch of hooey. Hooey? As in hogwash, malarkey, jive. An intentional fabrication. There you go. You got it. Now, if you didn't contract for this, who did? It must have been my husband, Donald. If it was new and foolish, he'd pop for it. Well, it's the first thing he bought into that worked. I, for one, never had a doubt. My stock in this company must have split a dozen times by now. Actually, the process of cryonics was never more than a fad. It did not continue beyond the mid-21st century. I need to make a phone call. A phone call? Yes, I have provided for myself. I have a substantial portfolio. It's critical that I check on it. Let the bank know I'm alive and well. It's gonna be difficult at the moment. Do you at least have a copy of the Wall Street Journal? Let's take the Doctor's advice. Take this very slowly until we've adjusted. Then we'll talk to the Captain. As you know, sir, there is little available on the Romulans. Anything would be helpful. They are creatures of extremes. One moment, violent beyond description, the next, tender. They are related to the Vulcans, but as each race developed, their differences grew wider. They're intensely curious. Their belief in their own superiority is beyond arrogance. For some reason, they have a fascination with humans. That fascination, more than anything, has kept the peace. One other thing. They will not initiate anything. They will wait for you to commit yourself. Counterpunchers. Thank you, Counselor. That's quite valuable. Talk. I'd like me a thick Kansas City steak and some country fried potatoes and a mess of greens. Hell, forget all that. Give me a martini, straight up, with two olives. For the vitamins. Is something wrong? Wrong? Your computer fixed about the best martini I ever had. I might get to like this place. Let's see if the Braves are on. How do you turn on the TV? TV? Yeah, the boob tube. I'd like to see how the Braves are doing. Probably still finding ways to lose. I believe he means television, sir. That form of entertainment did not last much beyond 2040. Well, what do you guys do? You don't drink and you ain't got no TV. Must be kind of boring, ain't it? Number One. Riker, here. Would you and Mr. Data report to the bridge? At once, sir. With whom were you speaking? The Captain. Good. Would you tell him I'd like to see him as soon as it's convenient? What'll happen to us? Do we stay here? Go back to Earth? That's up to the Captain. Well, get him in here. I have to phone Geneva about my accounts. The interest alone could be enough to buy this ship. The Yankee's right. Get the big boy in here. I'll pass along your request. Excuse us. Duty calls. I understand. Come back later on. We'll find a couple of low-mileage pit woofies and help 'em build a memory. What is to be done with them, sir? I don't know. Commander, a low-mileage pit woofie? This time you've got me. I haven't a clue. They are the most unusual humans I have encountered. From what I've seen, there's not much to redeem them. How did our species survive the 21st century? Report. We are six hours from the Neutral Zone. I have been unable to make contact with any Federation colony here. How many outposts are nearby? Nine. We should assume they've been destroyed. By the Romulans? It fits their historical pattern. We've had no contact with the Romulans for 53 years, seven months, 18 days. We must consider our information out of date. So the information they have about us is also out of date. I think it's that lack of information that this is about. Go on. The Romulans want a confrontation. Specifically with us. The Enterprise? Not by name, but the Federation. They know the Federation will send their best, enabling them to see how far we have advanced in technology and technique. What are you recommending? I've no specific recommendation. Perhaps we should assume the initiative. I agree. This may be our only opportunity. We should seize it. Mr. Data? The strategy is built on a single premise. Their hostile intent. If the premise is sound, so is the proposal. If their intention isn't hostile, what is it? Capt Picard? This is Capt Picard. To whom am I speaking? Ralph Offenhouse. I need to talk to you. Number One, did you give him permission to contact me? No. He must have seen me use the comm panel. Listen, Mr. Offenhouse, we're in a very important conference. I'm sick of being put off by you and your staff! This is the worst-run ship I've been on! You should learn from the QE2. That's an efficient operation! Data, identify. What is a QE2? It was a passenger liner, which traveled Earth's Atlantic Ocean in late 20th, early 21st centuries. He's comparing the Enterprise to a cruise ship? Capt Picard, I demand that you see me! I think I have been very, very patient. I demand a phone, or a radio, or whatever else you have! Frankly, enough is enough. Especially considering what I paid for this procedure! I must contact my law... I'm Capt Picard. Excellent. Maybe we can get some things straightened out. Indeed. Those comm panels are for official ship business. So, why don't they need an executive key? Aboard a starship, that is not necessary. We are capable of self-discipline. You will refrain from using them. Just a minute... We are in a serious, potentially dangerous, situation. I'm sure it seems very important to you, but my situation is far more critical. I don't think you're aware of your situation. Or of how much time has passed. I'm fully cognizant of where I am and when. But I have more to protect than a man in your position could possibly imagine. No offence meant, but a military career was never considered to be... upwardly mobile. I must contact my lawyer. Your lawyer's been dead for centuries. Of course, I know that. But he was a full partner in a very important firm. Rest assured, that firm is still operating. That's what all this is about. A lot has changed in the past 300 years. People are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of things. We've eliminated hunger, want, the need for possessions. We've grown out of our infancy. You've got it all wrong. It has never been about possessions. It's about power. Power to do what? To control your life, your destiny. That kind of control is an illusion. Really? I'm here, aren't I? I should be dead, but I'm not. What is it? I don't know. It just started and it won't stop. I keep thinking about my boys. Counselor Troi, will you report to the guest lounge? Captain, we are approaching Science Station Delta 05. Slow to half impulse. I'm on my way. Captain, I need to see that pretty little Doctor of yours. I'll inform her. I didn't mean to come on so strong. It's just I've built my whole life on knowing what's going on. For the first time I feel... ...completely out of touch. It's making me crazy. You can understand that. It's the first thing you've said I do understand. I'll see what I can do. And please stay off the comm panels. Counselor, will you get those people under control? We can't afford this continuing distraction. Yes, sir. Hello. My name's Deanna. They sent you here to settle me down? I'm the ship's Counselor. I thought you might want to talk. The local shrink? I'm not familiar with that term. It doesn't matter. You're feeling profoundly sad. I can't stop crying. I miss my sons. And then I think, I'm here, but... they're gone. Donald, that's my husband... I love that man, but, good intentions aside, he'd mess up a free lunch. Why on Earth he ever decided to do this...? He must have thought you would've wanted it. No, I can tell you what happened. He couldn't think about going on alone. I died and he couldn't face it, so he had me frozen. In his mind, I wasn't really gone. It sounds crazy, but you had to know Donald. I wish I knew what happened to my children. Did they marry? Did they have kids? Let's see if we can find out. Computer, this is Counselor Troi. Request personal history on... What are their names? Tommy, he's eight, and Eddie is five. Full names, date and place of birth. They were born in Secaucus, that's in Jersey. Can this really work? Can this tell me what happened to them? There must be a record somewhere. There's a good chance we'll find it. Well, whether we do or not, I want to thank you for trying. Date of birth... Tommy was born February 17th. I need something to jump-start the morning and something else to shut down the night. You have no medical need. It ain't a matter of need, darling. It's a matter of survival. Sorry. Well, old Watosh'll scuffle along best he can. Where's that fella with the strange face? I beg your pardon? What's-his-name. The android fella. You mean Lt Cmdr Data? That's the one. I'll tell him you want him. Much obliged. You're just about the prettiest doctor I ever seen. Much obliged. This is amazing. It's all right here. Ten generations of your progeny. Everyone I've ever known is dead. Do you mind? I'd like to be alone. No. Not at all. You asked to see me? I'm about to go outta my mind. Sitting here just don't get it. What say you and I put on a party? A celebration? Nothing that fancy. Just some folks, some suds, and some sounds. It's just something to do. I will speak to the Captain. Great! Do that. Inquiry. You are not having as much difficulty adjusting to your circumstances as the others. You mean being on this tub, 400 years from where I started? Heck, it's the same dance, it's just a different tune. Does anybody here have a guitar? No. But the computer can replicate one. I want one while I still remember the chords. We're approaching the Neutral Zone. Report to the bridge. I must leave. What's this Neutral Zone? A buffer between the Romulan Empire and the Federation. Why does that make me nervous? I do not know. We won't be inviting these Romulans to our party. No. That would not be... appropriate. Captain's log, supplemental. We have arrived at the edge of the Neutral Zone. We will have an opportunity to learn firsthand what happened to our distant outpost. Captain, there is nothing left of outpost Delta 05. Must have been one hell of an explosion. Sensors indicate no evidence of conventional attack. Can you determine what happened? The outpost was not just destroyed. It's as though some great force scooped it off the planet. Could it have been a natural phenomenon? Insufficient information, sir. Set the course for the next station. I have spent my entire career being able to tell when the other guy's mouth is dry. There is something going on here. Something serious. The tension level on this ship has jumped up. Even if you are right, what can we do? These old boys don't need us telling them where the bear sits. Look what that fella made for me. How did he do that? He called it pattern replication. It plays real good, too. I tell you, there is a situation developing that directly affects us. All you can talk about is that guitar! They don't need us swimming in their soup. So relax and let 'em do their jobs. That may be alright for you, but I am not willing to allow my fate to be decided by others! I want to know what is going on. We are approaching Tarod IX. The condition is identical. Everyone and everything is gone. I strongly recommend we go to red alert. If the Romulans have improved their cloaking, and we'd be fools to doubt it, we should assume a more defensive posture. I agree. I recommend we go immediately to battle stations. I appreciate your advice, but it is no time for rash actions. There are three other stations to visit. Let's proceed in an orderly manner. May we at least go to yellow alert? Yes, Number One. Make it so. All decks, yellow alert. Let's see... I want to go to the... Where would the Captain be? Capt Picard is located on the main bridge. Well, then, take me to the main bridge. Captain, my sensors indicate a disturbance. It is large and moving. I cannot get a lock. Nor can I get it on the viewscreen. Shields up. I recommend we transfer power to phasers and arm the photon torpedoes. Wait. If it is Romulan, they will read our intent. It'll force them into taking a similar posture. We don't want battle. This is sufficient evidence. Outposts have been destroyed. Countless lives lost. I have a positive lock. They're disengaging their cloaking. They'll only be vulnerable for an instant as they become visible. Captain, this may be our only chance. No. Where are they? The signal is weakening. I've lost them. Damn. Mr. Data, are your sensors picking up anything? You should be detecting a disturbance. Negative, sir. We wanted to know if they'd improved cloaking. We have our answer. They wanted to determine our intent. To see if we would fire. Who the hell are they? Get that man off the bridge. Now! I'm not going anywhere. They're back. Amazing. I never thought I'd see a Romulan vessel so close. Last time we encountered them was decades ago. Cost thousands of lives. I can believe that. Stay calm, everyone. Open hailing frequencies. Captain, these are Romulans. They are without honor. They killed my parents in an attack on Khitomer when they were meant to be our allies. They believe humans and Klingons are a waste of skin. Control your emotions. Please, open hailing frequencies. Hailing frequencies open. Romulan vessel, this is Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise. Sensors indicate all of their systems are armed, sir. But they've not fired. I am Cmdr Tebok. Commander, you have crossed the Neutral Zone. This is Federation territory. It was necessary. It might be viewed as aggression. If our intent were aggression, you would not be here now. If we go to war, let us be sure it is for the right reason. We are here because our outposts, which border on the Neutral Zone, were also attacked. Destroyed in the same manner as your own. Even so, what gives them the right to enter Federation space? Silence your dog. Lt Worf's question is valid. To even ask such a question implies that we need permission. We do not. Do you think that we attacked your outposts? Once we realized the level of destruction, we knew it could not have been you. Who is responsible? They haven't got a clue. They're hoping you know. But they're too arrogant to ask. You're out of line, mister. But it's a correct assessment. We do not know who is responsible. Why entire outposts, on both sides, have been carried off. I would like to offer a proposal. An alliance? Between the Romulans and the Federation? Nothing so grandiose. Just this. Cooperation. There was an intent here. Whoever or whatever did this, is more powerful than either of us. Let's collaborate. Let's share whatever we learn about what has happened here. Agreed. On this one issue. And only if it is convenient and appropriate at the time. Because your actions are those of a thoughtful man, I'll tell you this. Matters more urgent caused our absence. Now... witness the result. Outposts destroyed. Expansion of the Federation... everywhere. Yes. We have indeed been negligent. But no more. Commander, we have made some progress here. Let's not ruin it with unnecessary posturing. Your presence is not wanted. Do you understand my meaning? We... are back. I think our lives just became a lot more complicated. Get him off my bridge. I've found something. I've located a family living just outside Indianapolis. The man's name is Thomas Raymond. That's my son's name. Tommy. Computer, let us see Thomas Raymond. Oh, my God! That's Donald. That's my husband. Actually, it's your great-great- great-great-great-grandson. He's the spitting image. Well, I have his address. When you get back you can visit him. No. I'll be out of time. A relic. Perhaps. But it's a place to start. After all, he is family. There's no denying that. Here's what I propose. I have arranged a rendezvous with USS Charleston, bound for Earth. They'll deliver you there. Then what will happen to us? There's no trace of my money. My office is gone. What will I do? How will I live? This is the 24th century. Material needs no longer exist. Then what's the challenge? The challenge, Mr. Offenhouse, is to improve yourself. To enrich yourself. Enjoy it. Well, one good thing is, since everyone's forgotten everything I ever did, it'll all be brand spanking new. I'll be a bigger hit than I ever was. Perhaps so. Anything is possible. What say you, son? You'd make a helluva sideman. That offer does present a certain fascination. Captain, I've plotted a course to intercept the Charleston. But they say they're making an extended stop at Arloff IX. Your point, Mr. La Forge? We could have our guests at Starbase 39 Sierra in five days. Take months off their journey. The extra time will allow them to acclimate before reaching Earth. It's a pity we can't take them. Having them here is like a visit from the past. That would take us in the wrong direction. Our mission is to go forward. And it's just begun. Set velocity. Warp six. Aye, sir. Warp six. There's still much to do. Still so much to learn. Engage. "
S2E01,"A Nave Repulse acabou de sair do Hangar 3. Abrir comunicaçőes. Comunicaçőes abertas. Repulse, aqui é a Enterprise. Vamos iniciar partida. Entendido. Transferęncia completa. Boa sorte em sua missăo. E para vocęs. Dę meus cumprimentos ao seu Capităo. Repulse desliga. Hangar em segurança. Obrigado, Sr. Crusher. Inicie os preparativos para partida. Nós estamos construindo o recipiente no Hangar de Carga 5. Entre. Transferęncia feita. A Doutora Pulaski está sendo acompanhada a seus aposentos. Ótimo. Veja os módulos de contençăo que o nosso Engenheiro Chefe desenhou. Engenheiro Chefe. Ainda soa bem. Cada unidade tem total controle do ambiente, gravidade, temperatura, atmosfera, e luz num campo protegido. E eles fazem parte da grande unidade de contençăo? Sim. Estes módulos văo manter os espécimes vivos, mas é a grande unidade de contençăo que nos vai manter vivos. Vou ter que duplicar isto mais de 512 vezes, o que significa que vou ter que retirar energia dos Motores de Dobra. E quando voltamos a ter energia? Dentro de duas horas. É inevitável. Quando sairmos de Audet IX, vou precisar dessa energia. E vai tę-la. Número Um, irei substituí-lo ŕs 03:00 horas. Tire-nos de órbita, Sr. Crusher. Trace curso para Audet IX. Sim, senhor. Curso para Audet IX já foi introduzido. Velocidade de impulso máxima. Sim, senhor. Ativar. Engenharia, acabei de observar o que parece ser uma transferęncia de energia casual. Onde? Atrás. Lá fora, perto dos motores. Espere. Vou verificar. Năo, năo está acusando nada aqui, Data. Algum problema? Possivelmente, senhor. Uma flutuaçăo de energia inexplicável. Me avise se voltar a se repetir. Sim, senhor. O Espaço... A Fronteira Final. Estas săo as viagens da Nave Estelar Enterprise. Em sua missăo contínua de explorar novos mundos... ...pesquisar novas vidas e novas civilizaçőes... ...audaciosamente indo onde ninguém jamais esteve. Diário do Capităo Data Estelar 42073.1 Existe um surto năo classificado de peste de plasma. no sistema Rachelis. Precisamos de espécimes desta peste mortal para transportá-las até ao Posto Científico de Tango Sierra, onde, se espera que um antídoto possa ser produzido. Como está indo? Pronto para introduzir os módulos. Número Um. O Senhor La Forge disse que poderemos ativar os Motores de Dobra daqui a uma hora. Ótimo. Sr. Data, quando tivermos a lista dos espécimes que levaremos, quero que vocę e a Doutora?... Pulaski, Senhor. Dra. Pulaski. Os confirmem. Sim, Senhor. E onde está a nossa nova Doutora? Ela já se apresentou? Ainda năo. Enfermaria, aqui fala o Capităo. Aqui é a Enfermaria. A Doutora Pulaski está aí? Năo. A Doutora está no bar. Obrigado. De nada, senhor. Há poucas horas a bordo e já encontrou o bar. Eu vou buscá-la. Năo. Eu vou. Năo é a melhor maneira de conhecer o seu novo Capităo. Hangar 10, Seçăo 1. Olá, Capităo. Navegador. Lamento que esta missăo vá atrasar o seu reencontro com sua măe. Năo faz mal. Dará mais tempo para eu terminar alguns assuntos meus. Vai ser difícil deixar a Enterprise. Sentimentos contraditórios para todos. É sempre difícil deixar qualquer nave. Como foi para sua măe quando saiu para integrar o Posto Médico da Frota Estelar. Mas ir de uma missăo para a outra faz parte da vida. Eu sei, mas esta năo é uma nave qualquer. Bem verdade. Guinan. Capităo. Onde está a Doutora Pulaski? Obrigado. Doutora Catherine Pulaski. Oh, vocę deve ser o Capităo Picard. Dra. o protocolo pode ter sido pouco relaxado em sua última missăo, mas... Sente-se, Capităo. É melhor ouvir isto. Tenente La Forge, relatório da situaçăo. Estamos colocando o último dos módulos. Dobra 6, assim que possível. Entendido. Esta é a Dra. Pulaski. Tratamos das apresentaçőes mais tarde. A Conselheira Deanna Troi está grávida. Ela... vai ter um bebę. Bebę? Isto é uma surpresa. Ainda mais para mim. Esta gravidez é totalmente diferente de qualquer outra que já vi. Desde que veio me ver, já examinei Conselheira Troi duas vezes. Este foi o primeiro exame. Já está no meio do primeiro trimestre. Tem cerca de seis semanas. Nós acreditamos que a concepçăo tenha ocorrido a 11 horas atrás. O quę? Ainda há mais. Este é o segundo exame. Foi feito depois de uma hora. Confirma o primeiro, mas neste, o feto parece mais velho algumas semanas. A este ritmo, a Conselheira Troi vai ter o bebę dentro de 36 horas. A gravidez normal para uma betazóide é de dez meses. Năo quero ser indelicado... mas sabe quem é o pai? Ontem ŕ noite, enquanto dormia, algo que só posso descrever como uma presença, entrou em meu corpo. Uma vida de origem e intençőes desconhecidas está se desenvolvendo neste momento dentro da Conselheira Troi. O nosso objetivo aqui é determinar o que vai ser feito. Năo, esperem. Se entendo, Deanna foi fecundada por... o quę? Doutora, é humanóide? É alienígena? É um macho humano. Neste caso, meio humano, meio betazóide. Exatamente igual a Deanna? Em todos os aspectos. Na realidade, apenas manifesta os genes dela. Năo creio que seja aleatório. Acho que há um motivo para isso. Qual é, eu ainda năo sei. Capităo... é óbvio que a gravidez tem que ser interrompida para segurança da nave e da tripulaçăo. Năo podemos presumir que a sua intençăo seja hostil. É a conclusăo mais segura. Capităo, trata-se de uma forma de vida. Se năo a deixarmos desenvolver-se, perdemos a oportunidade de estudá-la. Se o feto for abortado, ainda é possível analisá-lo em laboratório. Doutora, existe algum risco para a Troi se o feto for abortado? Capităo. Faça o que achar necessário para proteger esta nave e a tripulaçăo... mas saiba uma coisa, eu vou ter este bebę. Entăo parece que a discussăo terminou. Diário do Capităo Suplemento Chegamos a Audet IX, vamos recolher os espécimes da Peste de Plasma para levá-los ŕ Rachelis. Como existem muitas vidas em jogo, estou disposto a arriscar esta nave e a sua tripulaçăo. Entretanto, a gravidez da Conselheira Troi continua a desenvolver-se a um ritmo fascinante. Como se sente? Eu deveria me sentir desconfortável com as mudanças no meu corpo, mas me sinto bem. Melhor que bem. Ótima. Órbita padrăo. Abrir freqüęncias de comunicaçăo. Freqüęncias de Comunicaçăo abertas. Daqui fala o Capităo Jean-Luc Picard da USS Enterprise. A Enterprise. Finalmente chegou. Ótimo. Vamos começar. Com quem estou falando? Com quem está falando? Com o Ten. Com. Hester Deslt, do Conselho Médico, da Estaçăo de Medicina Coletiva da Federaçăo. Os espécimes estăo prontos? Sim, mas primeiro quero inspecionar a área de contençăo antes de começar. Năo é que duvide da competęncia da sua tripulaçăo, mas năo podemos cometer erros. Eu aprecio a sua cautela, e como tal, eu quero um manifesto detalhado do que tenciona trazer a bordo. Muito bem. Vou permitir que acessem os dados em meu computador, OK? Data, compare o inventário deles com o computador médico. Número Um, trate do transporte. Diário do Capităo Suplemento Já passaram cerca de 14 horas desde que chegamos a Audet IX, mas Hester Deslt ainda năo completou sua inspeçăo na unidade de contençăo. A transferęncia năo será permitida até se confirmar crescimento zero. Entretanto, a peste continua a alastrar no sistema Rachelis. Capităo, o manifesto final já foi recebido. Finalmente. Confirme-o com a Dra. Pulaski. Quero que vocęs conheçam bem. Sim senhor. Data, me ajude a chegar ŕ Enfermaria? Está na hora. Pode apostar que sim. Vamos levá-la para a Enfermaria. Worf, reúne um equipe de segurança para a Enfermaria. Isso é necessário? Sim, Doutora. Ordens do Capităo. Bom, é estranho ser necessário guardas armados numa sala de partos. Por aqui. As contraçőes estăo próximas? Muito perto. Em outros partos, o pai costuma estar presente. Dificuldades nas circunstâncias. Talvez eu sirva para a tarefa. A Conselheira Troi precisa de um toque humano e năo a măo fria da tecnologia. Doutora, eu acho que o Comandante Data servirá perfeitamente. A escolha é sua. Năo precisa fazer nada, Data. Apenas fique comigo. Năo há nenhum motivo para estar nervoso. Nervoso? Eu acho isto muito interessante. Eu compreendo, em termos técnicos, como é gerada a vida, mas fazer parte do processo é novo para mim. A criança no seu interior, vocę tem acesso a todo o seu desenvolvimento? Ele tem pensamentos? Tem noçăo de si? Quando desperta sua conscięncia? Está acontecendo. Qual é a sensaçăo? Data. Sim? Agora. Agora? Agora, Doutora. Este bebę é impaciente. Está ansioso para se apresentar. Vocę quer algo para diminuir a dor? A experięncia será a mesma. Ainda năo senti dores. Nenhuma? Năo. Nenhuma até agora. Mantenha os seus homens da segurança lá fora. Eu entendo que tenham que estar aqui, mas năo me atrapalhem. Posiçăo fetal? Normal. Pulso fetal? 137. O bebę apresenta movimentos respiratórios saudáveis. A atividade cardíaca é boa. O bebę está indo muito bem, Troi. Respire devagar. Está tudo bem. Se mantenha calma. Assim mesmo. Assim mesmo. Já o tenho. Já pode relaxar. Pronto, pronto. Que menino bonito. Meu deus, ele é lindo. Os partos săo indolores para os betazóides? De acordo com a minha măe, năo. Vocę já pode entrar. Năo existe ameaça alguma, Tenente. Já pode relaxar. É apenas um bebę. Obrigado por me deixar participar. Foi memorável. Vocę já tem um nome? Ian Andrew, como do meu pai. Vocę esteve sempre aqui? Sim. Ele é lindo, Deanna. Tal como a măe. Como está se sentindo? Bem. Maravilhosa. Obrigada por tudo, Doutora. Espantoso. Capităo. Doutora. Bem-vinda ŕ Ponte de Comando. Por favor, sente-se. Como está a... Conselheira Troi? Ela passou bem a noite? Já assisti a muitos partos, mas nenhum assim, sem dores ou traumas. É verdade. Năo houve esforço para nenhum deles. Năo estou entendendo o que quer dizer. Ela teve o bebę ontem. Se eu a examinar agora, năo seria capaz de dizer que teve um bebę. Ou que algum dia teve um bebę. Foi como se a situaçăo nunca tivesse ocorrido. Data, quanto tempo falta até a transferęncia? 2 horas, 19 minutos, senhor. Número Um, a Ponte é sua. Sim, senhor. Se importa de me acompanhar, Dra.? Por favor? Acho que é hora de prestar os meus respeitos. Entre. Deanna, eu queria ver como vocę está e ver o seu... ...bebę. Meu Deus. Com qual idade ele está? Na realidade, um dia. Sim, mas... Em aparęncia, 4 anos terrestres. Ian, diga olá ao Capităo Picard. Quer dizer que ele fala? Olá. Olá, Ian. Năo se preocupe. Está tudo bem. Diário do Capităo Suplemento Nós temos 2 grandes problemas. A criança de Troi e a perigosa carga que estamos prestes a transportar. Poucas horas depois do seu nascimento, o filho da Troi continua a crescer e parece, fisicamente e mentalmente, como uma criança de oito anos. Ainda năo temos qualquer indicaçăo de quem é ou porque está aqui. Enfermaria, aqui é a ponte. Estamos prontos para carregar os dados. Precisamos de mais algum tempo para catalogar os espécimes. Dhata, olhe isso. Data. O quę? O meu nome. Se pronuncia Data. Me chamou de Dahta. E qual é a diferença? Um é o meu nome. O outro năo. Isto é possível? Com todas as suas redes neurais, algorítmicas e heurísticas? Será possível que alguma combinaçăo desencadeie sentimentos de mágoa? Possível? Năo estou familiarizada com este símbolo. Indica uma forma de vida biológica geneticamente alterada. Cerca de 20% dos espécimes encaixam nessa categoria. Algum tipo de ""Igger Beaver"" agindo. Pergunta. ""Igger Beaver""? Neste caso, Igger Beaver refere-se a um extraordinário engenheiro genético, que, provavelmente por năo ter mais nada que fazer, forçou este tipo de vírus a sofrer uma mutaçăo. Apenas para ver o quăo devastador poderia ser. Capităo Picard? Picard. Eu gostaria que soubesse quais os riscos que vamos correr. Continue. Se algum destes espécimes se libertarem, destruirăo toda a vida na Enterprise em poucas horas. Eu compreendo, Doutora. Alguma recomendaçăo? Considerando o quăo desesperadamente necessitam disto, năo. Năo tenho. Apenas queria que soubesse o que estamos transportando. Obrigado. Comandante Data, vocę é necessário na Sala de Transporte 3. Sim, senhor. Com licença, Doutora. Năo faz mal, Dahta... Data. Como seja. Ele é uma criança curiosa. Ele quer tocar em tudo. É hora de irmos, querido. Inacreditável. Acho que ele cresceu desde que vocę o deixou aqui. Eu gosto de ficar aqui, măe. Imaginei que sim. Agradeça a senhora Gladstone e vamos comer alguma coisa. Obrigado. Autorizaçăo para bio-transporte completa. Hangar de Carga 5, vamos começar a transportar assim que ordenado. Transporte 3, estamos prontos para receber. O primeiro lote já está no lugar, estamos prontos para o próximo. Me Informe quando a carga estiver carregada e em segurança. Sim, senhor. Entre. Eu queria ver como é que o Ian está indo. Estamos bem. Estava preparando o jantar. Também quer jantar? Năo, Ian, mas obrigado pelo convite. De nada. Já brincou com cachorrinhos? Tiveram uma ninhada no berçário. Năo, Ian, acho que nunca brinquei. Deveria ir até ao berçário enquanto os cachorrinhos estăo lá. Talvez mais tarde. Măe. Me deixe ver isso. Năo está muito mau. A minha cara está molhada. Assim está melhor, querido? Vai ficar tudo bem. Ele se queimou de propósito. Para experimentar. Quem é ele? Porque está aqui? O que é que ele quer? Ian, poderia nos dizer por que está aqui? A mamăe disse que estava na hora de comer. Năo, eu quero dizer, por que está aqui nesta nave? Eu moro aqui. Ian, acho que o Capităo quer saber se vocę está pronto para nos dizer por que veio para aqui. Năo, ainda năo. A resposta está dentro dele. Quando ele tiver desenvolvido todas as suas capacidades, ele nos dirá. Espero que seja em breve. A carga foi carregada e colocada em segurança. Entăo, tire-nos de órbita, Número 1. Trace um curso para Rachelis, Dobra 6. Precisa de alguma coisa? Năo, nada. Apenas gosto de ficar aqui. Năo te censuro. É bonito. E que tal uma xícara de chă Mareuviano? Năo, nada. Obrigado. Vocę irá embora em breve. O que vę quando vocę olha lá para fora? O Lorenze Cluster, e ali está Arneb, e ali está Epsilon Indi. Năo. Quero dizer, quando olha lá para fora, năo vę seu futuro? E vai continuar lá fora. E que tal uma xícara de néctar vinda diretamente de Prometheus? Năo, năo quero. É a terceira vez que me pergunta. Năo é isso que esperam de mim? Năo faz sempre aquilo que é esperado? Eu tento. Mesmo que năo seja aquilo que realmente quer? Ŕs vezes. Ŕs vezes é mais importante considerar os outros antes de si próprios. Sim. Mas, ás vezes, é bom poder pensar em nós primeiro. Se dar ao luxo de ser egoísta. Algo está errado. O que é? Crescimento. Onde? L-73. Aqui é o Hangar de Carga 5. Sim, La Forge? Capităo, temos um mal-funcionamento na área de contençăo. Muito sério? Muito. Diário do Capităo Suplemento Por razőes ainda desconhecidas, um dos espécimes mortais da Peste de Plasma começou a crescer. Relatório, Sr. La Forge. Capităo, năo há nenhum motivo para isto estar acontecendo. Nem sequer consigo isolar a causa. Data, é melhor irmos lá baixo. Doutora Pulaski. Sim, Capităo? Problemas na área de carga cinco. A sua presença é necessária. Já estou a caminho. Nunca fala sobre vocę. Claro que falo. Muitas vezes. As pessoas dizem que é muito velha. E que conheceu o Capităo Picard quando ele estava na Stargazer. Năo, nunca o conheci antes de vir ŕ bordo. Todos estăo curiosos sobre vocę. Aposto que sim. Sim, querem saber de onde vocę veio. E de onde dizem que sou? Bom, dizem que vocę é de Nova Kron e... Sr. Crusher, venha até a Ponte. Sim, senhor. Tenho que ir. Obrigado. Por um prato de suflę Deloviano? Năo, năo pelo suflę. Quero dizer... pelo resto. É para isso que aqui estou. Obrigado. Adeus. Por quę este módulo e năo os outros? Computador, verifique o módulo L-73. Todos os circuitos funcionais. Ambiente conforme programado, temperatura de 97 graus Kelvin, fluxo de radiaçăo zero, campo de estase normal, tudo conforme deveria de estar, tudo conforme o livro. Talvez exista um sensor avariado. Computador, pergunta. Está realmente ocorrendo um crescimento em L-73? Confirmado. Doutora um espécime está crescendo. Destrua-o agora. Năo posso. Data, prepare para ejetar o módulo. Năo podemos fazer isso. Ele iria se tornar um esporo e entraria em contato com um planeta ou com outra nave, e os resultados seriam desastrosos. Comandante, está dizendo que o que eu achava ruim, na verdade é bem pior? Isto năo vai contę-lo. Explique. Dentro de 30 minutos, vai conseguir sair do seu módulo. Vai sair da área de contençăo em duas horas. Năo. ele năo conseguirá sair disto. Sim, ele conseguirá. Capităo, nós podemos năo ser capazes de controlar esta situaçăo. Recomendo que se transfira o pessoal năo essencial para a Seçăo Disco. Se perdermos a contençăo, temos que estar preparados para a separaçăo. Faça isso. Porquę apenas este espécime e nenhum dos outros? Algo está o estimulando. Sabe como ele foi desenvolvido? Sim, está aqui mesmo. É um tipo mutante desenvolvido durante um surto de Peste de Plasma há 70 anos no sistema Oby. Este foi nono numa série de 58 testes. Este teste, foi bombardeado por níveis baixos de radiaçăo Eichner. A exposiçăo ŕ radiaçăo Eichner poderia estimular o crescimento? Poderia, mas eu... Eu encontrei algo. Porque năo detectou isto antes? Năo sei. Năo estava aqui antes. Mas está agora. O que emite este tipo de radiaçăo? Um reversor de fase subatômico. Năo temos disso. Alguns cianoacrilatos. O que mais? Pois está por aqui. E temos que o encontrar. Sinto que algumas das pessoas estăo preocupadas. Eu também, mas năo se preocupe. Sou eu, mamăe. Sou eu a causa. O quę? Sou eu. Vocę? Sim. Tenho que ir embora agora, ou vai será mau para todos. O que está dizendo? Tenho que ir embora agora. Ir embora? Vocę vai morrer. Năo, năo pode. Enfermaria, aqui é a Conselheira Troi. Preciso da Doutora em meus aposentos. Ian. Ian, năo. É o Ian. Rápido. O que aconteceu? Ele comeu alguma coisa? Ele caiu? Năo. Comandante, a criança é a origem da radiaçăo anormal. Ele disse que era por sua causa que a nave estava em perigo. Essa análise está correta. Estou perdendo os sinais vitais. Vocę tem que salvá-lo. Lamento... Comandante Riker, o campo de contençăo está... estabilizado. Obrigado, Tenente. Entăo, Ian tinha razăo. Ele era a causa. Aparentemente sim. Ele é uma entidade de força viva. Quando passamos próximos no espaço, ele ficou curioso sobre nós. Ele decidiu que a melhor forma de aprender era passar por todo o processo. Nascer, viver como um de nós, para desse modo, nos compreender. Ele nunca quis fazer mal a ninguém. Ouve um momento em que vocę sorriu. Ele disse, ""Obrigado."" Eu te disse que iríamos sentir a falta dele. E eu vou. Órbita padrăo, Sr. Crusher. Sim, senhor. Órbita padrăo. Sala de Transporte 3, aqui fala o Capităo. Vamos proceder a transferęncia com a maior rapidez possível. Sim, senhor. Ficarei contente por estar livre desta carga. O comando é seu, Número Um. Capităo? Podemos conversar quando estiver disponível? No meu Gabinete, após seu turno. Obrigado, senhor. Quanto tempo até criar uma vacina? Podemos nunca chegar a criar uma. Tudo isto por nada? Esperemos que năo. Preparar para energizar. Boa sorte. Data, pode travar no primeiro grupo e começar a transferęncia. Entre. Capităo Picard, pensei muito sobre isto. Eu quero ficar a bordo da Enterprise. Já contou isto para sua măe? Năo, senhor. Antes de contar, queria a sua permissăo para ficar. Wesley, isso é... um pouco mais complicado do que parece. Capităo... é aqui que eu quero estar. É por isso que eu sinto que pertenço a este lugar. Capităo a transferęncia está completa. Prontos para deixar órbita. Faça isso, Número Um. Regresse ao seu posto. Todos os sistemas operacionais. Tire-nos de órbita, Sr. Crusher. Trace rumo para o Quadrante Morgana. Sim, senhor. O Alferes Crusher pediu para ficar aqui na Enterprise. Năo estou surpreso. E o que decidiu? Ainda năo decidi. Năo achei que a responsabilidade fosse só minha. A sua estadia vai criar algumas dificuldades ŕ todos. Sim, certamente. Quem vai ver se está estudando? Exatamente. É claro que essa responsabilidade será do Comandante Data. Quem vai colocá-lo na cama ŕ noite? Ora, Comandante. Eu aceito esta responsabilidade. Bom, agora sabemos que ele irá descansar. Acho que isso basta como aprendizado, mas podemos acrescentar algo mais. Acredito que o Número Um é o mais qualificado para supervisioná-lo. Está disposto em fazę-lo? Uma decisăo difícil. Sim, eu posso fazę-lo. Senhor Crusher, entre em contato com sua măe. Diga a ela que tem a minha permissăo para ficar na Enterprise, mas concordarei com o que ela decidir. Sim, senhor. Obrigado, senhor. Eu sei que ela vai concordar. Agora, se já tiver com o curso e a velocidade inseridas... Sim, senhor. Já estăo. Entăo Sr. Crusher... Ativar. "
S2E01,"Repulse shuttle has cleared docking bay three. Open hailing frequencies. Hailing frequencies open. This is the Enterprise. We are getting under way. Acknowledged. Transfer complete. Good luck on your mission. And to you. Give my regards to your Captain. Repulse out. Shuttle bay secure. Thank you, Mr. Crusher. Make preparations to get under way. We're constructing the enclosure on cargo deck five. Come. The transfer's complete. Dr Pulaski is being shown to her quarters. Grand. Look at the containment module our Chief Engineer designed. Chief Engineer. It still has a nice ring to it. Each unit has total environmental control, gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light, in a protective field. These go into the large containment unit? Right. See, these modules will keep the specimens alive, but it's the large containment area that will keep us alive. I have to replicate this 512 times, which means I have to divert power from the warp engines. So how long on impulse power? A couple of hours. Can't be helped. When we leave 'audet IX, I'm going to need that power. You'll have it. Number One, I'll relieve you at 0300. Take us out of orbit, Mr. Crusher. Set course for 'audet IX. Aye, sir. Course for 'audet IX has been input. Maximum impulse velocity. Aye, sir. Engage. Engineering, I have just observed what appeared to be a random energy transference. Where? Aft. Outboard of the port nacelle. Hold on. I'll check. No, I show nothing here, Data. Problem? Possibility, sir. An unexplained power fluctuation. Let me know if it reoccurs. Aye, sir. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilisations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 42073. 1. There is an unclassified plasma plague outbreak in the Rachelis system. We need specimens of the deadly plague to transport them to Science Station Tango Sierra, where, hopefully, an antidote can be produced. How's it going? Ready to insert the modules. Number One. Lt La Forge says we can engage the warp drive within the hour. Grand. Mr. Data, when we have a list of specimens we will carry, I want you and Dr...? Pulaski, sir. Dr Pulaski. Go through them. Aye, sir. Where is our new Doctor? Has she reported in? Not yet. Sickbay, this is the Captain. Sickbay, aye. Is Dr Pulaski there? No. The Doctor is in ten-forward. Thank you. Aye, sir. A few hours on board and she's found ten-forward. I'll go get her. No. I'll go. Not the best way to meet your new Captain. Deck ten, forward station one. Hello, Captain. Ensign. I'm sorry this mission will delay your reunion with your mother. That's alright. It gives me time to finish some projects I have to do. It's going to be hard leaving the Enterprise. Mixed feelings for all of us. It's always hard leaving any ship. Just as it was for your mother, leaving to head Starfleet Medical. But moving from one assignment to another is part of this life. I know, but this isn't any ship. How true. Guinan. Captain. Where is Dr Pulaski? Thank you. You must be Capt Picard. Doctor, protocol may have been lax on your last assignment... Sit down, Captain. You should hear this. Lt La Forge, status report. The last of the modules are being inserted. Warp six as soon as possible. Acknowledged. This is Dr Pulaski. We'll handle the formal introductions later. Counsellor Deanna Troi is pregnant. She... is going to have a baby. Baby? This is a surprise. More so for me. This pregnancy is unlike any I have ever encountered. Since she came to me, I have done two examinations of Counsellor Troi. This is the first examination. This is halfway through the first trimester. About six weeks old. Now, understand we believe conception took place 11 hours ago. What? It gets better. This is the second exam, one hour later. It's consistent, except that the foetus appears several weeks older. At this rate, Counsellor Troi will have her baby in about 36 hours. The normal gestation rate for a Betazoid is ten months. I don't mean to be indelicate... but who's the father? Last night, while I slept, something which I can only describe as a presence entered my body. A life form of unknown origin and intent is breeding right now inside Counsellor Troi. Our purpose here is to determine what is to be done. No, wait. Let me get this straight. Deanna was impregnated by... what? Doctor, is it a humanoid? An alien? It's a male human or, in this case, half-human, half-Betazoid. Exactly the same as Deanna? In every way. In fact, nothing indicates any genetic patterns other than hers. I don't think this is random. I think there is a reason. What, I don't know. Captain,... obviously, the pregnancy must be terminated, for the safety of the ship and crew. You can't assume the intent was belligerent. That is the safest assumption. Captain, this is a life form. Not to allow it to develop naturally will deny us a study opportunity. If the foetus is aborted, laboratory analysis is still possible. Doctor, is there any health risk to Troi if the foetus is aborted? Do whatever is necessary to protect the ship and crew, but know this. I'm going to have this baby! Then it seems that the discussion is over. Captain's log, supplemental. We have arrived at 'audet IX, where we will pick up the specimens of plasma plague. Because so many lives are at stake, I am willing to put this ship and crew at great risk. Meanwhile, Counsellor Troi's pregnancy continues to progress at an astonishing rate. How are you feeling? I should feel uncomfortable with the changes in my body, but I feel fine. Better than fine. Wonderful. Standard orbit. Open hailing frequencies. Hailing frequencies open. This is Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise. The Enterprise. Here at last. Good. Let's get going. To whom am I speaking? To whom are you speaking? Lt Cmdr Hester Dealt, Medical Trustee, Federation Medical Collection Station. Are the specimens ready? Yes, but I would like to inspect the containment area before we proceed. It's not that I doubt the ability of your crew, but we cannot afford a mistake. I appreciate your caution. In the like vein, I want a complete detailed manifest of what you plan to bring on board. Very good. I will allow you access to my computer banks, OK? Data, cross-reference their inventory to the medical computer. Number One, arrange the transportation. Captain's log, supplemental. It's been nearly 14 hours since we arrived at 'audet IX, but Hester Dealt has not completed inspection of the containment unit. A transfer will not be permitted until he's assured of zero growth. Meanwhile, the desperate pleas from the Rachelis system continue. Captain, the final manifest has been received. At last. Review it with Dr Pulaski. I want you both familiar with it. Data, will you help me get to sickbay? It's time. You bet it is! Let's get you to maternity. Worf, assemble a security team in sickbay. Is that necessary? Yes, Doctor. Captain's orders. Well, it's strange to need armed guards in a delivery room. This way. How frequent are your contractions? Very close. In other deliveries, the father is often present. Difficult in the circumstances. I could serve in that capacity. Counsellor Troi needs a human touch, not the cold hand of technology. Doctor, I think Cmdr Data will do very nicely. Your choice. You don't have to do anything, Data. Just be with me. There's nothing to be nervous about. Nervous? I find this very interesting. I understand, in technical terms, how life is formed, but part of the process eludes me. The child inside you, are you able to access his thought process? Does he have thoughts? Is he aware of you? When does awareness begin? It's happening! How does it feel? Now! Now? Now! Doctor! This is an impatient baby. He's eager to make his appearance. Do you want something for the pain? It won't diminish the experience. I have felt no pain. None? No. None at all. Have your Security men stand back. I understand you have to be here, but keep out from underfoot. Foetal position? Normal. Foetal pulse? 137. The baby shows healthy respiratory movements. The action of the heart rate is good. The baby's doing wonderfully, Troi. Breathe slowly. You're doing great. Stay calm. That's it. There it is. I've got him. You can relax. There, there. That's a good boy. He's beautiful! Are easy births the norm for Betazoids? Not according to my mother. You can come in now. There's no threat, Lieutenant. You can relax. It's just a baby. Thank you for letting me participate. It was remarkable. Do you have a name? Ian Andrew, after my father. Were you here all along? Yes. He's beautiful, Deanna. Just like his mother. How do you feel? Fine. Wonderful. Thank you, Doctor, for everything. Amazing. Doctor! Welcome to the bridge. Please sit down. How is... Counsellor Troi? Did she have a good night? I've delivered dozens of babies, but none with no pain or trauma. It's true. It was effortless for both. I'm not sure of your point. She had her baby yesterday. If I examined her now, I couldn't tell if she'd ever had a baby! It was as if the incident never happened. Data, how long before the transfer? Two hours, 19 minutes, sir. Number One, take the bridge. Aye, sir. You will accompany me, Doctor? Please? I think it's time I paid my respects. Come in. I wanted to see how you were and have a look at your... ..baby! My goodness! How old is he? In actuality, a day. Yes, but... In appearance, four Earth years. Ian, say hello to Capt Picard. You mean he can talk? Hello. Hello, Ian. Please don't worry. Everything is OK. Captain's log, supplemental. We have two major problems. Troi's child and the deadly cargo we're about to take on. In the hours since his birth, Troi's baby has continued his rapid growth, and appears, physically and mentally, to be a child of eight. Still there is no indication as to who he is or why he is here. Sickbay, we are ready to begin loading. We need a little more time to categorise these specimens. Dahta, look at this. Data. What? My name. It is pronounced Data. You called me Dahta. What's the difference? One is my name. The other is not. Is this possible? With all your neural nets, algorithms and heuristics? Does some combination make up a circuit for hurt feelings? Possible? I am unfamiliar with this symbol. It indicates a genetically engineered biological life form. About 20 percent of the specimens fall into that category. Some eager beaver at play. Inquiry. Eager beaver? In this case, eager beaver refers to some overachieving genetic engineer, who, probably because of lack of anything better to do, has forced this strain of virus to mutate, just so we can see how bad bad can get. I want you to know what risks we're about to take. Go on. If any specimen gets loose, it will destroy all life on the Enterprise in a matter of hours. I understand, Doctor. Do you have a recommendation? Considering how desperately this is needed, no, I don't. I wanted you to know what we were carrying. Thank you. Cmdr Data, you are needed in transporter room three. Aye, sir. Excuse me, Doctor. That's alright, Dahta... Data. Whatever. He's very tactile. He wants to touch everything. It's time to go, sweetheart. Unbelievable! I think he's actually grown since you dropped him off. I like it here. I thought you would. Thank Miss Gladstone. Let's go get something to eat. Thank you. Bio-transport authorisation complete. Cargo deck five, we will commence transportation on your command. Transporter three, we are ready to receive. The first batch is in place, and we're ready for the next. Inform me when the cargo is loaded and secure. Aye, sir. Come in. I wanted to see how Ian was doing. We're doing fine. I was about to get his supper. Do you want your supper, too? No, Ian, but thank you for the invitation. You're welcome. Have you ever played with puppies? They had a litter in the nursery. No, Ian, I don't think I have. Come to the nursery while the puppies are there. Perhaps later. Mom! Let me see that. That's not so bad. My face is wet. Is that better, sweetheart? Everything's going to be fine. He allowed himself to be burned. For the experience. Who is he? Why is he here? What does he want? Ian, could you tell us why you are here? Mommy said it was time to eat. No, I mean, why are you here on this ship? I live here. The Captain wants to know if you're ready to tell us why you came here. No, not yet. The answer is within him. When his cognitive powers have developed, he will articulate it. I hope that's soon. Cargo has been loaded and is secure. Then take us out of orbit. Set a course for Rachelis, warp six. Can I get you something? No, nothing. I just like to stand here. I don't blame you. It's beautiful. How about a cup of Mareuvian tea? No, nothing. Thank you. You'll be leaving soon. What do you see when you look out there? The Lorenze Cluster, and there's Arneb, and there's Epsilon Indi. No. I mean, when you look out there, don't you see your future? It'll still be there. What about a cup of nectar direct from Prometheus? No, nothing. That's the third time you've asked me. It's what I'm expected to do. Don't you always do what's expected? I try. Even if it's not what you really want? Sometimes. Sometimes it's more important to consider others before yourself. Yes. But sometimes the game is to know when to consider yourself first. Give yourself permission to be selfish. Something's wrong! What is it? Growth! Where? L-73. This is cargo deck five. Yes, La Forge? Captain, we have a malfunction in the containment area. How serious? Very. Captain's log, supplemental. For reasons as yet unknown, one of the deadly specimens of plasma plague has begun to grow. Report, Mr. La Forge. Captain, there is no reason for this to be happening. I can't even isolate the cause. Data, we better get down there. Dr Pulaski. Yes, Captain? A difficulty on cargo deck five. Your presence is requested. I'm on my way. You never talk about yourself. Sure I do. All the time. People say you're very old. And that you knew Capt Picard when he was on the Stargazer. No, I never knew him till I came on board. Everyone's very curious about you. I bet they are. Yeah, they wanna know where you're from. Where do they say? Well, they say that you're from Nova Kron and... Mr. Crusher, to the bridge. Aye, sir. Gotta go. Thanks. For a dish of Delovian soufflé? No, not for the soufflé. I meant... for the rest. That's why I'm here. Thanks. Bye. Why this module and not the others? Computer, run diagnostic on module L-73. All circuits functional. Environment's as programmed, temperature 97 degrees Kelvin, radiation flux zero, stasis field nominal, everything as it should be, right down the line. Perhaps it is a sensor malfunction. Computer, inquiry. Is growth actually occurring in L-73? Confirmed. Doctor, one specimen is growing. Destroy it now. I can't. Prepare to jettison the module. We can't do that. It will remain until it comes into contact with a planet or another ship. The results would be disastrous. You're saying no matter how bad I think it is, it's actually worse? This won't hold it. Go on. Within 30 minutes, it's going to push out of its module. It will break out of the containment area. No. It can't break through this! Yes, it will. Captain, we may not be able to get control of this situation. Recommend transfer of nonessential personnel to the saucer section. If we lose containment, we should prepare to separate. Make it so. Why this one specimen and none of the others? Something is stimulating it. Do you know how it was developed? Yes, it's right over here. It's a mutated strain developed during an outbreak of plasma plague 70 years ago in the Oby system. It was ninth in a series of 58 tests. This particular test was bombarded by low levels of Eichner radiation. Could exposure to Eichner radiation stimulate growth? It could, but l... I've got something! Why didn't you detect this before? I don't know. It wasn't here before. It is now. What emits that type of radiation? A subspace phase inverter. We don't have one. Certain cyanoacrylates. What else? It's here. We better find it! I feel that some of the people are very worried. I feel it, too, but don't you worry. It's me, Mommy. I'm the reason. What? It's me. You? Yes. I have to leave you now, or it will be bad for everyone. What are you saying? I have to leave now. Leave? You're going to die! No, you can't! Sickbay! This is Counsellor Troi. I need the Doctor in my quarters! It's Ian! Hurry! What happened? Did he eat anything? Did he fall? No. Commander, the child is the source of the unusual radiation. He said he's why the ship is in danger. That analysis is correct. I'm losing life signs. You must save him! I'm sorry. Cmdr Riker, the containment field has... stabilised! Thank you, Lieutenant. Then Ian was right. He was the cause. Apparently so. He is a life-force entity. When we passed each other in space, he was curious about us. He decided the best way to learn was to go through the process, to be born, to live as one of us and, in that way, to understand us. He never meant any harm. There was a moment when you smiled. He said, ""Thank you."" I told him we will miss him. And I will. Standard orbit, Mr. Crusher. Aye, sir. Standard orbit. Transporter room three, this is the Captain. Let's make this transfer with all deliberate speed. Aye, sir. I'll be glad to be relieved of this cargo. You have the bridge, Number One. Could I see you when you're free? In my ready room. Thank you, sir. How long will a vaccine take? We may never develop one. All this was in vain? Let's hope not. Stand by to energise. Good luck. Data, you can lock on to the first group and begin transporting. Come. Capt Picard, I've thought about this a lot. I want to remain on the Enterprise. Have you told your mother? No, sir. Before I do, I'd like your permission to stay. Wesley, it's a little more complicated than that. Captain... This is where I want to be. This is where I feel I belong. Captain, transfer complete, we are ready to leave orbit. Make it so, Number One. Return to your position. All systems secure. Take us out of orbit, Mr. Crusher. Set course for Morgana Quadrant. Ensign Crusher has requested to remain on the Enterprise. I'm not surprised. How did you respond? I haven't yet. I didn't think it was my responsibility alone. His remaining will create difficulties for us all. Yes, indeed. Who will see to his studies? Exactly. Of course, that duty will fall to Cmdr Data. Who will tuck him in at night? Come on, Commander. I will accept that responsibility. Well, we know he'll get his sleep. That's the practical, but there's more to growing up than that. Number One, you are best qualified to supervise that. Are you willing to serve? Difficult decision. Yes, I can do that. Mr. Crusher, communicate with your mother. Tell her you have my permission to remain on the Enterprise, but I will abide by her wishes. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. I know she'll agree. If you have course and speed laid in... Yes, sir, they are. Then, Mr. Crusher,... engage. "
S2E02,"You're worried. With reason. About Worf or Cmdr Riker? Both. I think it is perhaps best to be ignorant of certain elements of Klingon psyche. Above! Look out! The exercise is over! At ease, Lieutenant! Exit, holodeck. You do this every day? No, Commander. Usually, my callisthenics are more... intense. But those sessions are too personal to be shared. I'll bet they are. Computer, program complete. Save. Coming, Commander? Right behind you. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilisations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 42193.6. We're bound for Morgana Quadrant, which has yet to be visited by a manned Federation vessel. We are using the time to detail the charts of this region. There it is again, sir. An area of blackness. It appears, disappears, then reappears. No predictable pattern. On screen. There it is. I can't see anything. Magnify section 285. There it is, sir. It's... Like a hole in space. We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... This appears quite different. What do your sensors indicate? Nothing, sir. Nothing? Mr. Data, you must mean it's empty of matter. There's always some energy at work. Sensors show this to be the absence of everything. A void without matter or energy. Yet this hole has a form. Height, width. Perhaps. Perhaps not, sir. That's hardly a scientific observation. Captain, the most elementary and valuable statement in science, the beginning of wisdom, is ""I do not know."" I do not know what that is, sir. Captain, if this were any ordinary kind of hole in space, wouldn't we see what's behind it? Counsellor? I know what you're asking, but I feel nothing from it. Data, is there any record anywhere of any occurrence similar to this? Accessing. Negative, sir. No record of any Federation vessel encountering anything like this. Indeed. I believe we have time to take a closer look, Number One. Concur. Ensign, slow down to half impulse power. Adjust co-ordinates to intercept... whatever this is. Scanning and recording as we go. Aye, sir. Adjusting course to intercept in... 12 minutes. Let's launch a probe into it. Worf, prepare a scanner probe. This is close enough. Hold this position. Aye, sir. Holding this position. Fire probe when ready, Mr. Worf. All probe systems are functioning perfectly, sir. It's gone! Data, what happened? Unknown, sir. Recommend we go to yellow alert. Why? Explain. Sorry, sir. It's... Mr. Worf, this starship operates best when my officers say what's on their minds. My thoughts... were of an old Klingon legend of... ..a gigantic black space creature which was said to devour entire vessels. Devour vessels? Sorry, Commander. I agree, these are thoughts hardly worthy of a trained and practical Security Officer. Mr. Worf, will you launch another probe? A class-1 with full sensor array. Launching, sir. Happened even more quickly. Recommend photon torpedo. Negative. Captain, I've been able to plot the outer boundaries. I could move in closer. Make it so, Mr. Crusher. Thrusters only. Mr. Data? Still no readings of any kind, sir. Number One? I'm going with Worf on this one. Let's be careful. Alright. That's enough, Ensign. Hold these coordinates. Aye, sir. What's happened? Data? Whatever it is, sir, we seem to be inside it. It enveloped us. It moved. All stations, report. No response, Captain. Captain's log, supplemental. While exploring a strange void in space without any matter or energy, we have apparently moved past its boundary and entered it. After a brief disruption, communications have returned to normal. All stations have reported. Appears to be no immediate threat. Let's hold this position. It's worth studying. Incredible. It's like looking into infinity. Remember the ancient history course at Starfleet Academy? About when men believed the Earth was flat? And the sun revolved around it? And that a ship could fall off the edge of the world? ""Beyond this place, there be dragons."" It's even said that crews threatened to hang their captain if he refused to turn back. I'm sure no one here has that in mind, sir. How comforting, Number One. Captain. We have no communications outside of the void. Complete scans, Data. Let's stay no longer than we must. Doctor, have you been briefed on what's happened? I heard, but I don't understand it. Wish I could say I did. Increase magnification by ten. By 100. Isn't this impossible, sir? I'm not a bridge officer, but... Increase by... 1,000, Mr. Data. By 10,000. It does know how to do these things, doesn't it? Cmdr Data knows precisely what he's doing. Forgive me, Mr. Data. I'm not accustomed to working with non-living devices that... Forgive me again. Your service record says that you are alive. I must accept that. Engineering. Are all systems functioning? Yes, Captain. Wherever we are is having no effect on Engineering. Thank you. Data? Difficult to judge with no information. Speculate. This void has a total lack of dimension. Therefore, by all standards, it does not exist. Yet being within it denies that conclusion. Might we have moved into another dimension? Could a lack of dimension be another dimension in itself? That's an interesting question. For a later discussion. We should get on with our mission. Starfleet can send a science vessel to investigate further. Move us back out. Aye, sir. Reverse direction. Set course for Cornelian star system. Impulse power. Aye, sir. Reversing direction. Course laid in. Engage. Your engines have engaged? Aye, sir. Lt La Forge, I'd like you to monitor our velocity closely. Is everything alright? Are the engines operating normally? Yes, sir. Everything looks fine here. We're increasing to warp two. Aye, sir. We should be seeing stars by now. Data, how far have we come? Inertial guidance shows 1.4 parsecs travelled, Captain. Ensign? Confirmed, sir. Exactly what my readings say. Engineering, transfer to bridge. What's happening, sir? We should be clear. We should be. We're on a reverse course. Full stop, helm. Full stop, sir. This says we're past the point at which we entered the void. But we are still in it, sir. Captain. If we dropped a stationary beacon, we would have a fixed point of reference to confirm speed and distance. Make it so. Lock onto it. Keep it dead astern. The beacon is in place. Dead ahead. Impulse power. The beacon is falling astern. Engineering, report. All systems functioning normally. Prepare to increase to warp two. Aye, sir. Captain, we're receiving a signal from dead ahead. Maybe you've found the door out of this. Closing on the new signal, sir. Identify. Captain, it is the stationary beacon we just released. We've come full circle, sir. We couldn't have, sir. I've shown us moving steadily away from it. Full stop. Hold this position again. Captain, sensors indicate a disturbance in sector 108. Possibly a vessel. Perhaps some answers at last. On screen. The ship is equipped with a cloaking device. Romulan! It's closing! Shields up. Red alert. I'll be at my duty station. Viewer locked onto coordinates. Arm photon torpedoes, Mr. Worf. Hold for my orders. There! It's uncloaking! Direct hit, sir. Our shields are weakening. Warn them we'll return fire. Transmitting. They've armed another full spread, sir. Fire torpedoes. Oh, that was too easy. Our sensors show no debris from the Romulan vessel. Impossible. Another vessel approaching. Sector 091, mark 26. On screen. Magnify. It's a Federation ship. NCC 1305-E. It's the Yamato, our sister ship. The Yamato's nowhere near here. Open a hailing frequency, Data. USS Enterprise to USS Yamato. Respond, please. USS Enterprise calling USS Yamato. Respond, please, on this frequency. No response, Captain. Make a full scan. Life-support system, engineering and propulsion appear functional. But there are no life signs. Can it be a false reading? As we know nothing of these circumstances, it is conceivable. You look doubtful, sir. I'm not anything, Number One. I'm just a man looking for answers. Like the rat said, ""Keep the cheese."" ""I just want out of the trap."" Request permission to board the Yamato with an away team. Something on board might explain what happened. Granted. Minimal complement. Worf, you're with me. Captain's log, supplemental. We remain like a fly in amber, trapped in the void. We have encountered what appears to be the USS Yamato. All systems show functioning, yet it seems devoid of life. Cmdr Riker is leading an away team. Hopefully, the answer lies over there. Have you got a lock on that ship? Aye, sir. Can you put us on the bridge? Anywhere. I know the Yamato. Recommend the aft station of the bridge. When in doubt, surprise them. Them? Who's them? Whoever may be there. Our sensors show no life forms. Still, the tactic is sound. Agreed. Aft station. Aye, sir. Phasers on stun. Energise. This isn't the bridge. Worf? Halt! Don't fire! I heard you screaming. I was coming to help. You heard me? I heard you. Transporter Chief, where do you show us here? We show... Captain, do you read me? We're having difficulty with our communications. Number One, come in. Transporter room, we've lost contact with the away team. Beam them back. I've lost the lock on them. Nothing on my communicator, sir. Computer on. Let's find a turbo lift to the bridge. Transporter room, have you established a lock? Emergency power engaged. Initiate full check, all systems. Engineering section. What is our situation? Engineering? Request permission to leave the bridge. Granted. This isn't a Federation ship. These walls aren't tritanium. It's material beyond our technology. Let's get to the bridge. There must be an answer somewhere. This bridge should be four decks above us. What's going on here? That's not where we came from. Wait a minute... Two bridges? If we go through there, where will we be? On the bridge. But we are on the bridge. It's up to you, sir. Let's see what happens. Is it the same bridge? Or did we step from one bridge onto another bridge? We've regained communication, sir. I have a star fix. On screen. It's an opening, sir. Navigation is possible. Should I set a course? Transporter room, any fix on the away team? Negative, Captain. Damn! Commander. How did you...? Where did you come from? What's going on? A ship has one bridge. One bridge! One Riker, one bridge! Lieutenant! This is impossible! Impossible! Pull yourself together! At ease, Lieutenant. At ease. Captain, the star fix is fading. Data, lock on to the Yamato with a tractor beam. I cannot make the lock. The star fix is almost gone. Let it go. But, sir, we can get out. Let it go. Bridge, I have contact with the away team. Beam them back immediately. Captain. Come in, Enterprise. Hold position, away team. We're bringing you home. Transporter room, hurry! It's almost gone. What is going on? Are you alright? Let's put this technology to work and get the hell outta here! A ship that was almost the Yamato, in a hole in space, with no crew. What is the purpose? Plus, an attack by a non-existent Romulan vessel. It poses an interesting question. Was our away team actually there? If not, where were we? Commander. I have re-established the star fix. Great. Set course. Velocity, warp two. Course and speed set. Engage. I have lost contact, sir. What? The star fix is gone. Captain, it is not in the same sector, but another opening has appeared. Alright. Set a course for those stars, warp six. Yes, sir. Warp six. I have lost the signal, sir. What's going on? All stop. Captain. Yes, Mr. Data. I can see it. This game is wearing very thin. Let's just hold this position. Counsellor? You said you sensed no intelligence in all of this. You haven't changed in that belief? I'm not certain now, Captain. I do sense something unusual. Perhaps a different level of consciousness? Perhaps an intelligence so vast it eluded me. Rats in a maze. Exactly! Explain. Everything reminds me of a laboratory experiment. As if something was testing our responses to stimuli. Are you suggesting... that we're in some kind of laboratory? Yes. The opening seems closer, Captain. I've had enough of this. Agreed, Captain. Hold position. Good. Don't satisfy its curiosity. Captain, look! Why are you so alarmed? I've tried to look just like you. Captain, sensors show nothing out there. Absolutely nothing. Sure is a damn ugly nothing. I am Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise, representing a federation of planets in this part of the galaxy. Can you identify whoever or whatever you are? Nagilum. Speaks right up for something that isn't there, Data. We still have no idea what you represent. Data. Nagilum? You are of different construction than the others. Interesting. What are you? Your construction also differs. My... construction? Perhaps referring to your gender, Doctor. Yes, well, there are minor... differences. I'm what we call a female. I understand. The masculine and the feminine. It is the way we propagate our species. Please, demonstrate how this is accomplished. Not likely. Whatever you are, your actions are not welcome. Let me put up the shields, sir. Sensors still show nothing out there. Your life form surprises me more and more. Is it true you also have only a limited existence? Answer! What do you want? I don't understand the question. You exist and then you cease to exist. Your minds call it ""death"". How interesting. He's gone. We cannot allow you to do that! We will fight you. To understand death, I must amass information on every aspect of it. Every kind of dying. The experiment shouldn't take more than a third of your crew. Maybe half. Captain's log, stardate 42194. 7. It is obvious that whatever we have met sees no value in our life form. How do we fight something that both is, and is not, there? I know this much. We are unimportant to it. In a battle for survival, 30 to 50 percent casualties... Would be appalling. But within acceptable limits. This is not a battle, Worf. No. A laboratory experiment would be the closest comparison. Any reason not to believe Nagilum? No. Evidence indicates it is willing and able to do as it proposes. Agreed. Under the circumstances, there is only one decision. I will not stand by while half my crew is slaughtered. Sir, I cannot see anything you can do to prevent it. Yes, there is. What? Destroy the Enterprise. Isn't that like curing the disease by killing the patient? Better than standing around helplessly. Why do I get the feeling this was not the time to join this ship? Recognise Picard, Jean-Luc. Recognise Riker, William T. Initiate auto-destruct sequence. Does Riker, William T, concur? I do. Initiate auto-destruct sequence. Desired time interval? Stand by. Interesting question. How long to prepare to die? What would be the least painful for our crew? Move to it quickly, or allow them time to prepare thoroughly? Well, 20 minutes? Nice round figure. Initiate auto-destruct. Interval,... 20 minutes. 20 minutes to auto-destruct. 19 minutes, 50 seconds. Come. Our destroying ourselves won't change its mind. I would feel that. You didn't mention you were that certain. I was wrong not to tell you. And your decision may also be wrong. Yes. Come in, please. I have a question, sir. Yes, Data. What is it? What... is death? Is that all? Well, Data, you're asking probably the most difficult of all questions. Some see it as a changing into an indestructible form. Forever unchanging. They believe that the purpose of the entire universe is to then maintain that form in an Earth-like garden which will give delight through all eternity. On the other hand, there are those who hold to the idea of our blinking into nothingness,... ..with all our experiences, hopes and dreams merely a delusion. Which do you believe, sir? Considering the marvellous complexity of the universe, its clockwork perfection, its balances of this against that, matter, energy, gravitation, time, dimension, I believe that our existence must be more than either of these philosophies. That what we are goes beyond Euclidian or other practical measuring systems, and that our existence is part of a reality beyond what we understand now as reality. We should not let ourselves die, Jean-Luc. I agree with her, Jean-Luc. If only half of us live, I'd rather take my chances on being one that does. Yes. It is wrong of you to force us. It is wrong. Yes. This is very wrong. Neither of you should be reacting in this way. Computer, locate Cmdr Data for me. Cmdr Data is on the bridge. It's not going to work, Nagilum. Captain, we are clear. We are out of the void. It's gone, Captain. We can abort the auto-destruct. Hold, Number One. But, Captain... Hold. One minute to auto-destruct. We are out of the void. You may stop auto-destruct. Mr. Crusher, warp six, any heading. Now. 50 seconds to auto-destruct. 40 seconds to auto-destruct. Captain? It could all be part of the illusion. Cmdr Data, report. We are at warp six, on course. 30 seconds to auto-destruct. Counsellor Troi? It has gone. I no longer feel its presence. 20 seconds to auto-destruct. Ten seconds to auto-destruct. Captain. Abort auto-destruct sequence. Riker, William T, do you concur? Yes, I do concur, wholeheartedly! Auto-destruct cancelled. A simple ""yes"" would have sufficed. I didn't want there to be any chance of a misunderstanding. Of course. You have the bridge. He sure held that bluff to the last second, didn't he, sir? Was he bluffing? Well, Nagilum, I hope you got what you needed. You have provided me with much more than I needed. Why did you release us? You could have seen the way we face death. It wasn't necessary. I learned all I needed to know. Would you like me to share some conclusions? I'm not interested. Of course you are. You're too inquisitive for that. You seem to find no tranquillity in anything. You struggle against the inevitable. You thrive on conflict. You're selfish, yet you value loyalty. You are rash, quick to judge, slow to change. It's amazing you've survived. Be that as it may, as species, we have no common ground. You're too aggressive. Too hostile. Too militant. During this period, you too have been evaluated. It would seem we have at least one thing in common. Curiosity. The point is well taken, Captain. Perhaps that is a trait we share. And perhaps we shall meet again. But next time, it will be out here, among the stars. Ensign, put us back on course. Warp three. Yes, sir. Warp three. And, Ensign, if you encounter any holes, steer clear. "
S2E03,"Captain's log, stardate 42286.3. We have arrived on station at coordinates 3629 by 584, three days early for our rendezvous with the USS Victory. There is nothing to do now but hold this position and wait. Yes, Commander? Is there a problem? Chief Engineer La Forge called, ""urgent"". Of course. He's over there... with the Victory. Geordi, I just had a strange conversation with your assistant. Although it is three days until we rendezvous with the Victory... She believes it has already arrived? Not the starship, my friend. The original. This is my gift to the Victory's Captain Zimbata. Most unusual. I served with him. Sure wish he'd been in command of this Victory. Wind and sail, that's the proper way to move a ship. But your speciality is antimatter power, dilithium regulators. That's exactly why this fascinates me, Data. It's human nature to love what we don't have. Simpler days, huh? Anyway, stringing this rigging has made me dream of handling sails... This is not a computer simulation? The point in doing something like this is to make it by hand. Geordi,... your message said ""urgent"". So it is. While we're waiting, we have time for me to be Watson. More properly, your Watson. My Watson? I've shown you one of my dreams. Let's go and share in one of yours. That does seem only fair. Let no one touch this. Aye, sir. Where can I reach you? He can be reached at 221B Baker Street. Sir? Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilisations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Computer, select at random a mystery by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in which I will play Sherlock Holmes and Lt La Forge, Dr John Watson. Program complete. You may enter. Excellent. Look at all the detail. So you say everything in here has some significance? Holmes collected nothing, no trinkets, no thoughts which were not specifically significant to him. This? The emerald tie-pin. Presented to Holmes by Queen Victoria after he solved the theft of the Bruce-Partington Plans. Whitaker's Almanack, which gave Holmes the key to the secret code in The Valley of Fear. The snuffbox of Wilhelm Gottslieg Siegesmann Van der Romstein. Alright, Data. You solve the cases and get all the gifts. What do I do? Primarily as Dr Watson, you will keep a record of all I say and do. For later publication. And the famous Holmes violin, bought in a pawn shop in Tottenham Court Road for 55 shillings. Which he considered to be a very good investment. In the hands of some, the violin is a wondrous thing, equally capable of stirring the soul to the heights of bliss as to the depths of despair. But... Data, that's incredible. How can you play it like that? Merely throwing myself into the part, Watson. But... in the hands of my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the violin ceases to be a musical instrument at all and becomes... Watson, we are about to have guests. How could you...? Please answer that. Mustn't keep the Inspector waiting. Inspector? Who? Lestrade, of course. Holmes, are you there, man? Thank the Almighty you're available. I'm in a deuce of a dilemma. May I say your perturbation becomes you, Lestrade, and also affords me the opportunity to yet again serve Queen and country. Holmes really talked like that? Absolutely. We need your help, Holmes. This gentleman here, the emissary of a foreign government, has been the victim of a most accidentally wicked crime. Damn. Haven't they invented the electric light by now? What, dear fellow? Pray continue, Inspector. To put the matter simply, this man was accosted by gypsies intent on depriving him of his most valuable possessions. In the process of picking his pockets, they also bagged a photograph this man was carrying. Great Scott, the photograph! You will find that this emissary works not for, but against the King of Bohemia. That photograph of the King and his mistress is to be used for blackmail. Further, upon deeper reflection, you will deduce, as did l... Computer, freeze program. Exit. Geordi? Where are you going, Geordi? I'm done. But... I was about to reveal that the ""sir"" is in fact... What was the point in going to the holodeck? To solve a Holmes mystery. Exactly. But you've memorised them. Once anyone speaks, you've got it solved so there's no mystery. If there's no mystery, there's no game. No game, no fun. I'm not upset with you. It's just we arrange the time to go to the holodeck, get the wardrobe, then boom, before we get started you jump to the end. I was looking forward to the mystery. I should have extended the sequence of events. Oh, I'm not getting through. The fun in the program, Data, was in the attempt to solve a mystery. Is that not what we were doing? You're wasting your breath, Lieutenant. Saying that to Data is asking a computer not to compute. Am I so different from you, Doctor? Can you cease thinking on command? In medicine, I often face puzzles I do not know the answer to. She's right. You always know the answer. To feel the thrill of victory, there must be possible failure. Where's the victory if you can't possibly lose? Are you suggesting there is value in losing? Yes, that's the great teacher. We humans learn more often from a failure or a mistake than we do from an easy success. Not you. You learn by rote. All is memorisation and recitation. Deductive reasoning is also one of Data's strengths. Yes, and Holmes's, too. But Holmes understood the human soul, the dark flecks that drive us, that turn the innocent into the evil. That understanding is beyond Data. Now you're just being unfair, Doctor. I don't think so, Lieutenant. Your artificial friend hasn't a prayer of solving a Holmes mystery he hasn't read. I have read them all. See? Maybe the computer could create one where you wouldn't know the outcome. As I said, he hasn't a prayer. I accept your challenge, Doctor. Good for you. We shall return to the holodeck. I shall dare it to defeat me. And you, madam, are invited to be a witness. I wouldn't miss it. Come, Watson. There. I've instructed the computer to give us a Holmes-type problem, but not one written specifically by Conan Doyle. So this will be something new? Exactly. Will that be sufficient, Doctor? We'll see. Program complete. You may enter. Pies, pies. Some are meat and some are sweet. Very impressive. Your first visit to a holodeck? With this level of sophistication. How does it work? London was hundreds of square kilometres large. This is no larger than the holodeck, so the computer places images of more distant perspective on the walls. But you'd have to touch the wall to know it was there. And it fools you in other ways. I say, Holmes, where shall we head? The theatre? A concert perhaps? Stop him! Stop him! He stole my goods. No. It is a ruse. This way. What's here, Data? What are you doing? Tell us. The youth was a ploy. The real crime is here. The intended victim is that man, Mr. Jabez Wilson, employee of the Red-Headed League and dupe of some criminals. I saw this plaque, ""Home of the Red-Headed League"", and this rope on the bell. It enabled me to deduce that Mr. Wilson was headed here to meet a most distasteful and untimely demise. From this! Fraud. You didn't deduce anything. You just recognised elements from two different Holmes stories. Reasoning. From the general to the specific. Is that not the very definition of deduction, the way Holmes worked? Variations on a theme. Now do you see my point? All that he knows is in his memory banks. Inspiration, original thought, all the true strength of Holmes, is not possible for our friend. I'll give you credit for your vast knowledge, but your circuits would short out if you were confronted with a truly original mystery. It's elementary, dear Data. Wait a minute. We'll see whose circuits short out. Computer, arch. Are you sure you want to do this? Better wilted laurels than none at all. Computer, override previous program. OK. A program that definitely challenges Data. With events he has no previous knowledge of. Computer, in the Holmesian style, create a mystery to confound Data, with an opponent who has the ability to defeat him. Define parameters of program. What does that mean? How far to take the game. You mean limiting your risk? No, the parameters will be whatever is necessary to meet the directive. Create an adversary capable of defeating Data. What was that? Lieutenant? An odd surge of power, sir. It's gone now. Interesting. The same London, but... slightly different. Is something wrong, Professor? I... I feel like a new man. That dark fellow there used the word ""arch"", and then... I wonder... Arch. What have we here? Computer standing by. What are you? If you refer to the arch you ordered, it provides computer control. Do you wish to input any commands? Not at this time. It's dark magic, Moriarty! The best kind, I'm sure. But I need information. Data... I mean, Holmes, old boy, what are we looking for? For whatever finds us, Watson. She has been abducted. Who has? The good Doctor. I think she's hiding. She's gonna lead you on a wild-goose chase and then tell everyone. The Doctor has been carried away by two men. One is tall. The other is shorter, left-handed, and is employed in a laboratory. How do you know that? One set of footfalls is widely spaced. The other is evenly spaced, closer together. Further, on the ground you can see the scrapes made by his left shoe as he twists behind, presumably to see if he is being followed. Left-footed means left-handed. The dark colourings of the scrapes are the leavings of natural rubber, a type of non-conductive sole used by researchers experimenting with electricity. Finally, there can be no argument. The game... is afoot. Come, Watson. Hear that? What do those footfalls tell you, Watson? We're on the right track. More particularly, that our opposition does consist of two men. And that one of them is carrying the bound and gagged Dr Pulaski. You know this because you read it in a Holmes story, right? Not at all. We do not hear her steps, so the Doctor is probably being carried. We do not hear cries for help, so she must be gagged. Further, both sets of footfalls are heavy and masculine. One man shuffles and stumbles in an irregular pattern. Since the ground is level, we must conclude that Dr Pulaski is struggling with her captor, sporadically knocking him off stride. Deduction. Pure and simple. Well, not that simple. Footfalls! There they are again, Watson. I dare say we have caught up nicely with our quarry. There should be a doorway. Yeah, come on. Holmes! Thank God you're here. Make way, please. Make way for Sherlock Holmes. It's murder, Holmes. Murder most foul. Well, Holmes, what do you say, man? I do not see how this connects with the doctor's disappearance. Doctor? Dr Watson is right here. Dr Pulaski. But do not be concerned. You have enough on your mind. She was with you? If I may be of assistance. As I take note of this... dead man, I deduce that he was strangled. The finger marks on his throat show this. There are signs of struggle, so the murderer was a stranger who attacked him from behind. Is that correct, Holmes? No. Look at his shoes. He's a convict released today from Dartmoor prison. He spent the day in a tavern, consuming large amounts of gin, with his killer, who followed him to this very spot and waited over there until the victim slipped into a drunken stupor. Then, out of fear, motivated only by self-protection, strangled him. There is your killer, Inspector. Seize her! When you check, I believe you will find that this poor soul is the victim's common-law wife, who has been dreading the release of this vile man. She hardly has the strength to strangle a man this size. Not with her hands, no. But with this... ! When used as a garrotte, these beads make a mark similar to fingerprints. And, Watson, you will note on the victim's throat, the marks are too evenly spaced to have been made by human hands. Astounding, Holmes. Not really, Inspector. And now, for strictly personal reasons, I must leave. Come, Watson. This murder does not connect with our case. Come along. Hurry it up. Come on. Data, wait. If this murder is unconnected to Dr Pulaski, then the computer is running an independent program. Yes. Why? I do not know. That is what puzzles me. So you don't know what'll happen? No. Excellent. Where to now? We will find Dr Pulaski in here. How's that? It is obvious. Why is that correct? Isn't this a game of misdirection? Not now. He wants us to find him. Who does? The master criminal, the man Holmes could only defeat at the cost of his own life at Reichenbach Falls. Our adversary, my dear Watson, is none other than Professor Moriarty himself. Now this is getting interesting. There's nothing here but barrels. And a trail, which is so well marked, that obviously we are meant to follow it. No, Data. It's another dead end. No, Watson, it's not a dead end at all. Hello. What's this? Can you see the scratches? The Doctor was right. Finally we have a game worth playing. The time for games is over. Professor Moriarty, I presume. How do you know? He's the one worthy opponent created by Conan Doyle. And like a spider, I feel vibrations when anyone new chances into my web. Welcome, my dear Holmes. But not Holmes. And Dr Watson. But not Watson. How does he know we're not who we appear to be? Where is Dr Pulaski? She's here. She will have said nothing. She has provided many answers. Do you forget I am your equal? I have read her expressions. What she has not said is as important as her words. Have you injured her? I will, if necessary. But my mind is crowded with images, thoughts I do not understand, yet cannot purge. They plague me. You and your associate look and act so oddly. Yet though I have not seen the like of you, I am familiar with you both. Very confusing. I have felt new realities at the edge of my consciousness readying to break through. Surely, Holmes, if that's who you are, you of all people appreciate what I mean. Say nothing. I know that there is a great power called Computer, wiser than the oracle at Delphi, a power which controls all of this, and to which we can speak. Arch. Data, this isn't right. A hologram shouldn't be able to call the arch. It has described a monstrous shape on which I am like a fly stuck on a turtle's back, adrift in emptiness. What is this, Holmes? Data, wait. Why does it frighten you, Holmes? Data. Will you please tell me what's going on? Computer, exit! Computer, execute complete shutdown of the holodeck. Access denied. Explain. Override protocol has been initiated. The program didn't shut down. We must see the Captain. Wait. What's on that paper? Why can't we shut down the holodeck? This. This is impossible. How can a character from 1890s London draw the Enterprise? Who's got control of the computer? He does. Moriarty. Impossible. I don't understand. Nor do l. What about the Doctor? Is she alright in there? No. She is in grave danger. Computer, why wasn't the holodeck program terminated? The override protocol has been initiated. On whose authority? Lt Geordi La Forge. Me? Alright, tell me from the beginning exactly what happened. Dr Pulaski and I had a discussion about whether Data could solve an original mystery. Which the computer provided? Yes, with a worthy opponent. Worthy of Holmes? My God. I asked... for a Holmes-type mystery with an opponent capable of defeating Data. That's got to be it. Merde. Captain, I'm sorry. I understand, Lieutenant. Captain, this character, Moriarty, he called for the arch. He did what? So... he has access to the computer. And perhaps our library files as well. That information would be necessary to create a true adversary for me. Theorise, Data. What are his limits? He is still a fictional character, originally programmed with 19th-century knowledge. Which now has access to 24th-century knowledge. What does he need to use it? Only time. Sir, I can lead a security team to sweep the holodeck, and bring the Doctor out. I believe that would place the Doctor at risk. Our mortality fail-safe has probably been overridden. Computer, where is Dr Pulaski? Dr Pulaski is on holodeck two. And her vital signs? Strong and stable. Captain, recommend we attempt to destroy the hologram generations themselves. Is that possible, Geordi? I could split a particle beam out of the matter/antimatter chamber and ride it into the holodeck. If accelerated sufficiently, that would wash away all present holographic constructs. The London buildings, streets, people, all gone, including Moriarty. Dr Pulaski? The beam will tear apart human flesh as well. Captain, I'm sensing something from the holodeck. It's as if a unifying force or single consciousness is trying to bring it all into focus. There can be only one explanation. In programming Moriarty to defeat me, not Holmes, he had to acquire something which I possess. What, exactly? Consciousness, sir. Without it he could not defeat me. Computer, what happened? Altitude and stabilisation control of the Enterprise was momentarily transferred to holodeck two. Data, you and I should return to the holodeck. I will change into my uniform. No. I will change into a costume. Uniforms might pose questions I don't want asked. It seems that he feeds on knowledge. Well, let's not give your nemesis any more information than we have to. How did you make the room shake? I'm not sure. Now, dear lady,... will that be one lump or two? Lumps, Professor? What sort of lumps? Milk, of course? Why not? Mr. Computer proposes the incredible thought that we are all travelling in a vessel of some sort. Is that true? I don't know what you're talking about. The scones are likewise a must. This is... really quite excellent. Strange, it actually pleases me to hear you say that. Very strange. You're sounding very different from the Moriarty I've read about. You're not frightened of me? No. You should be. Mr. Computer, the arch, please. A few more questions, Mr. Computer. I just can't seem to remember that last command. Oh, well, sooner or later it'll all come to me. But in the meantime, I will approach the problem from a familiar perspective. There's no reason why I can't use knowledge from my world to bring me closer to yours. I have no idea what you mean. Of course you do. The more you proclaim ignorance, the more I am on to you. Your every silence speaks volumes. If you know what I'm saying when I'm not saying anything, what do you need me for? Thank you for the tea and crumpets. I guess I'll be going. Where? Back to here? Yes. Would you care to join me? In time. In time I will leave all of this and join you out there. Or is this where we both are right now? Right now, we are in London. Tell me what you want from me, or allow me to leave. I want nothing more than what the fisherman expects of the worm. You, dear Doctor, will be the lure. And this will be the hook for your Capt Jean-Luc Picard. Who is that? How well you know. Nice suit. Thank you. Captain, I will be standing by to assist you. You'll be a big hit in London. Computer, is the program still running? Affirmative. You may enter. Data, shall we go? Gentlemen. Open. We don't have much time. He's getting more control. Let's try to beat Moriarty by giving him everything he wants. Obviously he's trying to alter the programming. Captain? Tuppence. Two pence. Supposed to be good luck. We may need some. I'll take that coin, sir. That's right, and any more you got. Excuse me. I don't think so. I want money. That's right, I want it now. Data. This hologram differs from any I've seen. Could he injure you? It's more serious than that. The mortality fail-safe has been circumvented. He could've killed me. Let it go, guv. He's hurtin' me. Data, let him go. We will find Moriarty this way, sir. The warehouse. You alright? Yes, except for being crammed full of crumpets. I'm a civilised abductor, Captain. Civilised, but still dangerous. Bridge to holodeck control. Worf. Here, sir. Status? Anything changed? No, sir. Moriarty, you were... conjured up in an attempt to defeat Holmes here. Once that attempt is concluded, your program has run its course. Your existence is done. Congratulations, Professor. I capitulate to the better man. Your victory, sir, is... is well earned. It's gone beyond that game, Mr. Data. Note I no longer call you Holmes. Whatever I was when this began, I have grown. I am understanding more and more. I am able to use the power at my fingertips. I can affect this vessel. And I can inflict bodily harm on you, and on your Doctor. Yes, you can do that, but you haven't. You shook this ship to get my attention. What is it you want? The same thing you want for yourself, to continue to exist. If I destroy this vessel, can you say that it doesn't matter to you? Interesting pun, don't you think? For matter is what I am not. The computer says I am made up only of energy. That may not be entirely... true,... Professor. This which we call the holodeck, uses a principle similar to a device called a transporter. In the time we live, humans have discovered that energy and matter are interchangeable. In the holodeck, energy is converted into matter. Thus you have substance. But only here. And if I step off this holodeck? Then, Professor, you will cease to exist. You are not alive. As I said before, you are only... A holographic image. I know. But are you sure? Yes. Does he have life? He's a machine, but is that all he is? No. He is more. Exactly. Is the definition of life cogito, ergo sum, I think, therefore I am? Yes, that is one possible definition. It is the most important one. And for me, the only one that matters. You asked your computer to program a nefarious fictional character from 19th-century London, which is how I arrived. But I am no longer that creation, that evil character. I have changed. I am alive. And I am aware of my own consciousness. Moriarty, my responsibility is this vessel and its crew. I want my existence. I want it out there, just as you have yours. That may not be possible. Then you must murder me, Captain. I cannot give you what you want. Because you cannot convert holodeck matter into a more permanent form. Yes, that is so. A pity. What I have seen,... ..what I have learned,... ..fascinates me. I do not want to die. And I do not want to kill you. Madam, I have enjoyed your company. Computer,... arch. Cancel override protocol. Return control of the holodeck to main computer. My fate is in your hands. As perhaps it always was. Bridge, this is the Captain. Cmdr Riker here, sir. Number One, the situation is under control. Aye, sir. Moriarty, this vessel's computer has a vast memory capacity. I know. You won't be extinguished. We will save this program. Hopefully, in time, when we know enough, we will bring you back, able to leave the holodeck. Perhaps we'll meet again, madam. It could be a while. Time won't pass for you, but I may be an old woman. But I'll still fill you with crumpet, madam. I detest long goodbyes. You have the arch. As you wish. A short goodbye. Computer, save the program of the character Moriarty, then discontinue. Damaged? Yes, sir. She cracked a spar when the Enterprise was shaken. Otherwise, she weathered it quite nicely. She's beautiful. A wonderful testimony to simpler times. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. It's just that, I can't help thinking how... What else might have happened because I misspoke a single word? Soon she'll be ship-shape and Bristol fashion. ""Bristol fashion"", sir? It's an old navy phrase, meaning everything in perfect order. Yes, sir. As are we, Mr. La Forge. Yes, sir. Captain, Starship Victory has arrived. On my way, Number One. "
S2E04,"Captain's log, stardate 42402.7. We're in the Omega Sagitta system traversing between the twin planets that form the Coalition of Madena. Both worlds are populated by a humanoid race which colonised the planets two centuries ago. They coexist under a precarious but successful treaty. Unidentified vessel approaching. Sensors show a small, class-9 vessel, probably an interplanetary cargo ship. One life sign aboard, sir. It appears to be humanoid. I have its call sign now. Confirmed. Armed with lasers only. Its cargo holds are empty. Its guidance system is malfunctioning. The pilot is attempting to hold course manually. We should set the Enterprise to intercept in case he needs help. Make it so, Mr. Crusher. We're in position now, Captain. Open hailing frequencies. Frequencies open. On viewer. This is the USS Enterprise, Capt Jean-Luc Picard. This is the cargo carrier Erstwhile. Captain Okona at your service, sir. No need for phasers. I'm harmless and not ready for a mercy killing. You were never considered a danger. That's a shame. I remember when I was at least considered a risk. I'm owner of this craft. Since you've already scanned it, you know I'm alone and empty, which is a rare occasion for a man of my charm and talent. Mute main viewer. Counsellor? His emotions suggest he is mischievous, irreverent and somewhat brazen. The word that seems to best describe him is ""rogue"". ""Rogue""? Cad, knave, rake, rascal, villain, wild element... Yes, Data, but there is no malevolence or ill will. Audio on. You have a burnout in your guidance system. If you can diagnose my problems, why not help fix them? Captain, we can easily repair the system he uses. We can accommodate you. First Officer here. If you shut down your engines, we can beam you over. Sir, recommend limited access to our ship. Agreed. Data, lock on him. Prepare to beam him aboard. Ready on your command. Excuse me, Commander, is that a woman's voice I hear? Yes. Follow Cmdr Riker's instructions so we can get back to our routine. Whatever you say, Captain. Something funny? Well, the unexpected is our normal routine. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilisations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Hold it steady, Wesley. Ready to link on my command. Aye, sir. Easy. Engage. Captain, shut down your engines. Understood. Transporter room, prepare for beaming. Wesley, Data, let's go. Your weapons, please. A Klingon security officer? Yes. No wars available? It's more a piece of jewellery than a weapon. A remembrance. Welcome aboard. I'm Cmdr Riker. If you turn over the part, we'll begin repairs. I'd be happy to do the work. I'm a hands-on type. You'd find our tools rather unusual. I can believe that. May I at least watch? That can be arranged. Good, then, Commander, I leave this in your capable hands. Sir, this is Cmdr Data. I'm just an acting ensign. Acting ensigns have names, don't they? Wesley. Wesley Crusher. Nice to meet you, Wesley Wesley Crusher. And thank you for beaming me here and enabling me to see a truly beautiful woman. You have a majestic carriage and loveliness that surely traces back to the noblest families. I'm sure you've said that to many, and it was not true then either. But it's how I say it that's really important. The warmth, the attraction that I have for you. The attraction that we share. Mr. Okona appears to have excellent vision as well as a healthy libido. It's 806. Capt Okona, if you follow Cmdr Data, you can start right away. Now, that's sex appeal. Sexual attraction in this context is not part of my programming. I am an android. Well, have you seen any good-looking computers lately? That's a joke. It's funny. Of course it is. That'll do what the original did? It sure will. And better. Let me show you. On your old one, the zelebium contacts wore down. What I've done is replace them with tricellite. Tricellite isn't available here. If I had to replace them... No need. Your ship will never outlast this part. Because of the part, or the way I fly? This part, but you do tend to push your ship beyond its capabilities. Blame the pattern of my life, Lieutenant. It relegates me to cargo carrying, rather than your grand explorations, so I am forced to add some flamboyancy and zest to the doldrums of my existence. Have you ever been cold? No. Warm, then? No. What about drunk? Ever do that? That is not possible for me. Pity. What about love? The act or the emotion? They're both the same. I believe that statement to be inaccurate, sir. Maybe. Life is like loading twice your cargo weight onto your spacecraft. If it's canaries and you keep half of them flying all the time,... ..you're alright. I doubt that statement is accurate either. Accurate? That was a joke I just told. I do not understand. You don't know what a joke is? Of course. It is a witticism, a gag, a bon mot, words concluding with a trick ending. That's the dictionary meaning. I mean humour, fun. D'you know what funny is? Where is 806? Right over there, sir. Why? You probably wouldn't understand that either. Hello, there. Status on the repair? Working on it. Commander, what do you think of Capt Okona? Well, Okona is an interesting man. We've seen how he handles his ship. Apparently he can handle people as well. Then why does he work alone? He lives by his own rules. He does what he does by his choice. Someday, you'll make yours. I already have. You agree with Okona that I am missing an important human factor? I never said that. I simply said that I've never seen you laugh. I am capable of that function when it is expected of me. Data, do you even know what a joke is? Of course. It is a witticism, a gag, a bon mot, a... Stop. Look, it's just you and I here. We're having an intimate conversation. Why? Because you're a 'droid and I'm a 'noid. Why? Because that's what I am. Have I offended you? No. Then why are you annoyed? Because you're a 'droid and I'm a 'noid. Humanoid. Yes. You told a joke. Yes. I am not laughing. Yes. Perhaps the joke was not funny. No, it was funny. It's you. Are you sure? Yes. I agree. What do I do? Under normal circumstances, I'd say seek a higher power. In your case, probably a smarter computer is in order. Computer, I wish to know more about humour, why certain combinations of words and actions make humans laugh. Source material is extensive. Please specify. Animated presentation, humanoid. Interaction required. Physical humour, cerebral, or general raconteur? Of all performers available, who's considered funniest? 23rd-century Stan Orega specialised in jokes about quantum mathematics. No. Too esoteric. More generic. Accessing. That one. RW96321, 20th century. Program complete. You may enter. Thanks, ladies and gentlemen, you've been great. I'd like to take you home. But I took the last audience home and there's no more room. But thank you. And thank you for bringing me here. What's up? Mr. Comic, I wish to know what is funny. Funny? I don't know. It's a matter of opinion. Tip O'Neill in a dress? Some people say words that end with a K are funny. A briefcase that looks like a fish. That's hysterical. Tip O'Neill... Accessing. 20th-century male, politician, overweight, wearing female clothing, carrying a valise that looks like a fish. So the juxtaposition of gender and an amphibian briefcase is funny. Well, I think whatever makes you laugh is funny. Nothing does. I wish to learn. How much time do we have here? Unlimited. We're gonna need it. You are a tough room. ""Tough room""? A colloquialism meaning a severe, rigid, closed-minded audience. I understand. I will attempt to be an easy room. Show me what is funny. Alright, you're on. Jerry Lewis. Mr. Robot, come up. I'm an android. I'm sorry. Mr. Android. Here, teeth. Put 'em in your mouth. Where'd he go? Where did...? Mr. An... Here. Here, try, if you would. You do... No. You go... That is considered... That is considered to be funny? Brought the house down in Teaneck. A word ending in K. So if you put funny teeth in your mouth and jump around like an idiot, that is considered funny. I didn't get your name. Data. Data, did you consider juggling, weird bird calls, stuff like that? That does not apply. I simply want to know what is funny. I want to involve myself in other people's laughter. I wish to join in. I think that's nice. Let's put the physical stuff aside. We'll do jokes. It's not my forte, but it might work for you. If you would have a seat, and we'll try some jokes. We'll start with the classics. A salesman is driving along. His car breaks down. Access faster. Faster. Move to maximum speed. A guy goes to his doctor. The doctor says, ""You need an operation."" The guy wants a second opinion. The doctor says, ""OK, you're ugly too."" Was that funny? No. Data, you spoiled the joke. It could have been your timing. My timing is digital. What? That's funny. Why? It would take too long to explain. Another joke? A monk, a clone and a Ferengi go bowling... Cmdr Data, report to the main bridge. I will be back. Bring new jokes. An unidentified at 12, mark four. No response to our inquiries. Extend hailing frequencies, all languages. Extending. It is an interplanetary vessel. Class-7. Crew complement 26. Still no response. Captain, they are now locking lasers on us. Lasers? Yes. Lasers can't even penetrate our navigation shields. Don't they know? Regulations do call for yellow alert. Very old regulation. Well, make it so, Number One, and reduce speed. Drop main shields, too. May I ask why? In case we surrender to them. Still no response to our hail. It is slowing and holding its position, Captain. Sir, we are now being hailed. Viewer on. Federation vessel, you have no rights in this solar system. I am Debin of Atlec, ordering you to heave to and prepare to be boarded. Shades of Gulliver's Travels. He actually meant it. But he is right. We are in their solar system. Open a channel. Open, sir. I am Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise. Why have you locked weapons on us? You are towing the spacecraft of a known criminal. He needed emergency repairs. It was our obligation to assist. You have a man aboard by the name of Okona. I want him. On what authority? He is guilty of crimes committed on Atlec. I expect him to be turned over to my authority immediately. Mute. What do you think, Counsellor? He believes what he's saying. His anger is genuine. Open. What crimes are they? Neither important nor necessary. I want Okona now! Another class-7 armed spacecraft is approaching from the opposite sector. Another ship from Atlec? Similar in specifications and capabilities, but a variation in markings and hailing language. Debin, hold this position. Viewer off. Data, identify. Sensors indicate a security vessel from the planet Straleb. Another glob fly. Glob fly? A Klingon fly, half as big as an Earth mosquito with no sting, and a buzzing sound like this... Viewer on. Hailing frequencies. Open, sir. I am Secretary Kushell, from the Legation of Unity of Straleb. I am Capt Jean-Luc Picard. We know who you are. We've been monitoring your communications. And we know of the demands made by Debin of Atlec. Then you know we have no hostile intention. You only have to concede to one demand. That word ""demand"" has a tone of finality. It is a word I have chosen. We demand that you turn Okona over to us immediately. Mute. Mr. Okona to the bridge immediately. Open. The same demand has been made by the Atlecs. I have no interest in their request. But we intend to back up our rights to Okona. I would rather not escalate the situation any further. Our honour and prestige are at stake. We are ready to take Okona by force and die in the doing of it. I trust that that can be avoided. I will respond to your request shortly. Viewer off. Capt Okona has not responded. He's been reported in three different crew quarters. Find him. Get him up here. Yes, sir. Come with me to the main bridge. I'm sure it can wait a few minutes. Now! I'd like that. But I have my orders. Some other time. Remember what it took to drag me from you. Am I going to meet Capt Picard? Definitely. Did I say something funny? Capt Picard, this is Thadium Okona. Mr. Okona, you were welcomed aboard without undue investigation. It was assumed that you did not come under false pretences. But it seems that you may have done. If you mean my socialising with the members of the crew... Mr. Okona, you are free to socialise with the members of my crew. I'm talking about a man named Debin. From Atlec. I know some of his family. Perhaps you can explain why he is threatening to attack us unless I give him custody of you. I can't. Then tell me why Kushell of Straleb is demanding the same thing. He's here also? And quite adamant. Mr. Okona, what crimes are you accused of? I am not a criminal. Why do these men want you? I can't say. They're threatening to attack. That's mad. They'd have no chance. Right. So you can offer no reason why they are set on this provocative course? I can't think of one right now. On viewer. Which ship? What? The first one. Capt Debin. Captain, let me ask you again, what are Okona's crimes? That is not your concern. It is if you wish him released. Alright. You want to know what he did, why I have chased him across this system? This is his crime. He dishonoured my daughter. He took advantage of her, then left her carrying his bastard child. He'll return and do the right thing, or I'll hunt him through the galaxy. Captain's log, supplemental. Some of the mystery surrounding this ancient morality play has been revealed. One of Capt Okona's pursuers is an outraged father with a heartfelt, if arcane, sense of righteousness. Your advice, Counsellor. We are dealing with ancient codes involving procreation. They are meaningless to us, but to Debin they represent honour. He will fight, risking himself, his crew, his daughter and her unborn child. Your Counsellor's right. He will fight. The other Captain is demanding to be heard. I don't suppose you have any idea why this man wants you? Let's put all this together. Lt Worf, multiple image, full conference mode. Let them all see each other. Yes, sir. Here you are, Debin, trying to save this criminal. My purpose is not your concern. It is if it involves Okona. Gentlemen, please, let's try and resolve this matter. Capt Kushell, what crime has Okona allegedly committed? He is a thief. He stole the Jewel of Thesia, a national heritage. A thing. An item. My case involves the victimisation of my daughter, and my honour. I'll have Okona now. He is mine! One at a time. Who accuses me of stealing? My son Benzan and I. Father, please. He used you to become my friend. He used my daughter. He used my son to plunder a national treasure. Mute. Terminate communications. Come with me. Captain, you can't be afraid of them. No. They couldn't hurt the Enterprise. My predicament is you. I'm sorry my ship broke down. I'm sorry you're involved. But you're right. Whatever happens, someone gets hurt. If I go to Kushell, Debin fights. If you go to Debin, the same. I wish I could... I wish I could make it easier. I'm sure you do. I won't apologise for the way I am or how I live my life. But I did not steal the Jewel of Thesia. I am not a criminal, Captain. As to the other business, that's between me and Yanar, no one else. In truth, I do not have authority in this matter. I am not your judge, nor is it my duty to arbitrate. But you are in my custody, which creates a dilemma. How about this? Do what you said, fix my guidance system and let me go. According to regulations, that is what I should do. But their ships are faster than yours. I'm doing you no favour. Captain, with all due respect, that's not your concern. Besides, I can take care of myself. You're quite a craftsman, Lt La Forge. How soon? What's the rush? I thought you liked it here. I did. It stopped liking me. Time to disappear. Where will you go? What? I said, where will you go? A new place, if I make it. Don't you ever stay anywhere? Not for long. I couldn't be like that. I mean, always being alone. Cmdr Riker says you choose to live this way. Is that what he said? Yeah. It would be difficult for me to be leaving all the time. I'd miss my friends, the people I love. I guess leaving's gotten easy for you. I seem to use up a place. I wasn't talking about a place. I know what you were talking about. It's ready. You should be able to install it in five minutes. Like you said, Geordi, what's the rush? I have some friends around here. I think it's time to make a stand. Mr. Okona. Captain, I've decided not to leave. But I'm not staying either. What are your plans? I've decided to surrender myself. To which one? There's really only one option. Viewer on. Gentlemen, communicating like this is very distracting. I suggest we beam you up, and we resolve this face to face. Excellent. Agreed. Leave your weapons behind. Keep this civilised. Number One, take the bridge. Counsellor, accompany me to deck 14 conference room. Worf, see to our guests. Aye, sir. They have no weapons. This way. Okona, you are without shame. For once, I agree with Debin. You are without shame. I trusted you. My son treated you like a brother. And then to steal from us. I want him now. No, he's coming with me. My complaint was registered first. Now, please, be calm. Lieutenant, thank you. Everyone is talking about me, not to me. You all believe that I stole the jewel. And that I fathered the child. You dare call my daughter a liar. Now I'm offered these two choices, and given these two options,... ..condemnation as a thief, or marriage to the beautiful Yanar. I will take the more pleasant sentence. I will take Yanar as my wife. No, you can't. You can't escape that way. I don't mean that. It's not up to you, nor to Okona. I've been dishonoured. I will decide. Wait. Since all of you believe Okona is the father, then so be it. I'll marry you. No, you can't. Yes, I can. Okona is still a thief. No, he's not. Nothing has been stolen. The jewel has been taken into custody by its rightful heir. Me. I was to give it to Yanar as our pledge of marriage. Marriage? Yanar is carrying my child. You said it was Okona's. If I'd told you it was Benzan, you would have gone to war with his father. I let you think it was Okona. See how I get a reputation? If I had said I was giving the jewel to Yanar, you'd have disowned me. Now we're hearing truth. So you let me chase Okona when you knew he was innocent? Yes. I didn't think for one moment that you could catch him. He never would have. Once Yanar accepted the jewel the marriage would have been made. Well, I never got it. Then Okona does have the jewel. I never had the chance to deliver it. Anyway, it's too late. I won't marry Benzan. Then you'll marry Okona. I won't marry anyone! I have reinstated the same program. With some new jokes, I hope. Program complete. Enter when ready. Comic, continue. More freebies? No cover, no minimum, just ""Comic, continue""? What happened, Data? I told a joke. And? No one laughed. Nobody in the whole room? I was the whole room. She said I spoiled the joke. ""Killed"" is a better word. You should always try out new material on an audience. He could be right. Perhaps that's what you need. Computer, program an audience appropriate to this venue. Yanar. You're angry at the embarrassment of all this. Maybe the timing is not the most romantic, but... I know you love Benzan. I don't want to see you throw that away just because your parents have been quarrelling for years and don't know how to behave properly. I've carried your messages for almost six months, smuggled you to see each other. You feel for him the same way he feels for you. I do love you. It is your child. Our child. Marry me. Yes. We'll find a new planet to live on. You'll live on Straleb. No. You'll live on Atlec. I will not have this man raising my grandson. The rest of this is to be settled between yourselves. Excuse us. We have business. Thank you, Captain. Your grandson? My grandson. Thank you. Thanks for coming, folks. We got a great show for you tonight. I'm so excited. Tonight I have the funny man of the stars, the android of antics, that lieutenant commander of mirth. Please give him a nice welcome, none other than... He's just the best... Data! Evening, ladies and germs. I come from a town so small, we had a fraction for a zip code. You made a living doing this? Yes. It was so small, we didn't have a godfather of crime, we had a nephew. I was so ugly, they hung a pork chop around my neck... ..so the dog would play with me. Then there was the human cannonball, who was hired and fired in the same night. Audience program off. Discontinue comic. It was a holodeck audience, programmed to laugh at everything. I could reprogram the audience to display a more accurate response. Data, let me give you one. Being able to make people laugh, or being able to laugh, is not the be-all of being human. No. But there is nothing more... uniquely human. Hold your speed, Capt Okona. Disengage. Separated. I'm under my own power now. Thank you. Thank you, Capt Picard. Goodbye, Capt Okona. Bye, Capt Okona. Say goodbye, Data. Goodbye, Data. Was that funny? Accessing. Burns and Allen, Roxy Theater, New York City, 1932. It still works. Heard about the girl in the nudist colony that nothing looked good on? We're ready to leave, sir. Take my Worf. Please. Warp speed, sir? Please. "
S2E05,"Captain's log, stardate 42477.2. The Enterprise has been diverted to the Ramatis star system. Both sides of a bitter planetary conflict have petitioned Starfleet to transport to their world a mediator they have mutually selected. Our orders are transportation only. No interference. Reduce to half impulse. Reducing velocity to one half impulse. Come. Number One. Look at this. Since we left Lima Sierra, I've wondered how the third planet could maintain an orbit that is theoretically impossible. But consider this... No degeneration. Exactly. Why? Why? I haven't a clue. Perhaps this facsimile lacks the proper mass. Perhaps, but if this is an accurate representation, it could explain what happened there. Perhaps. Well, it's not a matter of any great moment, just a knot I had to untie. What do you want? We've arrived at Ramatis III. Oh, well. Time to leave. Standard orbit, Mr Crusher. Mr Data, you have the bridge. Transporter room five. I'm still uncomfortable with you leading this away team. This is not an away team, Commander. I consider it a ceremonial function. For me not to go could be construed as lack of interest. You will be careful, sir? Cluck, cluck, Number One. Sir? You're being a mother hen. I appreciate your concern. Actually, I look forward to meeting this mediator. We came a long way. They wanted the best. That, according to all reports, is Riva. If he can put an end to all the years of blood-letting, we must do everything to help him. Our job isn't to police the galaxy. Isn't that my speech? But you're right. We must not get involved. Coordinates input, sir. Have your sensors indicated any problem down there? None. But you're feeling a certain confusion about this mission. No. Yes. I've never known you to have such strong emotions, except when you expect battle. I am not expecting battle. Then what is bothering you? Riva negotiated many treaties between the Klingons and the Federation. Before him, there was no Klingon word for ""peacemaker"". I see why you feel uneasy. Now, look, this is a simple ceremonial greeting, nothing more. Alright? Aye, sir. Energize. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain, this is the Enterprise. We've arrived safely, Number One, but so far we've been ignored. I'll keep you informed. I would appreciate it. Please, come closer. Before I start, is there anything you need? Food, refreshments? Thank you, no. Then, proceed. Greetings from the United Federation of Planets. I am Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise. This is Counsellor Troi. Lt Worf. Greetings. Welcome to Ramatis. I have been expecting you. You are empathic? Yes. Then you know my feelings towards you. Let me put them into words. I am looking forward to this journey now more than ever because it gives me a chance to be in your company. I am flattered. I too am looking forward to learning more about you. There are aspects to Riva we are ignorant of. Precisely. Our way of communicating has developed over the centuries, and it's one that I find quite harmonious. Then, Riva the mediator... Is deaf. Deaf? Born and hope to die. And you three speak for him? Yes. We serve as translators. We convey his thoughts and emotional intent. I am the scholar. I represent the intellect, and speak in matters of judgement, philosophy, logic. Also, I am the dreamer, the part that longs to see beauty beyond the truth, which is the first duty of art. I am the poet who... Artists, they tend to ramble, neglect the moment. I am passion, the libido, I am the anarchy of lust, the romantic, and the lover. I am also the warrior, the perfect line which never wavers. I am that which binds all the others together. I am harmony, wisdom, balance. Remarkable. And so these... Speak to me! What? Speak directly to me. Your unique presentation provoked this inadvertent breach in protocol. No insult was intended. Then none is perceived. I'm curious how this rare form of communication came about. The hearing gene is not present in my planet's ruling line. Not that unusual. It is similar to the house of Hanover on your Earth, who all had haemophilia. Or to the leaders of Fendaus V, who had no limbs. Many of our galaxy's greatest contributors have been special. My chorus is so attuned, they hear my thoughts and translate to you. It is a relationship that goes back centuries. Their ancestors provided the same service to my ancestors. Your method of communication is elegant and quite beautiful. It takes a fine mind to realise that, Counsellor Troi. This part of you doesn't speak very often. Only when the spirit moves me. Riva, if you're ready, the situation on Solais V is critical. Very well. With your permission, Captain. Make it so. Enterprise, this is the away team. Seven to beam up. Cmdr Riker, they're on board. Acknowledged. Ensign, set your course for Solais V. Course is set. Velocity, warp eight. Warp eight, aye. Engage, Ensign. What is this? Riva is deaf. These three speak for him. Treat them as interpreters. Address yourselves directly to Riva. May I present my First Officer? First, Captain, may I say it is an honour to be on board such a fine vessel. Now, please, continue with the introductions. My First Officer, Cmdr Riker. It is an honour to meet you. It is a pleasure to meet such a... unique individual. Thank you. It is my pleasure to meet you, sir. What is that you're wearing? A visor. It interprets the electromagnetic spectrum and carries readings to my brain. Without it, can you see? No, I'm as blind as a stump. Then your visor serves the same function as my chorus, which interprets my thoughts and translates them into sound? Yes. And you don't resent it? The visor or being blind? Either. No, they're part of me and I like who I am, so I have no reason to resent either. What is your position on the ship? I am the Chief Engineer, sir. It's a blessing to understand that we are special, each in his own way. Yes, that's the way I feel exactly. I offer the hospitality of my vessel. At your convenience, there is a briefing on the Solari wars. I'll have you conducted to your quarters. Thank you. Perhaps, if it is not inconvenient, Counsellor Troi could escort me, with your permission. This way. What about you? At times like this, we become an encumbrance. So, if you have rooms for us...? Lt Worf will escort you. Riva's not what I expected. Much of what we do is similar. Yes, in a way it is. We have learnt how to allow people to examine feelings hidden deep within their psyche. In fact, being with you here now is provoking an emotional revelation. You mean some emotion buried deep within your psyche? Well, not that deep. Exactly what are you feeling? Can't you tell? Some of it. Well, I feel that soon, perhaps after your Captain's briefing, that you will be hungry, and that perhaps we could dine together, and compare experiences. I'd like that. As will I. Will he be with us? Well, until we find our own method of communication. I look forward to that time. As do I. I'm sorry, Data. Begin the briefing. The factions on Solais V are historical enemies. So many have died that both societies are nearly extinct. Enough. Thank you, Captain, there is no need to continue. The specific issues of the conflict have no relevance. So, none of the background would be helpful in understanding why they continue to fight? The conflict will be over some land, or wealth, or some other tangible asset. But we both know that is not the case. They've been at war for so long, it has become personal. Exactly. The basis for peace must also be personal. This is an historic confrontation, correct? The factions have been at war for 15 centuries. What's changed? I do not understand. They have fought for a long time. Now they want peace. So something about the situation has recently changed. What's the new piece to the puzzle? Unknown, sir. Perhaps they've run out of people to kill. Whatever the reason, peace is now preferred, which should make your job easier. Well, if not easier, at least possible, for now they are motivated. It doesn't matter, I'll find something. I always have. Always? To date, I have never failed. Now, unless there is something else... No. This is entirely for your benefit. Then thank you for your time and effort. I have to get ready for a dinner appointment. If you will excuse me. Yes, of course... The meeting is adjourned. Our mediator is very self-assured. We'll know soon if he can deliver. We're now approaching Solais V. Half impulse. Slowing to one half impulse. The sound of this ship is quite remarkable. Can't you feel it? It moves through my body like a great pulse. I forget it's there. It's easy to let that happen. Sometimes we must allow the surroundings to flow over us, to dwell on each separate part, how it feels, to allow it to fill you. How do we communicate? You can read lips, but I need your words. Words... ..are... here on top. What's under them, ... ..their meaning... ..is what's important. Yes, that's true. We both know... ..how to express... ..important words, like... ..dream. Being here with you... Yes. Being here with you now is very special to me, too. Standard orbit. Captain, I'm reading laser activity on Solais V. How concentrated is the activity? It is localized, but very intense. So much for the ceasefire. Hailing frequencies. I'm receiving one side only. This is Capt Jean-Luc Picard, Commander of the Federation Starship USS Enterprise. If you continue to violate the ceasefire, I will abort this mission. You have no jurisdiction here, Picard. Where is Riva? Riva is in charge of the summit. I command the ship that brings him. I will not endanger this ship under any circumstances. The other faction is breaking through, sir. Riva gave his word we would speak to no one else. Now who breaks the rules? Where is Riva? I shall summon him. Get Riva here. Counsellor Troi, have Riva report to the bridge. They need you on the bridge, now. The ceasefire has been broken. I'm sure I can resolve that. Put them on the view screen. Viewer on. The quality of transmission is very poor. It is sufficient. Brothers, your bravery as fighters is known. Now you must demonstrate courage in a new way. Cease hostilities. Allow us to meet. The laser fire has ceased. For how long? These Solari don't seem likely candidates for peace. I need to see a topographical overlay of the battle area to pick a site for the meetings. Then I will need your help in creating the proper setting. Worf, prepare your security team. Yes, sir. That's not necessary. But it is prudent. I prefer to arrive with the smallest possible complement. We must not add to an already tense situation. If that is your judgement, so be it. We will provide whatever you require. Thank you, Captain. There. Beam us down to that hilltop and inform the factions to join us. The time for killing has come to an end. Phasers on stun. You won't need those. I'm sure we won't. Energize. Yes, this will do. We must set this up properly. Commander, if it is possible, I would like torches here, ... and here. Engineering, this is the away team. Yes, Commander? We need your help. I thought you might. We would like two torches. Head high? And what else? A table, here. Describe it. Three-sided and, if possible, made to resemble indigenous rock. Did you read that? Yes. That's no problem. When will the emissaries arrive? It shouldn't be too long. How long will negotiations take? They won't go quickly. They're coming, Commander. The first few minutes will be tense. Stay calm. Do not respond, even if you are provoked. We'll do our best. Who is Riva? I am Riva. Be at ease. I commend you both. To come here proves not only your courage, but your wisdom. Please, give this conference a chance. I have no magic. You have fought all your lives. You have known only... No! Never! Death first! Don't! Traitor! No, wait. Away team to Enterprise, beam us up now! His words are not mine. Please, Riva... We need you. How did this happen? A surprise. A member of one faction didn't like the idea of peace. I don't understand what you're saying. Counsellor? Riva, ... go slowly. Can you write it out? I am so sorry that your friends were killed. I'm sorry, I don't know what you are trying to tell me. We have to find some way to communicate. Data, he knows a gestural language. Find out which one and learn it. Counsellor, try sickbay. Maybe Pulaski can help. Listen to me. You are not alone! Do you understand? We are all in this together now. Captain's log, supplemental. We are monitoring increased military activity on Solais V. I fear that without Riva, we cannot keep the Solari from destroying themselves. How's it going? I have eliminated all but five distinct forms of signing. I will learn them all. Computer, show me gestural language designation M-9. Very interesting. A technique of communication that is both silent and covert. It could be very useful. Gestures and hand signals predate the spoken word in most cultures. Only the Leyrons of Malkus IX developed a written language first. Computer, continue presentation. Increase. Come. How's our mediator? The same. He's withdrawn. He's very frightened. All his life he's been in control, but now he doesn't have any answers. The doctor gave him a complete medical examination. His condition is hereditary. His brain can't receive auditory information. So all the prosthetics and surgical techniques I can use wouldn't work. I don't know how we can help him. I can't do anything. It's up to him and he's stopped cooperating. Counsellor, couldn't you...? Confidence is faith in oneself. It can't easily be given by another. You're right, of course. Come. Captain, I have reviewed and stored five distinct signing languages. Here is an example. This is blue. This is the blue ocean. This is the blue ocean at sunset. This is two people walking on the beach by the blue ocean at sunset. This is two people in love on the beach by the blue ocean at sunset. This is... Enough. Let's talk to Riva. Riva, Cmdr Data has learned your sign language. Talk to us. It was my fault. I am responsible for their deaths. In my arrogance I thought no one could harm the great Riva. I am such a fool. You are not to blame. What happened appears to be the work of one desperate man. It may not reflect the feelings of others. They were more than my interpreters. They were also my friends. They were a part of me. I did not realise how much a part... until now. We have been contacted by the factions on Solais. They want to renew negotiations. I cannot. I will not. Don't turn away. You have a chance to make some good come out of this. This could be the catalyst which binds them together. Someone else must speak with them, not me, not after what I allowed to happen. How could I? But Data understands you. Use him. Let him explain your words. When Data speaks for me, can you hear my anguish, my despair? Data is a fine machine, but he cannot replace my chorus. It took years to develop a communication. That cannot be easily replaced. The Solari need you. I cannot help them. Captain, please take me back to Ramatis. That is regrettable. A lot more people are going to die. It's possible to install optical devices which look like normal eyes. They'd still give you about the same visual range as the visor. Done? You say almost. How much reduction? 20 percent. There is another option. I can attempt to regenerate your optic nerve and, with the aid of the replicator, fashion normal eyes. You would see. I thought that was impossible. I've done it twice, in situations somewhat similar to yours. Geordi, it would eliminate the constant pain you are under. Why are you hesitating? When I came here, it was to talk about modifying this. And now you're saying I could have normal vision? I don't know. I'd be giving up a lot. There's something else you must know. This is a one-shot. You can't change your mind, or go back. And there are risks. I can offer choices, not guarantees. This is a lot to think about. I'll get back to you, Doctor. The Captain will take you home. But first, he's given me permission to attempt to settle the conflict. Yes. We've come so far, and paid such a terrible price, I must try. Help me. You would be better off without my help. I have never attempted anything like this before. When dealing with two factions so diametrically opposed, so entrenched in their positions, where do you start? You want to know if I had some special technique? I want to know anything that could help. There is no trick. I had no magic. What about your chorus? Yes, my chorus was special. They allowed me to combine different perceptions. So there was a trick? Not really. My technique was to look for something, no matter how small, that was common to both groups, and then to begin a process where one person or group expresses themselves to each other. That's very hard to accomplish. Yes. But what is even more difficult is to get each side to listen, really listen, to each other. And to understand. This isn't going to be easy for me. You are very good with people. But what I do is different. The real secret is turning disadvantage into advantage. Why can't you do that? Why can't you turn your disadvantage into an advantage? That is interesting. That would give them something in common. I do not understand, Counsellor. To what is he referring? Thank you... Thank me? Ah. I will have the Captain contact them on the planet and tell them to prepare for your return. No life signs in the immediate area. Alright, but stay sharp. Set phasers on stun. Energize. The area is clear, Commander. Put the table over there. Engineering, this is Riker. Sir? You can beam everything down now. Light the torches, to let them know that I am back. It may be a while before they arrive. They'll be more cautious after the last incident. You may leave whenever you choose. I will send a message when I am ready. I don't understand. How can he mediate without his interpreters? He can't even talk to them. He's going to teach them to sign. Yes. It is turning a disadvantage into an advantage. Learning sign will be a part of their process of learning how to live in peace. While they are learning how to communicate with Riva, they'll learn to communicate with each other. And that is the most important aspect of any relationship. Counsellor, it took me only moments to learn sign language. It will take them months. Time well spent. These people have been fighting all their lives. They know only hatred, suspicion and fear. Even with my chorus, I couldn't have changed their attitudes in a day. We have a chance. They want these talks to be successful. I'm still not comfortable leaving you here alone. Thank you for your concern. I will be fine. And thank you... for everything. Enterprise, four to beam up. Good luck. First Officer's log, stardate 42479.3. We leave the Solais system, confident that Riva will help the Solari achieve a lasting peace. Coordinates set. Take us out of orbit. Come. You wanted to see me? Yes. You read me well enough to sense how I feel about you... and what you do on this ship. But I wanted to say the words. Thank you. Well done. "
S2E06,"Medical log, stardate 42437.5 Ira Graves is arguably the greatest human mind in the universe. He lives in near isolation on a remote planet, devoting full time to his research. Eight hours ago, his assistant urgently requested medical aid. I only hope we can reach him in time. Any response from Gravesworld? Not since their initial communication. They ask for help, then cut off transmission, so they can't tell if any help is on the way. Ensign, what's our ETA at the planet? 36 minutes to orbit, sir. Starfleet considers Graves's molecular-cybernetics work to be at a critical stage. They consider this a priority-one action. A man is ill. Treating him is my priority one, regardless of who he is. Why does Data want to see us? He mentioned his new image. He's been acting kinda strange. How so? If I didn't know better, I'd say he was showing signs of insecurity. But you do know better. Androids don't feel such things. Sometimes I think he's becoming more human than any of us realise. Come in. Data? Geordi? Is Counsellor Troi there? Yes, Data. Geordi said you wanted to see us. Indeed. Or, stated more correctly, I wanted you to see me. Can we come in? Please. Did you damage your face, Data? It is a beard, Geordi. A fine, full, dignified beard. One which commands respect and projects thoughtfulness and dignity. Well? Opinions? It's very... different. When I stroke the beard thusly, do I not appear more intellectual? I'm sorry. I have to go now. Goodbye. Why was she laughing? We are receiving a transmission from Gravesworld, sir. It's unfocused, not directed specifically at us. On viewer, Mr Worf. If anyone can hear me, please send a doctor. Things are getting worse. Try and raise her, Mr Crusher. Tell them we're only minutes away. It's no good, sir. They're not receiving us. She and Graves live on the planet alone, sir. Then what scared her? Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain, I am picking up a signal, but not from the planet. On screen, Mr Worf. The signal is weak. Audio only. Pipe it through. Mayday! This is the USS... requesting assistance. The outer hull breached, environmental systems compromised. The Constantinople is in that vicinity. She's a transport ship, used to ferry settlers. I'm showing 2,012 colonists aboard. Outer-hull breach. Must be an internal explosion. If so, they'll all be prone to severe hypoxia. Their lives are at risk. We've got to help them. What about Graves? He is one man. Why not execute a long-range transport of an away team to assist Graves? We'd be out of warp long enough to energize the beam. A touch-and-go down-warping? Ensign, prepare to make it so. Aye, sir. Engineering. Mr La Forge? We'll execute a near-warp transport. This may be tricky. I want you to do it. Yes, Captain. I'm on my way. Assemble an away team. Include whoever the Doctor needs. Sir, hundreds on the Constantinople may need emergency attention. I should be there to supervise. Who will replace you? Lt Selar. She has my complete confidence. Worf, let's go. Phaser on stun, Mr Worf. We don't know the situation. Don't take chances. Agreed, sir. Now, remember. In a near-warp transport, the effects may be unusual. What do you mean? You'll see. Energize. Wait. I don't understand. You do now. For a moment, I thought I was stuck in that wall. For a moment, you were. Data to Enterprise. I read you, Commander. Go ahead. We are inside Graves's home. All is quiet, but no one knew we were coming. Use caution but protect Graves's health at all costs. Understood, sir. I suggest we see if anyone is home. No need, Commander. You heard me. Thank God. I'm Kareen Brianon, Dr Graves's assistant. We're from the Enterprise. We monitored your call but you never acknowledged us. Sorry. I couldn't take the chance. Chance? What chance? The chance I might find out someone was coming. Kareen knew I would not be pleased, to put it mildly. I had no choice. I refuse to just watch you deteriorate. What symptoms have you noticed? Pain. Shortness of breath. Irritability. Ridiculous! I'm as healthy as a Rigelian ox. He's not himself, believe me. His temper is out of control. Nonsense! Ira! I am a doctor. Lt Selar. No offence, but I don't want you touching me. I don't like people much and I like doctors even less. I thought most doctors were people. You're wrong. Ask any patient. Though, for a doctor, you're not a bad-looking woman. What have we got here? Another lovely specimen of womanhood. I thought you didn't like people. Women aren't people. They're women. I'm Deanna Troi. It's an honour to meet you. Of course. This is one of the great moments of your life. Excuse me, sir, are you a Romulan? Hardly. He's a Klingon, Kareen. Kareen's lived here since her father died when she was young. I taught her all she knows of unhuman races. Klingons and Romulans don't look much alike, Kareen, even though they act much alike. Must I stand here and be insulted? No insult intended, Mr Klingon. You see, Doctor, there's nothing wrong with my hearing. My...! Lt Cmdr Data... Absolutely no aesthetic value whatsoever. Looks like Soong's work. Correct. Did you know Dr Soong? Know him? I taught him everything he knows. You could say that I was the father of his work. Which kinda makes me your grandfather, sonny. Damn doctors! Always sneaking up on one. Attacking from the rear. Go on, gorgeous. Spit it out. Whatever it is, I can take it. I've checked twice to make certain. You have Darnay's disease. I'm sorry, Dr Graves. It's in its final stage. Can't you do something for him? In all cases, Darnay's is terminal. Captain's log, stardate 42437.7. We've repaired the stricken liner, Constantinople. 46 of her people suffered injuries, mostly minor. They have been treated and supplied with medicines. We are heading back to Gravesworld at speed. I have noticed, Doctor... Call me Grandpa. Seems more touching in my final hours. I have noticed, Grandpa, that you keep repeating a musical phrase I am unfamiliar with. It's an ancient little tune called If I Only Had A Heart. A plaintive lament sung by a mechanical man who longs to be human. It's his only wish. What happens to him? He finds out he's human after all. Always was. Just worried so much, he never realized it. A happy ending. The mechanical man gets his wish. Stories often have happy endings. It's life that throws you for a loop. It must be so hard for you, to be so close to being human and yet never really knowing what it's like to know pain. But... ..pain is unpleasant, is it not? Pain. Lust. Envy. Pleasure. Desire. Do you know what desire is, Data? Desire? To long for, to crave, a wish, a request. Do you know what desire is? No. I do not suppose I will ever really know. I feel pity for you. Your existence must be a kind of walking purgatory. Neither dead nor alive. Never really feeling anything. Just existing. Listen to me. A dying man takes the time to mourn a man who will never know death. Funny, isn't it? Funny. I have had great difficulty determining what funny is. I've had the same difficulty most of my life. We're much alike. I'd say he has a week. That's an estimate. The disease attacks the brain and nervous system. We can expect more erratic behaviour of the kind you've noticed. His feelings towards you are very warm. He is attracted to you in many ways. Attracted? I know I've felt certain feelings from him. And for him. Had I been older, perhaps we could have been... That's not the way it worked out. And now it's like he's afraid to face me. The only one he talks to is your friend, Data. You mentioned your impending death, Grandpa. You face it with remarkable courage and stoicism. That is because I am an incredible man, possessing an iron will and nerves of steel. Two traits that have helped me become the genius I am today and the lady-killer I was in days gone by. You condone homicide, sir? It's an expression, Data. It means I was once as beautiful as I am smart. Really, Grandpa? No, not really. But, what the hell? I'm dying. I can remember my life any way I want. But I'll let you into a little secret, sonny. I don't really believe I will be dying. But the Doctor... I'll die. But I won't really be dead. You see, I believe I've learned to transfer the wealth of my knowledge into a computer. Before I die, I plan to transfer my great intellect into this machine, thus cheating the Grim Reaper of his greatest prize. But what would you know of death? It is a subject forever alien to you. That is not necessarily true. I do have an off button, if you will. Its activation robs me of my consciousness, therefore rendering me dead. I do not enjoy contemplating it. I can understand that. Just where would Soong position such a device? Don't tell me. Let me guess. Captain to away team. We're standing by. I do not wish to interrupt Data and the Doctor. They have a rapport. But the Enterprise is in orbit. I'd like to transfer Graves to the ship. That will not be necessary, Doctor. He is gone. Gone? It happened a few moments ago, in my arms. Ira Graves... is dead. Captain's log, supplemental. I leave Gravesworld with the knowledge that our mission was unsuccessful. Whatever scientific secrets Ira Graves was about to unlock have been lost for ever. Our priority is to reach a star base so that Graves's assistant can get on with her life. Why didn't you contact Dr Selar when you saw that he was beginning to go? It would have been pointless. All things must pass. May I go now, sir? Yes, of course. We will try to honour him in the manner in which he specified? I said we would, Data. I am glad, sir. It was his dying wish. Hello, Data. It's good to see you again. The stars are so beautiful from space. You always did love the sky. A stargazer. That is what you are. Did Ira tell you that? I guess he's right. I used to spend hours just lying on a hill, looking up. Ira never told you how beautiful you were to him. He never told you, did he? He could not tell you. Do you understand? Yes. I understand. But he wanted to. Every waking moment. He wanted you to know that. You were everything to him. He was a fine man. A man of rare gifts... ..and great accomplishments. He will be sorely missed. Anyone else have anything to say? I have a few words to say, sir. Just look at that face. The face of a thinker. A warrior. A man... ..for all seasons. Yes, Ira Graves was all that and more. But he was not perfect. Perhaps his greatest flaw was that he was too selfless. He cared too much for his fellow man, with nary a thought for himself. A man of limitless accomplishments... ..and unbridled modesty. I can safely say that to know him was to love him. And to love him... ..was to know him. Those who knew him... loved him, ... ..while those who did not know him... ..loved him from afar. Data. I'm almost finished, sir. You are finished. We now commit the body of Ira Graves to the timeless depths of space. I am sorry, sir. Perhaps my admiration for Grandpa got the best of me. Grandpa? That is how I think of him. My only living relative. No longer living. Data... I was only trying to carry out his wishes, sir. I wanted to keep my promise to him. I know that, Data. Look, I realise you've been studying the human equation with great alacrity, but perhaps you've been working at it too much. Don't try so hard to be human. Just be yourself. Alright? Yes, sir. I will work on staying within myself. Grand. You're dismissed, Mr Data. Thank you, sir. Captain's personal log. Data has assured me that his odd behaviour will return to normal, but I think something went wrong on Gravesworld. I'm still concerned, Captain. I've never seen him act like this. Could it be the grandfather analogy that Graves planted in his head? Data is an orphan, in a manner of speaking. Is it possible that the loss of Graves might have affected him? Touched him on some emotional level we didn't know he possessed? I hope you're right. I hope that's all it is. That was a great speech, Data. ""To know him is to love him is to know him."" Verbal composition at its most sophisticated level. Your childlike mind cannot appreciate the wisdom of my words. Childlike mind? When you get to be my age, you will understand. Your age? Data, chronologically, you're not much older than I am. You are only as old as you feel. Try to remember that, boy. Are you turning into a philosopher? I am many things. Scholar, artist, philosopher, ... ..lover, genius. Data, what's wrong with you? How beautiful! I thought you'd enjoy the bridge. I'm aware of your interest in science. I'm aware of your interest in her. What was that, Commander? Nothing, sir. Nothing at all. These are the science stations. From the command centre, we have control of the science stations... Data, what are you doing? I detest hypocrisy. I wish they would just admit it! Admit what, Mr Data? That your interest in Kareen is not purely professional. Try as you will, you cannot win her heart. She does not care for older men. Or men of limited intellect. Mr Data, you will come with me now. Do you understand me? I understand. I understand all too well. Removing the competition will not help you, Picard. Excuse me. Do you know what that was about? Jealousy. Intense, burning jealousy. A human emotion and it was coming from Data. If you wish to apologize, I am prepared to listen. You expect me to apologize to you? You were a bit rude to me. Might make you feel better if you said you were sorry. Data, something is wrong with your circuitry. Ridiculous. I'm as healthy as a Rigelian ox. I wish I could believe that. I would accompany you to sickbay but I doubt if that would help. Sickbay? Are you ill, Captain? I'm getting there. I'll have Engineering run a full physical on you. That will not be necessary. I can run a circuit check on myself. It will immediately determine any abnormalities. Do it. That's an order. As I expected, I am fine. Could not be better. For the first time since I've known you, I don't believe you. Try and hold still, will you, Data? Data, wait for me in the corridor. Why should I? This concerns me more than you. You will wait for me in the corridor. His insubordination is growing by leaps and bounds. I could use discipline, but I'd rather try and help him. I wish I knew what to suggest. I can't find a thing wrong with him. Perhaps we're looking in the wrong place. Meaning? If his physical health is good, perhaps his mental health should be addressed. Are you saying Data's losing his mind? With your permission, Captain, there is a way to find out. You remember the psychotronic-stability examination? We all had to take it before graduating. It was a waste of time then. It's a waste of time now. It will gauge your reactions to the images it projects. Watch the screen and let your mind go blank. The device will do the rest. It's safe to say that you're his best friend. Is it possible to speculate about what's happening to him? Well, sir, it's just a guess, but... ..sometimes he wants to be human so badly, he can taste it. I think he gets confused when his human qualities surface. Go on. Witnessing Graves's death may have been a catalyst for the... I have the test results. I ran them several times to be sure. To be sure of what? There are two disparate personalities within Lt Cmdr Data. Each distinctly different. A dominant and a recessive. He's an android. Is that possible? It must be. The dominant personality is unstable. Brilliant but vain, sensitive yet paranoid. I believe it is prone to irrationality. Of course. Sir? Nothing. Go on. It seems to have an especially strong hatred of you, Captain, or to a lesser degree, any authority figure. And the worst part is, it's growing. How do you mean? The alien persona is getting stronger and gobbling up what is left of the weaker ego, the Data we know. If something isn't done to stop it immediately, ... ..we will lose our Data for ever. Captain's personal log. We have arrived at Star base 6, where Miss Brianon will await transport back to Earth. I am greatly troubled by Cmdr Data's behaviour and fear it is related to the experiments of Ira Graves. Where is Data? He should be in his quarters. You ordered him not to leave. Tell me, where is Lt Cmdr Data? Current location, ten-forward. Lt Worf, will you go to ten-forward and keep an eye on Data? Don't interfere with his actions unless you hear from me. Worf here, sir. Acknowledged. I want to know more about what happened on Gravesworld. Lt Selar, report to the Captain's ready room. Hello, Kareen. Don't you think it's time we stopped pretending? You know who I am. You're Data. You do know who I am. Ira? It is me. I am here. I am alive. How? I deactivated Data and transferred my mind into his frame. I never imagined how much of myself I would retain. My feelings, my dreams... They won't let you get away with it. They'll try to stop you. How can they? It is my body now. It is out of their hands. How much time did Data spend with Graves? Most of the time we were there. Always alone? Yes. Always. Doctor, what was your impression of Graves? He seemed brilliant, egocentric, arrogant, chauvinistic. Sound familiar? Something wonderful has happened. I can take a deep breath now without feeling stabbing pain. I will never have to face death again. Think what I will accomplish over the next 1,000 years! What? I know what you're thinking. There is no need to worry. I will create an android body for you, too. We can witness the end of time together. Why are you crying, Kareen? I can love you now. The way I always wanted to. It was not right before. I was too old for you, too weak. Now I can be everything you want me to be. I won't let you put me in a machine. I want to live my life. I won't let you take it away from me. Ira, you're hurting me! Worf to Capt Picard. Data has left ten-forward. Should I follow? Negative. I'll handle this. He was an expert in cybernetics? Yes. Our memorial service may have been premature. What an achievement. ""So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, So long lives this... ..and this gives life to thee."" He was working on bridging the gap between man and machine. It seems he built that bridge. I may be forced to tear it down. I can hear you coming, Captain. My ears are better than the average dog's, you know. I know who you are and what you've done. Of course you do. I came here to talk to Data. I cannot allow that. I understand your desperation. The shock of learning you were dying. But you had no right to do what you have done. I had every right, Captain. I am man, he is machine. There is no question who must live and what must die. What of Data? Data? Before me, he was nothing. Just a walking tin can with circuits for intestines. Pathetic. Without heart, a man is meaningless. I would not come up if I were you, Captain. I might not like it. You are most fortunate, my dear Captain, that I am not a violent man. Not a violent man? This is not my fault. They told me I should not be here. They should not have done that. Graves, listen to me. No one denies the significance of your transformation. But I don't believe this was part of your plan. Encountering Data was mere coincidence. One that offered you more than you could have dreamed. But something has gone wrong. Look here. This experiment must be terminated. This is idiotic! Picard to sickbay. Yes, Captain? How is Miss Brianon? Her left hand is fractured in two places. We've begun treatment. I'm afraid there are two more injuries in Engineering. I'm on my way. Who's next? These were all accidents. I did not intend... How many more accidents? You must leave this body. No. I live here now. Every man has his time. Every man, without exception. But you've cheated. You have extended your life at the expense of another. Graves, give Data back. Give him back. Data is dead. No. He must not be lost. He's not simply an android. He's a life form, entirely unique. Data is not human! He is... He is different, yes. That does not make him expendable, or any less significant. No being is so important that he can usurp another's rights. Set him free! No! How many... How many more accidents? Data, where is he? Just take it easy. I can't afford to take it easy, Doctor. Tell me, where is Lt Cmdr Data? Data, can you hear me? Geordi. Yeah. May I ask a question? I think you just did. Correct. Then may I ask another question after this one? You can ask me anything you want. Why am I on the floor in an undignified position with you four standing over me, with expressions of... I've heard more than enough. You're you again. Captain, look at this. He's in there. Ira put himself in the computer. Captain's log, supplemental. We said goodbye to Kareen, hoping that her future will be bright. The intellect of Ira Graves is now in our computer. There is knowledge but no consciousness. The human equation has been lost. You don't remember anything? Not a thing. ""To know him is to love him is to know him."" Perhaps it is best that I do not remember. I trust I did nothing unbecoming to a Starfleet officer? Does wrestling with a Klingon targ ring a bell? Mr Crusher, take us out of orbit. Aye, sir. Did I win? "
S2E07,"Captain's log, stardate 42494.8. The Enterprise is bound for Star Station India, to rendezvous with a Starfleet medical courier. We've been told only that our presence is imperative. Hopefully it will give me further opportunities to assess the performance of our new Chief Medical Officer. Come. You wanted to see me, Captain? Yes, Counsellor. Come, sit down. Counsellor, ... you've had the opportunity to observe Dr Pulaski for some time now. How would you evaluate her as a Chief Medical Officer? I've never met a more dedicated physician. I would say she has a passion for her work. Yes, of course. I entirely agree. Is it possible that such consuming dedication could interfere with her judgement? I feel your concern, Captain, but I don't share it. Perhaps because I've been able to spend more time with her, and get to know her better. Yes, perhaps you're right. Captain, we're picking up a faint distress signal on an open subspace frequency. It appears to be from an adjacent sector. Respond on the same frequency. Are we locked on? Aye, sir. A voice transmission from the USS Lantree, a Federation supply ship. USS Lantree, this is Picard of the Enterprise. What is your emergency? Can't hold out any more... People dying... Too many to help... Still receiving their signal, but there is no message. Lantree, are you under attack? Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. USS Lantree, this is the Enterprise. Come in, Lantree. Replay that last transmission. Can't hold out any more... People dying... Too many to help... Have we a fix on her? 2.2 milli-parsecs, bearing 3-0 at 145 degrees, sir. Number One? We'd better take a look. What kind of vessel is she? A class-6 Federation supply ship, assigned to the Gamma 7 Sector. Capt LI Telaka commanding. Normal complement, 26 officers and crew. Armed? Class-3, defensive only. Is she still underway? Aye, sir. Adjust course to intercept. Warp seven. Adjusting course to intercept. Warp seven, sir. Engineering, transfer to bridge. Closing on the Lantree, Captain. Take us out of warp. Establish parallel course. Match speed. Yes, sir. Hailing frequencies. Open. Lantree, this is the Enterprise. Capt Telaka, this is Picard of the Enterprise. Do you read me? No life signs, Captain. Counsellor? Nothing, Captain. What else have we got nearby? No other vessels of any kind within two parsecs. No battle damage. All systems seem functional, sir. Everything is in perfect order. We have to board her, Captain. Possibly, Mr Worf. Number One? If we gain control of her remotely, we could activate the view screen and at least look at the bridge. Agreed. Computer, security override request. Identify. Picard, Jean-Luc. Captain, USS Enterprise. Request control access Starfleet ship USS Lantree, Isao Telaka commanding. Enter access code. Omicron omicron alpha yellow daystar 2-7. Enable. I have verified receipt of the Lantree's access codes. Grand. Commence operations. First, shut down the engines. Standing by. The Lantree computer reports access codes received and accepted, sir. Sickbay on alert, Captain. The Lantree is responding, sir. We have override control of her bridge, Captain. Alright. Let's have a look. Lantree bridge monitor engaging. Read anything, Doctor? Still no signs of life, Captain. Magnify. That must be Capt Telaka on the left. Let's look at him. Closer. My God. Looks like they had a battle with time. And lost. Heart, lungs, liver... Everything. What is it? They died of natural causes. Natural causes? What in nature could cause that? For the record, they died of old age. We've downloaded the Lantree's log, sir. Play back the Captain's last entry. Captain's log, stardate 42493.1. There are only six of us left. We've set course for the nearest Federation outpost, but I'm afraid it's too late. Attempts to analyze what is happening have failed. In the last few hours I've watched friends grow old and die, and it's happening to me. Capt LI Telaka, USS Lantree... Capt Telaka was my age, sir. Doctor? Every member of the Lantree crew had a complete examination eight weeks ago. They were in perfect health. Nothing else since? A single medical entry noting that the first officer had Thelusian flu five days ago. Thelusian flu? An exotic but harmless rhinal virus. It couldn't have caused this. The Lantree's last port of call was the Darwin Genetic Research Station on Gagarin IV, three days ago. It could be something the crew had or it could've come from Gagarin. At the very least, the people from Darwin Station deserve a warning. We may have to consider quarantine. We should quarantine the Lantree. Absolutely. Lieutenant, initiate the Lantree's quarantine transmitters, and activate marker beacons. We'll need to find her again. Aye, sir. Quarantine warnings active on all frequencies, Captain. Extreme caution. USS Lantree is a quarantined vessel by order of Starfleet Command. Set course for Gagarin IV. Warp seven. Course and speed set, sir. Engage. Captain's log, supplemental. We're en route to the Federation Research Station on Gagarin IV. The mere thought of a connection between the Lantree tragedy and a genetic-research facility fills me with great apprehension. Approaching Gagarin IV, sir. Standard orbit. Hailing frequencies. Open. Darwin, this is Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise. Enterprise, this is Darwin Station. I'm Dr Kingsley. We've just declared a medical emergency. We need your help. Dr Kingsley, what is the nature of your emergency? To whom am I speaking, please? Dr Pulaski, Chief Medical Officer. Katherine Pulaski, author of ""Models of Viral Propagation""? That was long ago. But still the standard. I can't think of anyone better to deal with. We're experiencing the rapid onset of geriatric phenomena. The first symptom is sudden, acute arthritic inflammation. Then the ageing process accelerates. The Lantree. Dr Pulaski, I celebrated my 35th birthday a week ago. We know Darwin Station is involved in genetic research. Is there a possible connection? Our research is on human genetics. This is not something that got away from us. We believe we were infected by a supply ship three days ago. If you're speaking of the Lantree, we encountered it a few hours ago. All the crew were dead. Which would confirm our suspicion. Could you establish a pathology, Doctor? Doctor, did you hear me? All the 26 men and women aboard were dead. I heard you, Captain. The prognosis is alarming, but my concern is our children. Children? They represent years of genetic research. You must evacuate them. I'm sorry, but until we know what's going on, I'm imposing a full quarantine on Darwin Station. But the children have been in protective isolation. They show no symptoms. You cannot leave them to die. Doctor, our options in a quarantine situation are very limited. We will consider the possibilities. I suggest you do the same. I recommend against contact. Number One? I have to agree. The risk is too great. Doctor? If the children are free of disease, they should be evacuated. I'd like to bring one aboard in a force field for an examination. Counsellor, do you sense anything? Dr Kingsley sincerely believes the children are not a threat. But she's not telling the whole truth. I recommend caution. We have only Dr Kingsley's assurance that the children are not infected, whereas we have seen the results of this disease first-hand. In a case like this, I think we should err on the side of caution. Alright. We could beam up one child encased in styrolite in suspended animation. That way I could scan for possible infection without danger to ourselves or the child. We don't know what to look for. Exactly. And we won't until we start gathering data. Captain, that's worth some risk. There's always risk, Doctor. Undertake an examination. But I shall need positive proof that these children are harmless before I place my crew in jeopardy. The force field's ready, Captain. Activate it. Transporter? This is Chief O'Brien, sir. Almost ready. Is there a problem? It's the styrolite. I'm altering the delta-T so it materializes two microseconds ahead. It has to be right. Take your time. Entering corrections now. Ready, Captain. Dr Kingsley, are you ready to transport? You have the coordinates. We have a 12-year-old male in styrolite. Transporter, ... energize. A trick! Reverse... One moment. He's still in stasis. The styrolite is intact, Captain. Force field down. Captain, there's a definite presence, a distinct personality. Even in stasis it's quite strong. The child is certainly telepathic. A child this mature? We could be looking at the future of humanity. At least Dr Kingsley's vision of it. He's in better health than we are. His immune system is so advanced he may be unable to contract disease. I want to free him from the styrolite. That seems rather risky. I can do no further tests until he's out. But what if you're wrong? You saw what happened on the Lantree. I know I'm right. I can't expose us. Not till we know more about the disease. Naturally, we'll establish a force-field containment. But if we lose the force field, we lose the ship. Force fields can fail and... We don't have much time. The children can't survive in the lab once their parents die. Look at him, Captain. He's a human being who needs help. But the risk is... Minimal! If you can show that he's biologically harmless, without risk to the crew, I'll do everything in my power to assist. And, Doctor, God knows, I'm not one to discourage input, but I would appreciate it if you let me finish my sentences occasionally. Deanna, do you have a minute? You've known the Captain for some time. I need some advice. I don't deal with him well. Meaning? My arguments don't have any effect. We just end up quoting regulations. He has such a dedication to his ship, he doesn't seem able to see the human side of things. What's the matter? Kate, I don't think he'd be where he is if he couldn't see the human side. Perhaps the two of you are similar. What do you mean? Let's just say, you both have well-established personalities. Dr Kingsley, this is Kate Pulaski. Do you have a decision? I'm afraid it's bad news. How can that be? The risk is too great. Until we know the cause of the disease... The children are harmless. Every test on them has been negative. I demand that you do something to save them. Please, Doctor. For God's sake, we haven't got much time. Stand by. I'll get back to you. Geordi, I need your help. What is it? I need to prove the children are harmless in a fail-safe environment. There's no area of the ship that can be sealed off with certainty. Sickbay has an isolated system. But it's not possible to totally cut it off. The only independent environment would be, say, a shuttlecraft. A shuttlecraft. Why didn't you say so? Come. Captain, I'd like permission to put the boy in a shuttlecraft. I can study him there without risk to anyone. What about you? I'll take that risk. Someone has to breathe the same air he breathes, to touch him. I'm volunteering to make that test myself. Doctor, you have a responsibility to this ship which... I also have a responsibility to humanity. The guidelines about contact with quarantined... You don't have to quote the rule book. You were saying...? Request approved. Captain, you said if I... Approved? I recognize that you're trying to satisfy my condition. Thank you. You sent for me? I did. You're qualified to pilot this shuttlecraft? Certainly. I had training in auxiliary space vessels at Starfleet Academy. I received... A more than passing grade, no doubt. Come aboard. We don't have much time. Shuttle bay three force field activated. The Captain definitely approved this? You'll take us a few hundred meters out and hold position. Begin shuttlecraft launch sequence. Good luck, Doctor. We are in position, Doctor. It's the only way to prove they're harmless. And if they are not? I hate to keep reminding you, but you are a machine. You'll be safe. That is by no means certain, but I was referring to you. Medical research is sometimes a risky business. It's all part of being human. Shall we proceed? Ready to transport. You have the coordinates, Chief O'Brien. Maintain position. Stand by. Standing by. Control, what's our status? We have a green panel. Stand by to transport. Aye, sir. Energize. Yes... I do. I understand you perfectly. How could you, Doctor? He has not said anything. Yes, he has. Troi is right. He's telepathic. Time? 0322 exactly. She's been in direct contact with the boy for 18 minutes. All systems functioning within normal specifications. The manufacturer will be pleased. I appreciate your help, but your bedside manner needs work. Bedside manner? Doctor? Doctor, I don't understand. What has happened? There was no warning. Explain. Arthritic inflammation. The first symptom of the disease. What can we do? Return the boy. Apparently the children are carriers. Chief O'Brien, are you ready? I have the coordinates of the isolation lab. Quickly. Shuttle One, hold position. Holding. Stand by to transport. It wasn't your fault. Tell us what you need, Doctor. There's nothing you can do. I won't make myself an exception to the Darwin quarantine. Shuttle One out. What is your condition, Doctor? Not exactly up to factory specs. I'm sorry. The pain is tolerable, thank you. Shall I set course for Darwin? We're already under quarantine. What do we have to lose? The Darwin Station crisis is no longer our most immediate concern, although Dr Pulaski's condition is linked with that emergency. Her safe return and that of Cmdr Data must take priority, please. Shouldn't Dr Pulaski be involved in this? Dr Pulaski may not have time to help herself. I suggest we beam them both back here. Cmdr Data is most likely immune, and surely the biofilter will... The biofilter won't protect us. The boy was transported twice, and still infected Dr Pulaski. Couldn't we adjust the biofilter? Alter it to screen out the cause of the disease? But we don't know the cause. We can't protect ourselves against the unknown. We need a filter that doesn't depend on known biological factors. We might try the trace. The transporter trace? The transporter keeps a record of all transmissions, a pattern. Usually it's stored for security purposes. But if we use the trace to control the reconstitution process... I don't think it's been tried before, but... theoretically it is possible. It means extensive modifications. Do it. There's no alternative. Where do we get the trace pattern? She's never used our transporter. Never? No, she's a woman of very strongly held opinions. What was her previous assignment? Her ship was the Repulse. Bridge, Picard. Contact the USS Repulse using subspace captain's priority channel. Dr Pulaski. I can only tell you how much I regret the burden we've imposed on you. On both of you. Cmdr Data is an android. He's unaffected. As for me, I chose this. I was convinced the children were safe. I still can't believe one of our children infected you. The evidence is fairly conclusive. But they were designed to resist disease. I think it's time we talked about that. Let me show you. Our ultimate achievement. The oldest is 12, and all are telekinetic. Watch. Genetically engineered? Not engineered, created. Perfect in every way. Their body structure, their musculature, their minds. You were telling me about their immune system. That was our masterpiece. We gave these children an aggressive immunity. We others were infected by the supply ship, but they were protected. The Lantree logs show only one crewman had any illness prior to arrival here. The First Officer had a mild Thelusian flu. Yes, he was one who came into contact with us. The Thelusian flu would have no effect on you, but tell me, how would they react? Their immune systems would release an antibody to attack the virus. Even at a distance? Their immune systems don't wait for a disease's attack. It seeks out a virus and destroys it. Destroy it? How exactly? The antibody would adapt itself to alter the genetic code of the virus. Commander, I want an analysis of the interaction between the Thelusian flu and the children. On a molecular genetic level? We don't have time for that. Genetic analysis could take months. Not necessarily. Cmdr Data has a way with computers. Sorry, Picard, we erased Dr Pulaski's transporter pattern. She never used the transporter much. She preferred shuttles. I'd have given her a shuttle to keep her. If she served you as well as you say, why did you let her go? You haven't run into her stubborn streak yet. She found out about an opening on the Enterprise, and requested a transfer. Knew your service record backward and forward. Apparently she's been an admirer of yours for some time. Extraordinary. Commander, what have you got? The answer, I believe, Doctor. The Lantree was not the source of the disease, but the trigger. Trigger? The Lantree exposed your children to Thelusian flu for the first time. Their active immune systems set out to attack the virus. Once it was triggered, it kept going. The antibody created an unexpected side-effect. It alters the genetic make-up of normal humans. This is a comparison of the altered and normal DNA. These two molecules have been transposed. And since our DNA is self-replicating, the process... Is irreversible. Judging from what happened on the Lantree, anyone is a carrier once they're infected. Have you made progress, Doctor? I'm afraid so. The children don't carry the disease, they cause it. How? Their advanced immune system has created an antibody that changes normal DNA. The altered genes are the ones that control ageing. Why did it attack you more quickly than the others? The enclosed environment of the shuttle concentrated my exposure. The Lantree's First Officer carried the antibody onto his ship. It then affected his crew. What's the next step? The children will survive, but the rest of us are about out of time. Doctor, I want you back aboard. You'll come up in suspended animation. That will buy time. Thank you, but I got into this by leaping before I looked. I won't allow you to make the same mistake. Chief Medical Officer's log. This will be my final report to the Enterprise. Just as changes in evolution are known to be caused by changes in the environment, we now know the process also works in reverse. An attempt to control human evolution has resulted in a new species that's lethal to its predecessors. The children will be condemned to live out their lives in isolation. Quarantine of the Darwin Station must be maintained for ever. I am sorry I was not more helpful. You did everything you could. As androids go, you're in a class by yourself. Doctor... Please. Give my best to the Captain. Enterprise, Cmdr Data. Ready to beam aboard. Captain, Kate knew what she was doing. I wish I were sure we'd tried everything. Cmdr Data is ready to come aboard. You have the bridge, Number One. No life forms present, sir. You may step down, sir. Data, tell me, if... It's good to see you again. Thank you. If the changes in Dr Pulaski's DNA were reversed, is it possible... It is not reversible, sir. The molecular transposition... But if it were undone, would she be normal again? As normal as ever, sir. The transporter can be modified to filter out changes in Dr Pulaski? Yes, but we couldn't locate her trace pattern. Well, what if we used a sample of her DNA, say from a blood test taken before she was exposed to the disease? Could that filter the genetic changes? I'd have to patch in a molecular matrix reader. That's no problem. But the waveform modulator will be overloaded without the limiter. Interesting. But theoretically... Can you do it? I think so. Then make it so. You heard. Let's get those panels off. A blood test, a tissue sample, anything with Dr Pulaski's DNA. No, sir. Her records were shipped via Starfleet headquarters. They've not caught up with us. Ridiculous. A cell, a single cell. Let's check her quarters. Anything. A fingernail, a hair... Hairbrush. It has a follicle, sir. Live cells. Darwin Station, this is the Enterprise. Go ahead, Captain. I'm here. We may have a solution. We have a sample of your normal DNA to use as a filter in the transporter. We think that we can beam you aboard while filtering out the genetic problems caused by the disease. Interesting theory, Captain. If it works, we could use the same technique to save Dr Kingsley and her colleagues. I think you should know, this has never been attempted before. I know one thing. If I live through this,... ..Ill have a much better understanding of geriatrics. All set, Chief? Almost ready. Just one thing. Yes? This modification's one way only. If it fails, we can't transport the Doctor back to the planet. Then I'll operate the transporter controls myself. If she's going to be consigned to oblivion, then... Thank you, sir. I'll be monitoring the medical scans. You'll be able to tell if it's worked by watching the stack. Dr Pulaski, are you ready? I suppose I am, Captain. Here we go. It's not working. Captain, wait. Doctor. Good to see you. Welcome back, Doctor... Come. Captain, if this hadn't worked... If this hadn't worked, it would have been necessary to beam your energy into empty space. And spread my atoms across the galaxy? Yes. I'm sorry... No, don't be sorry. Every time I get into that thing, I'm sure that's what's going to happen. Chief Medical Officer's log, supplemental. The adults of Darwin Station have been restored to normal health. They remain on Gagarin IV to continue their research in hopes of one day rejoining their children. Impulse speed. There she is, Captain. Scientists believe no experiment is a failure, that even a mistake advances the evolution of understanding. Close to 40 kilometers. 40 kilometers. Aye, sir. But all achievement has a price. For one glimpse at the mysterious blueprint of human evolution, the crew of the USS Lantree paid with their lives. Their sacrifice is thus noted in this scientist's log. Number One. Lt. Worf, arm the photon torpedoes. Torpedoes ready, Commander. USS Lantree is a quarantined vessel by order of Starfleet Command. Do not board. Gentlemen. USS Lantree is a quarantined vessel by order of Starfleet Command. Do not board. Set course and speed for Star Station India. Course and speed set, sir. Engage. "
S2E08,"We are approaching Star base 179, sir. Half impulse, Mr Crusher. Going to half impulse. Captain, this is the bridge. We have arrived at Star base 179. Acknowledged, Number One. Establish position 090, mark 345 at 27,000 kilometers. Hailing frequencies. Open. Star base 179, this is the Enterprise. Enterprise, this is Star base 179. Ready for transfer on your mark. Cmdr Data, you have the bridge. Ensign Crusher, you're with me. Star base 179, we are ready to commence transfer. Acknowledged, Enterprise. Begin transfer. Welcome aboard the Enterprise. I'm Cmdr Riker, your First Officer. Those here as replacements, step outside and follow Lt Lewis. He will assign you to your crew quarters. Ensign, you're on the exchange programme. Follow Mr Crusher. Mordoc, how are you here? You can't have graduated already. I am not Mordoc. I am Mendon. Ensign Mendon, from the planet Benzar. Sorry. It's a friend of mine. You look just like him. We are from the same geostructure. Naturally, we look alike. How do you tell each other apart? We just do. It's nice to have you here, Ensign. Briefing and indoctrination begin in 15 minutes. I want to say how happy I am to be assigned to the Enterprise. It wasn't just luck. I requested it. I know I can be of great help to the ship. Yes. Of course. Just follow Mr Crusher. Yes, sir. Cmdr Riker, report to the phaser range, please. On my way. I wondered if you had any feelings about the officer exchange programme initiated by Starfleet. Just positive ones, sir. Actually, I just welcomed Ensign Mendon on board. He seems eager to please. Well, that's a Benzite trait. It's been suggested an officer from the Enterprise might participate. That's probably a good idea. Well, there is a Klingon vessel in the area. I don't recall a Federation officer ever serving on a Klingon vessel. No. Neither do I. It might prove beneficial. Having Worf on board certainly has been. Yes, sir. Who did you intend to send, sir? I thought of asking for a volunteer. I might be interested, sir. Damn! Sorry, what was that? I wouldn't mind the assignment, sir. Any particular reason? Because nobody's ever done it before. I'll inform Star base of your acceptance. They'll contact the Klingons, make the arrangements. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 42506.5. We have departed from Star base 179 and are headed for a rendezvous with the Klingon vessel, Pagh. I have informed the staff of Cmdr Riker's temporary assignment. I have studied everything about my heritage. Just the man I need to talk to. Is it true that a Klingon First Officer must assassinate his Captain? Yes, sir. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Of course not. When or if the Captain becomes weak or unable to perform, it is expected that his honourable retirement be assisted by his First. Your Second Officer will assassinate you for the same reasons. Must take a little getting used to. The Klingon system has operated successfully for centuries. It is different. Many things will be different. Can I help you, sir? A wonderful way to maintain constant control over defensive shields. But I'm sure there's a way to improve response time. Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt you. Just thought I could be of some help. However, I am correct in what I said. That is superb designing. Absolutely first-rate. Yes, it is. Would you care to be more specific? The input sampling. It's simple, yet efficient enough. A minor change of the helm read-out would be more helpful in emergency situations. We've never had problems with it. Have you seen it work? Not in a practical exercise. But in theory - my theory - it would be more than a marginal improvement. I'll mention it to the Captain. He is open to astute observations, isn't he? I've never known the Captain not to listen to his officers. Outstanding. Soon we'll get things running perfectly. What is that? A Klingon delicacy. Pipius claw. This is heart of targ. This, of course, is gagh. Yes, serpent worms. Like some? No. Thanks. I never heard of a Klingon starving on his own vessel, but you might. Not if I weaken first. Their beliefs are rather brutal, but usually what kills us kills them. That's good to know. Like something to drink? I'll abstain in honour of your last hour on board. Your sacrifice will not go unnoticed. I'm aware of the feast before the transfer. I've done it dozens of times. However, I usually made more palatable choices. Well, these are the more palatable choices. Thank you. We know so little about them. There really is so much to learn. This is a great opportunity. I envy you, Mr Riker. Thank you. Commander. An emergency transponder? Altered to give an omni directional signal and an emergency call. You suspect trouble? A security precaution. I want to ensure your return to this ship. Sentiment, Lt Worf? Efficiency, Commander. I understand. Thank you. We have a Klingon vessel approaching. Hailing frequencies. Open. They are returning our hail in proper language. It is the Pagh. On view screen. I'm Capt Picard of the USS Enterprise. This is Capt Kargan of the Klingon vessel, the Pagh. Beam your First Officer on board immediately. We are preparing to do so. And, Captain, you are getting a fine officer. Thank you for your opinion, but I will judge that for myself. Screen off. Not very hospitable, are they? That is not your concern. Observe your station, Ensign Mendon. Didn't mean to offend you. You didn't. Yet. Transporter, prepare to beam Cmdr Riker to the Pagh. Acknowledged, Captain. Mr Data, you have the bridge. Aye, sir. Good luck, Commander. Thanks, O'Brien. I wouldn't wanna go. Why? You're not afraid, are you? No, I'm not. I would be... Ready, sir. Thanks. Energize. Resume course, Mr Crusher. Aye, sir. Take over, Cmdr Data. I'll be in observation. Sir. I am Ensign Mendon. I just wanted to tell you how pleased I am to be aboard. Yes, of course. Good to have you aboard. If you have a few minutes, I've noted a few procedural changes which might speed up bridge operations. I pick things up very fast. Of course you do. You have an excellent record. However, on the Enterprise we use the chain of command. You will report your observations to Lt Worf. I beg your pardon. I just wanted to impress upon... No need to apologize. We should have explained at your indoctrination. Ensign Mendon. You may impress me. Is something wrong? No. It's just... ..Ive never seen anyone of your species before. I'm just an average, everyday human who happens to be a Commander. Now, what were your orders? To escort you to the Captain. Proceed. Yes, Commander. Cmdr William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. That is incorrect. I don't understand. You are Cmdr William Riker, First Officer of the Klingon cruiser, the Pagh. Or do you intend to disobey Federation orders? I have no such intention, sir. Exactly where are your loyalties, Commander? I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. This ship is equipped with our best weapons and our finest warriors. We are on a peaceful mission, but can be ready for battle, instantly. I know I can count on every Klingon warrior in this crew to serve and die in that battle. So I ask you again, Cmdr Riker. Where are your loyalties? I have been assigned to serve this ship and to obey your orders. I will do exactly that. Will you take an oath to that effect? I just did. This is your Second Officer, Lt Klag. Something you wanted to say to me, Lieutenant? Yes, sir. I do not believe you. Then you challenge my authority over you? Correct. And your position on this, Captain? I would say it is your first command decision. My oath is between Capt Kargan... and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to lieutenant? I will take your orders. And you, Cmdr Riker, will obey my orders. Of course, Capt Kargan. Sir, automatic scan has registered an unknown substance on the aft quarter of the exterior skin, dorsal section. Target it and define. Aye, sir. I've located it, sir. Dorsal of the Engineering section. View screen on. Focus on area. Magnification factor ten. Increase magnification to 50. Analyze. It appears to be a rare form of subatomic bacteria, capable of doubling itself in size every 15 minutes. It's reacting with two compounds present in the ship's structure. Origin? Captain. I noticed it when I did an intensive scan of the Pagh. The Klingon ship. And whom did you inform? No one. I have not yet completed my full analysis. You should report whatever is out of the ordinary. And I think that falls into this category. But, sir, I have not completed my full analysis. It would be improper to report it until then. How did you come to that decision? It is a Benzite regulation. No officer on our ships would report an occurrence like this without a full analysis and a resolution. I have simply followed proper procedures. It is our procedure, Ensign, to notify command of any possible danger to the ship. The decision is not yours. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Now, continue your analysis and determine the danger, not only to our ship, but to the Klingon vessel, also. Yes, Captain. That will take a couple of hours. Use whatever resources are necessary. We may have encountered a new life form. I want to know everything about it, quickly. Cmdr Data, supervise. Aye, sir. And then I will instruct you in Enterprise etiquette. First Officer's personal log. I have been aboard the Pagh a short time, but am impressed with the Klingons' abilities and single-mindedness. Commander, you're not eating very much. I'm not that hungry. Is the food alright, Commander? Delicious. The pipius claw was excellent. And the bregit lung. And the rokeg blood pie? Delicious. Good. Then you'll also enjoy... this. Isn't that gagh? Very good. You did some research on our nutritional choices. Yes, but, ... ..it's still moving. Gagh is always best served live. Would you like something easier? Easier? Yes. If Klingon food is too strong for you, perhaps we could get one of the females to breast-feed you. You're not worried about my weakening, are you? Look around you. There are no old warriors. No, sir. I'm sure they all died with honour. Exactly. You may live long enough to learn about us. He is not very attractive... ..but I will have him. They are inquisitive. They want to know how you would endure. Endure what? Them. One or both? I may be back for you. Is she serious? Yes. Commander, would you say you're... a typical Federation officer? I suppose so. Why? Well, you're not what I expected. In what way? You have a sense of humour. I was thinking the same about you. In all my dealings with Klingons, including our Lt Worf, the thought never occurred to me of Klingons laughing. There is much about us you do not know. That's why I'm here. You should ask. I may. After this tour, I may have some worthy questions. Questions about what? About our future? Our future is honour. Our present is serving this ship. Like you, I have a mother and a father. They look like me. I look like them. Are they still alive? My mother lives. My father was killed in battle at Tranome Sar. And your father? My... father? My father was captured in battle by Romulans and not allowed to die. He eventually escaped. Where is he now? He is on our planet. He waits. He waits for his death. He will fade of a natural illness and die, weakened and useless. Honourless. I will not see him. He's your father. A Klingon is his work, not his family. That is the way of things. He's your father. Klingons do not express feeling the way you do. Perhaps you should. We would not know how. Yesterday, I did not know how... to eat gagh. I can confirm the organisms feed on compounds in the Enterprise's hull. And the Klingon ship, the Pagh? They are more susceptible. Their hull contains more of the compounds. Projection. At this rate of reproduction, there should be a 12-centimeter opening in the Klingon hull. Signal them at once. They may be unaware of it and need help. Aye, sir. Change course to intercept. Aye, sir. It will take time to locate them. They are on manoeuvres in the Pheben system. Find them. Tell me, Cmdr Riker, what do you make of this? I felt no collision. Were we hit by a meteor? No collision. Corrosion, then? No, not corrosion. Science Station, analyse. We have. Fortunately, that section could with stand the change in pressure. Then what is it? A space organism, eating away at our hull. What are you talking about? Surely you can repair it? I'm afraid not. We estimate that in less than eight hours, we will have lost too much shell to remain intact. Our only contact recently was with the Enterprise. There was no direct contact with the Enterprise. Tactics Officer, report to Cmdr Riker. The Enterprise did conduct an extensive scan of this vessel. Normal procedure. What type of beam did the Enterprise use to cause this damage to us? None. Why would they? We're allies. My logs show that the Enterprise directed an intense scanning beam at this specific area, for a duration of two minutes. Explain that. I can't. It could be a weapon. It's no weapon. The Enterprise has no reason to do that. It makes no sense. Why? Why is no longer important. What is important is our response to this attack. Engage cloaking device. Set course to intercept the Enterprise. What do you intend to do, Captain? Intend? There is only one response. I intend to attack the Enterprise and destroy it. You're making progress. You've eliminated half the possibilities already. Thank you. But I seem to have become efficient after it was needed. It was my responsibility to learn and adapt to the Enterprise's regulations. And I didn't do that. Not really. You just made an error. Capt Picard may not like them, but he knows they turn up sometimes. I've failed. I had an opportunity to show the Captain my superior capabilities and I failed. I can never recover from that. Mendon, it was a mistake. You didn't put the organism on the hull, you discovered it. You were trying to analyse it and messed up on protocol a little. I realise you are being nice to me, and I appreciate it. What I don't understand is why. Why not? I thought you could use a friend. Thank you. I hope I can learn your ways before I mess up again. I imagine my methods must seem foolish to you. They're... different. But that's what this exchange is all about. You learn how we do things and take that back to your command. It's up to them to decide which is better. You're right. I'll do it your way. I'll work even harder than before and I'll succeed brilliantly. What is the status? Unchanged. The rate of increase continues. Cmdr Riker, check the organism growth with Engineering. Keep him under scrutiny. Captain, I'm not convinced Riker knew of any plot against us. If he did, why would he have come on board? Because he was ordered to. To die? It's the expectation of any officer to be ordered to die at any time. For a Klingon, perhaps. But Riker's people do not volunteer for death so easily. He may be a spy, ... ..but he's no coward. That only proves that he's intelligent. And you might not be as strong as you used to be. I've picked up the Enterprise. So soon? The Enterprise is on an intercept course with us. You almost had me believing this was a misunderstanding. But? The Enterprise has changed course and is following us. Why? Ask them. The reason is obvious. Their intent is clear. How long before we make contact? Less than 15 minutes. Put the ship on full battle alert. Arm all photon torpedoes. Let them charge into their destruction. Captain, bearings show we should be in contact with the Pagh now. Slow to impulse. Aye, sir. Impulse speed. Hailing frequencies are open. There is no response. Continue transmission. The Pagh is either cloaked or destroyed, sir. Conduct an intensive scan of the area. Enterprise has slowed to impulse. It is making an intensive sweep. Hold your position. Let them come to us. They may be here to help you. Don't be a fool. Do not forget my rank. I haven't. I am simply trying to help you understand. I understand fully. Now, you understand. I am still Captain of this vessel. You are still crew and sworn to obey me. You gave me your oath. Yes, sir, I did. Then fulfil that oath and serve this ship as you swore to. Tell me of the surest method of attack against the Enterprise. I won't. You must. It is a matter of honour and loyalty to your oath. I will not surrender the secrets of the Enterprise to you. If your word is no good, then how can we ever trust Starfleet? I will not break a vow I made in the past. I also made an oath to your ship. I will not break that. They are in conflict. No, sir, they are not. I will obey your orders. I will serve as First Officer. In an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. If you had told those secrets about the Enterprise, I would have labelled you a traitor and killed you where you stood. But instead you will die with us. You'll die like a Klingon. Sir, I have something to report immediately. Go ahead, Ensign. I have isolated the organisms. They are a submicron form, capable of breaking nuclear bonds in the tritanium. Can they be removed from the hull? Yes. They are controllable and can be removed from both ships by using a tunnelling neutrino beam. Thank you, Ensign. Well done. Initiate that procedure. Lieutenant, add that information to the hailing messages. Aye, sir. Lieutenant. The Enterprise has changed hailing message. It promises help in cleaning the organisms and in repairs. I told you, they're here to help. I do not believe them. Arm all weapons. Prepare to attack. Captain's log, stardate 42507.8. Although our search has been extensive we are still unable to locate the Klingon ship, or any evidence of its destruction. Considering the absence of debris, one must assume the Klingon vessel is in the area and cloaked. Agreed. Since we do not know its intent, I recommend we go to red alert. Make it so, Lieutenant. Aye, sir. The Enterprise has raised its shields. A normal procedure in a suspicious situation. It's not an act of aggression. They will not fire first. Then they are fools. For we will. You'll get only one shot. We'll only need one. Stand by on phasers and torpedoes. Prepare to fire them simultaneously. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 km. Why? To cut down their response time. You are honouring your promise to serve us? Would you do less? You will give the order to fire, Cmdr Riker. Call out distances. Any questions, Mr Riker? I'd like to say I question your judgement. In my opinion, your reason for this confrontation is not valid. Are you finished? Yes, sir. Commence with attack, as ordered. 55,000 km and closing. Is that a weapon, Commander? No, sir. Give it to me. We are receiving an emergency signal from a command transponder. Location 035, mark 313. Frequency and code designate Cmdr Riker. Chief O'Brien, lock on to that signal. Yes, Captain. We're not yet in safe range for a transfer. Defensive shields remain in place. We may have to stretch it. We must know what's going on, and only Cmdr Riker can tell us. Beam him directly onto the bridge on my command. Yes, sir. I'll wait till 40,000. 48,000. 44,000. Transporter room, stand by. You control the shields. Ready, sir. 40,000. 40,000 kilometers. Prepare to drop cloaking shields and fire when ready. Steady... Transporter room, energize. Hold where you are, Klag. I've relieved Capt Kargan. He was acting in an irrational manner. I'm your Captain now. Where am I? Aboard the Starship Enterprise. Riker has no honour. He tricked me. He is only dazed, sir. Well, that's fine, ... ..but where's Cmdr Riker? Cloaking shields off. Obey my orders. We will be destroyed. If we are, it will be in battle, and I will die with you. So I repeat, cloaking shields off. It is the Pagh, sir. It has all armament locked on us and ready to fire. Hold position. Hailing frequencies. Enterprise to Pagh. We are here to assist. Do not fire. They will not believe you. Pagh, we're here to assist. Do you read me? Enterprise, this is Capt William Riker of the Klingon vessel, Pagh. I order you to lower your shields and surrender. Lower shields. Surrender, as ordered. I demand to be beamed back aboard my vessel. Transporter Chief, prepare to beam Capt Kargan aboard the Pagh. Aye, sir. Capt Riker, we can carry out your repairs immediately. Thank you, Capt Picard. You should have killed me. I don't want your command. But you tricked me to get it. Either way, you can have it back. Then return to your station. Get him off my ship. Yes, Captain. You understand the Klingons better than I thought, Commander. Thank you, my friend. Almost the shortest assignment in the history of Starfleet. Wrong, Number One. It was almost the longest. Well done. Thank you. I learned quite a bit. Apparently, not when to duck. When not to duck would be more accurate. Welcome aboard, Number One. Lieutenant, conduct the Commander to sickbay. Aye, sir. Commander? Your little toy worked. Thanks. I'm glad it did. You come from a very brave and unique people. I'm glad you're with us on the Enterprise. Thank you, Commander. And... ..welcome home. "
S2E09,"Captain's log, stardate 42523.7 We are en route to the new Starbase 173 for port call. Crew rotation is scheduled and we will off-load experiment modules. That's my chair. My luck is lousy unless I start on the dealer's right. That seems to be superstition. Experience teaches me it's a truth. The game is five-card stud, nothing wild, ante up. This game is very simple. With only 52 cards, 21 of which I will see, and five players, there are limited winning combinations. There's more to this than the cards. Of course. The bets indicate the strength of each hand. Time to pluck a pigeon! Five. I'm in. l, too. Call. A seven and a six, the ace. I bet ten. See that. Call. Fold. Yeah, me too. I'm out. I bet five. Same. Your five. And five. Too rich for me. No help. I bet... ten. Your ten and ten. Is that what is known as a ""poker face""? Playing or not? I fold. You had nothing! He bluffed you, Data. It makes little sense to bet if you cannot win. I did win. I was betting that you wouldn't call. How could you tell? Instinct, Data. The game is seven card high/low with a buy on the last card. And just to add interest, the man with the axe takes all. My God! Phillipa Louvois. And back in uniform. It's been ten years, but seeing you again like this makes it seem 50. If we were alone, know what I'd like to do? Bust a chair across my teeth? After that. Ain't love wonderful? Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. So, ... what are you doing out here? I am in charge of the 23rd Sector JAG office. We're brand new. I have no staff, but one terrified little ensign. Hopefully we can make some good law here. Anything is possible. So you came back to Starfleet? The most worthwhile place to be. You had no reason to leave. They forced me out. No. That was your own damn stubborn pride. When I prosecuted you in the court martial, I was doing my job. You did more than that, you enjoyed it. Not true. A court martial is standard procedure when a ship is lost. It was my duty as a Judge Advocate General. You enjoy the adversarial process more than getting at the truth. I hope you've learned a little wisdom along the way. You know, I never thought I would say this, ... ..but it's good to see you again. It brings a sense of order and stability to my universe to know that you're still a pompous ass. And a damn sexy man. Capt Picard? Admiral. Capt Louvois. You know Capt Picard? Yes. We're old... friends. Excuse me. Picard, call me. You can buy me dinner. Captain, good to see you again. May I introduce Cmdr Bruce Maddox? Commander. He has an interesting proposal, but it can wait. I'm eager to see the Enterprise. Yes, sir. This way. Admiral on the bridge. I'm surprised at the decision to put a base so close to the Neutral Zone. We've had disturbing news from both sides of the Zone. We're here to respond when needed. And it won't hurt to have the Romulans know that we're nearby. I thank you for this opportunity. For 500 years, every vessel named Enterprise has become a legend. This one is no different. Admiral. Yes. Captain, Cmdr Maddox is here to work on your android. Please take care of him. How have you been, Data? My condition does not alter with time, Commander. You two are acquainted? I evaluated Data when it applied to the Academy. And was the sole committee member to oppose my entrance, because I was not a sentient being. What exactly will this work entail? I am going to disassemble Data. Alright, explain this procedure. Ever since I saw Data at the entrance evaluation at Starfleet Academy, I've wanted to understand it. I became a student of the works of Dr Noonien Soong, Data's creator, and I've tried to continue his work. I believe I am close to a breakthrough that will enable me to duplicate Dr Soong's work and... replicate this. But as a first step, I must disassemble and study it. Data is going to be my guide. It sounds intriguing. How will you proceed? I'll run a full diagnostic on Data, evaluate its current software, then dump its core memory into the starbase computer and begin a detailed analysis of its construction. You've constructed a positronic brain? Yes. You know how the electron resistance across the neural filaments can be resolved? Not precisely. That would seem a necessary first step. I am confident I will find the answer once I examine the filament links in your anterior cortex. If the answer is not forthcoming, your model will not function. I do not anticipate any problems. You seem a little vague on specifics. What are the risks to Cmdr Data? Negligible. Captain, I believe his basic research lacks the specifics necessary to support an experiment of this magnitude. Cmdr Data is a valued member of my bridge crew. Based on what I've heard, I cannot allow Cmdr Data to submit himself to this experiment. I was afraid this might be your attitude, Captain. Starfleet's transfer orders, separating Cmdr Data from the Enterprise and reassigning it to Starbase 173 under my command. Data, I will see you in my office tomorrow at 0900 hours. Come. You sent for me, sir. Data, please sit down. Well, we have a problem. I am in complete agreement with that assessment, sir. Your service to this ship has been exemplary. I don't want to lose you. I will not submit to the procedure, sir. I understand your objections. But I have to consider Starfleet's interests. What if Cmdr Maddox is correct, that it is possible many more beings like yourself could be constructed? Sir, Lt La Forge's eyes are far superior to human eyes. True? Then why are not all human officers required to have their eyes replaced with cybernetic implants? I see. It is precisely because I am not human. That will be all, Mr Data. Computer, pull all relevant information regarding Starfleet regulations on the transfer of officers. Working. My God, twice in as many days. I need your help. An historic moment. I have tried to make sense of this gobbledegook, but it's beyond me. The fact is, my android officer, Data, is being transferred compulsorily to be part of a dangerous, ill-conceived experiment. I want it stopped. He can refuse to undergo the procedure, but not the transfer. Once this Maddox has... got control of Data, anything could happen. I don't trust that man. We agree to certain risks when we join Starfleet. Yes. Acceptable risks, justified risks. But I can't accept this. It's unfair. He has rights. All this passion over a machine? Don't start. This is important to me. Is there an option? There is always an option. He can resign. I see. So you came to me for help? Yes. I came to you. You're the JAG officer for this sector. I had no choice but to come to you. Wait. I didn't mean it that way. I'm glad you felt you could... well, come to me. The word ""trust"" just isn't in your vocabulary, is it? Good try. Top marks for effort. I wish things were different. I wish I could believe that. ""When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes, I all alone be weep my outcast state."" Is it just words to you? Or do you fathom the meaning? Is it not customary to ask permission to enter an individual's quarters? I thought that we could talk, that I could try to... persuade you. Your memories and knowledge will remain intact. Reduced to the mere facts of the events. The substance, the flavour of the moment, could be lost. Take games of chance. Games of chance? Yes. I had read and absorbed every treatise and book on the subject. I was well prepared for the experience. Yet, when I finally played poker, I discovered that the reality bore little resemblance to the rules. And the point being? I believe it is possible to download information from a positronic brain, but I do not believe you can preserve the essence of those experiences. There is an ineffable quality to memory which I do not believe can survive your procedure. ""Ineffable quality..."" I had rather we had done this together. But one way or the other, we are doing it. You are under my command. No, sir, I am not under yours, nor anyone else's command. I have resigned from Starfleet. Resigned? You can't resign. I regret the decision, but I must. I am the culmination of one man's dream. This is not ego or vanity, but when Dr Soong created me, he added to the substance of the universe. lf, by your experiments, I am destroyed, something unique, something wonderful will be lost. I cannot permit that. I must protect his dream. And so must I. But keep packing, because one way or the other you will be reporting. Captain's log, supplemental. Cmdr Bruce Maddox, thwarted by Data's abrupt resignation, is now seeking a legal remedy for his woes. Capt Louvois has requested my presence at those discussions. Your response is emotional and irrational. You endow Data with human attributes because it looks human. It is not. If it were a box on wheels I would not face this opposition. Overt sentimentality is not one of Capt Picard's failings, trust me. I will tell you again, Data is a valued member of my crew, an outstanding bridge officer. If I am permitted to make this experiment, our horizons become boundless. Consider, every ship in Starfleet with a Data on board. Utilizing its extraordinary capabilities, our hands and eyes in dangerous situations... You're preaching to the choir here. Get to the point. Data must not be allowed to resign. Data is a Starfleet officer with certain rights. I'm sick to death of hearing about rights! What about my right not to have my life's work subverted by ignorance? We have laws. You cannot experiment with people to prove your theories. Thank you. Now you're doing it. Data is an extraordinary piece of engineering, but it is a machine. If you permit it to resign, it will destroy years of work in robotics. Starfleet need not allow the resignation. Commander, who do you think you work for? Starfleet does not ignore its own regulations when they become inconvenient. Like it or not, Data does have rights. Let me put it another way. Would you permit the Enterprise computer to refuse a refit? That's an interesting point. But the computer is property. Is Data? Of course. There may be law to support this. Then find it. A ruling with such broad implications must be supported. I hope you will use the same zeal that you did in the Stargazer court martial. Data, you're supposed to rip the wrapping off. With the application of a little care, Wes, the paper can be utilized again. You're missing the point. The Dream of the Fire by K'Ratak. Thank you, Worf. With the Klingons, the novel attained its full stature. I couldn't disagree more. We'll save that argument for another day. Excuse me, please. Is something wrong? Of course there is. You're going away. No one regrets that necessity more than I. You do understand my reasons? Sure, I understand. I just don't like you being forced out. It's not fair. As Dr Pulaski would no doubt remind us, life is rarely fair. Sorry, that doesn't make it any better. I shall miss you, Geordi. Me, too. Take care of yourself, Data. I have completed my research, based on the Acts of Cumberland passed in the early 21st century. Data is the property of Starfleet. He cannot resign or refuse to cooperate with Cmdr Maddox. What if I challenge this ruling? Then we must hold a hearing. I so challenge. Convene a hearing. Captain, that would be difficult. This is a new base, I have no staff. But surely you have regulations to take care of such an eventuality. There are. I can use serving officers as legal counsel. You, as senior officer, would defend. Very good. The unenviable task of prosecuting would be yours, Commander, as the next most senior officer on the ship. I can't. I won't. Data is my comrade. We have served together. I not only respect him, I consider him my friend. When people of good conscience have an honest dispute, we must still sometimes resort to such an adversarial system. You want me to prove Data is a mere machine. I can't. I don't believe it. I know better. I'm neither qualified nor willing. You'll have to find someone else. Then I rule summarily based on my findings. Data is a toaster. Have him report to Cmdr Maddox for experimental refit. I see. I have no choice but to agree. Good. And I expect you to do your duty in court. If I find you are not doing your best, I will end this then and there. You don't have to remind us of our duty. You just... ..remember yours. I have never forgotten it. Not then and certainly not now. Come. Data, Capt Louvois has issued a ruling. You are the property of Starfleet Command. You cannot resign. I see. From limitless options I am reduced to none. Or rather, one. I hope Cmdr Maddox is more capable than it appears. Data, you not going to submit. We're going to fight this. I challenged the ruling. Capt Louvois will be compelled to hold a hearing. She may be overly attached to the letter of the law, but I suspect she still understands its spirit. We will put to rest any question of your legal status once and for all. I have been asked to represent you, but if you prefer another officer... Captain, I have complete confidence in your ability to represent me. Computer, identify Riker, William T. Access code, theta alpha 2737, blue, enable. Riker, William T, identified. Ready. Access all available technical schematics on Lt Cmdr Data. Working. This hearing, convened on stardate 42527.4, is to determine the legal status of the android, Data. The Judge Advocate General has rendered a finding of property, the defence has challenged. Cmdr Riker? Your Honour, there is one issue, one relevant piece of evidence. I call Lt Cmdr Data. Verify. Lt Cmdr Data. Current assignment, USS Enterprise. Starfleet Command decoration... We'll stipulate to all of this. Objection, Your Honour. I want this read. All of it. Sustained. .. Valour and Gallantry, Medal of Honour with Clusters, Legion of Honour, the Star Cross. Proceed, Commander. Commander, what are you? An android. Which is...? Webster's 24th Century Dictionary Fifth Edition defines an android as an automaton made to resemble a human being. ""Automaton."" ""Made."" By whom? Sir? Who built you, Commander? Dr Noonian Soong. He was...? The foremost cybernetics authority. More basic than that. What was he? Human? Thank you. What is your memory capacity and how fast can you access information? I have an ultimate storage capacity is 800 quadrillion bits. My total linear speed has been rated at 60 trillion operations per second. Your Honour, I offer prosecution's exhibit A, a rod of par-steel, tensile strength, 40 kilobars. Commander, can you bend that? Objection! Many life forms possess mega-strength. This is not relevant. I can't agree, Captain. Proceed with your demonstration. Drawing on the construction log of the prototype android, Lore, also made by Noonian Soong, I request to be allowed... ..to remove Data's hand for inspection. Objection! It doesn't matter. Objection withdrawn. Proceed, Commander. I'm sorry. The Commander is a physical representation of a dream, an idea conceived of by the mind of a man. Its purpose is to serve human needs and interests. It's a collection of neural nets and heuristic algorithms. Its response is dictated by elaborate software written by a man, its hardware built by a man. And now... Now a man will shut it off. Pinocchio is broken. Its strings have been cut. I request a recess. Granted. Do you mean his argument was that good? His presentation was devastating. He almost convinced me. You've got the harder argument. By his own admission, Data is a machine. That's true. You're worried about what will happen to him? I've had to send people on far more dangerous missions. Then this should work out fine. Maddox could get lucky and create an army of Datas, all very valuable. Yes, no doubt. He's proved his value to you. In ways that I cannot even begin to calculate. And now he's about to be ruled the property of Starfleet. That should increase his value. In what way? In the history of many worlds there have always been disposable creatures. They do the dirty work. Work that no one else wants to do, because it's too hard, too hazardous. With an army of Datas, all disposable, you don't have to think about their welfare, or about how they feel. Whole generations of disposable people. You're talking about slavery. I think that's a little harsh. I don't think that's harsh, I think that's the truth. A truth that we have obscured behind... ..a comfortable, easy euphemism. ""Property."" But that's not the issue at all, is it? Cmdr Riker has dramatically demonstrated to this court that Lt Cmdr Data is a machine. Do we deny that? No. Because it is not relevant. We too are machines. Just machines of a different type. Cmdr Riker has also reminded us that Lt Cmdr Data was created by a human. Do we deny that? No. Again it is not relevant. Children are made from the building blocks of their parents' DNA. Are they property? I call Lt Cmdr Data to the stand. What are these? My medals. Why do you pack them? What purpose have they? I do not know, sir. I suppose none. I just wanted them. Is that vanity? And this? A gift from you, sir. You value it? Yes, sir. Why? It is a reminder of friendship and service. And this? You have no other portraits of crew members. Why this person? I would prefer not to answer that question, sir. I gave my word. In the circumstances, I don't think Tasha would mind. She was special to me, sir. We were... ..intimate. Thank you, Commander. I have no further questions for this witness. Cmdr Riker, do you want to cross? I have no questions, Your Honour. Thank you. You may step down. I call to the stand Cmdr Bruce Maddox as a hostile witness. Verify. Maddox, Bruce, Commander. Current assignment, Associate Chair of Robotics, Technological Institute. Major papers... Yes, he's an expert. Commander, is your contention that Lt Cmdr Data is not a sentient being and thus not entitled to all the rights reserved for all life forms in this Federation? Data is not sentient, no. Would you enlighten us? What is required for sentience? Intelligence, self-awareness, consciousness. Prove to the court I am sentient. This is absurd! We all know you're sentient. So I am sentient but Cmdr Data is not? That's right. Why? Why am I sentient? Well, you are self-aware. That's your second criterion. Let's deal with the first, intelligence. Is Cmdr Data intelligent? Yes. It has the ability to learn and understand and to... ..cope with new situations. Like this hearing? Yes. What about self-awareness? What does it mean? Why am I self-aware? Because you are conscious of your existence and actions, you are aware of yourself and your own ego. Cmdr Data, what are you doing now? Taking part in a hearing to determine my rights and status. Am I a person or property? And what's at stake? My right to choose. Perhaps my very life. ""My rights."" ""My status."" ""My right to choose."" ""My life."" It seems reasonably self-aware to me. Commander? I'm waiting. This is exceedingly difficult. Do you like Cmdr Data? I don't know it well enough to... like or dislike it. But you admire him? Yes. It is an extraordinary piece of... Engineering, programming, you said. You have devoted your life to the study of cybernetics? Yes. And Cmdr Data in particular? Yes. Now you propose to dismantle him. To learn from it and make more. How many more? As many as are needed. Hundreds, thousands if necessary. There is no limit. A single Data - and forgive me, Commander - is a curiosity. A wonder, even. But thousands of Datas... Isn't that becoming... ..a race? And won't we be judged by how we treat that race? Now tell me, Commander, what is Data? I don't understand. What is he? A machine. Are you sure? Yes. He met two criteria for sentience. What if he met the third? Consciousness. What is he then? I don't know. Do you? That's the question you have to answer. A courtroom is a crucible where we burn away irrelevancies until we are left with a pure product, truth, for all time. Sooner or later, this man or others like him will succeed in replicating Cmdr Data. The decision you reach today will determine how we will regard this... ..creation of our genius. It will reveal what people are, what he is destined to be. It will reach beyond this courtroom and this one android. It could redefine the boundaries of personal liberty and freedom, expanding them for some, savagely curtailing them for others. Are you prepared to condemn him and all who come after to slavery? Your Honour, Starfleet was founded to seek out new life. Well, there it sits! Waiting. You wanted a chance to make law. Here it is. Make it a good one. It sits there looking at me, and I don't know what it is. This case has dealt with metaphysics, with questions best left to saints and philosophers. I am neither competent nor qualified to answer those. I've got to make a ruling, to try to speak to the future. Is Data a machine? Yes. Is he the property of Starfleet? No. We have all been dancing around the basic issue. Does Data have a soul? I don't know that he has. I don't know that I have. But I must give him the freedom to explore that question himself. It is the ruling of this court that Lt Cmdr Data has the freedom to choose. I formally refuse to undergo your procedure. I will cancel the transfer order. Thank you. And Commander, continue your work. When you are ready, I will still be here. I find some of what you propose... ..intriguing. He's remarkable. You didn't call him ""it"". You see? Sometimes it does work. Dinner? Are you buying? Sir, there is a celebration on the holodeck. I have no right to be there. Because you failed in your task? God, no, I was that close to a win. Yes, sir. I almost cost you your life. Is it not true that had you refused to prosecute, Capt Louvois would have ruled against me? Yes. That action injured you and saved me. I will not forget it. You're a wise man, my friend. Not yet, sir. But with your help, I am learning. "
S2E10,"Sir, we are approaching Klavdia III. Take us to impulse power. Aye, sir, impulse power. Bridge, Engineering. Yes, Lieutenant? Out of warp. I'd like to use this time to make some routine adjustments. We're overdue. How long will that take? A couple of hours, sir. Proceed, Lt La Forge. Standard orbit, Ensign. Wes, I need an SCM Model 3 from ship's stores. Can you handle that? Right away. Alright. Magnify, Mr Worf. Hardly an inviting planet, even for a research establishment. I would have thought Daled IV would send a future leader to a more hospitable environment. For some, security is more important than comfort. Yes, but 16 years. Captain, we're being hailed. Hailing frequencies, Mr Worf. Open. This is Capt Picard of the USS Enterprise. I am Anya... The troposphere is distorting our signal. Can you clean it up, Mr Worf? I'll try. Now. This is Picard of the Enterprise. Please will you repeat your message? I am Anya. Have you come for Salia of Daled IV? That is correct. What species are you? Human. Excellent. Bring us aboard. That is all. Friendly, isn't she? Friendly or not, Salia has the rank of Head of State, so let's treat them accordingly. Number One, Mr Worf, let's go greet our visitors. You have the bridge, Mr Data. Aye, sir. Welcome to the Enterprise. I'm Capt Picard. This is Salia of Daled IV. I didn't feel a thing. Is that normal when one is transported? Yes, it is. May I see your matter-energy conversion controls? Of course. I can arrange a tour of the ship. I'd love that. That will not be necessary. Just show us to our quarters, Capt Picard. Very well. Your quarters are normally reserved for Starfleet admiralty. That's a superconducting magnet, isn't it? Yeah, it's an SCM model. How did you know that? Study. For the last 16 years I've... Please, Salia, walk ahead with me. Be careful, those can rip the iron out of your blood cells. Commander, who is she? I think she's a governess. No! The girl? I don't know if she'll have time for you, Wes. She's destined to rule an entire world. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Come in. You wanted to see me? Yes. Data, the girl who came on board? Salia of Daled IV. Who is she? Little is known. She was born on Daled IV, to parents from opposite sides in a centuries-old civil war. Both died shortly after her birth. A Federation ship brought her and her governess to Klavdia III, to raise her in a neutral environment. And now she's returning? It is hoped she will unite the factions and bring peace. Ensign Crusher, report. Are you alright? Yeah, I'm fine, I just... We're waiting for that magnet! I'm on my way. Captain, we've laid in a course for Daled IV. We'll remain on impulse power until Lt La Forge finishes his adjustments. Mr Worf, did the quarters meet with our passengers' approval? I doubt anything meets with that woman's approval, sir. Captain, I'm concerned about our new passengers. Their emotions do not fit who they are and what they're doing. Do you suggest they're not who they say they are? Actually, it's more like they're not what they say they are. Picard to Salia's quarters. Yes? May we turn on the viewer? Yes, of course. Are your quarters satisfactory? Yes, very. Tell me, Captain, who was the young man I met before? That was Ensign Wesley Crusher. Thank you for checking on us. I only hope our quarters on Daled IV will be this luxurious. Please feel free to contact me at any time. Picard out. What I sensed hasn't changed. What puzzles me is how she is expected to bring peace to Daled IV. Its inhabitants have fought throughout their history. What do we know about the cause of these wars? Only that it is the difference between night and day. Data, you used a colloquialism. Did I? What I meant is that Daled IV rotates only once per revolution. So one side is constantly dark and the other is constantly light. One might surmise that the two have developed disparate cultures, which is a major cause of most wars. This child is supposed to bring them together. She seems too delicate for such a task. Do not be fooled by her looks. The body is just a shell. How can I be a leader if I don't know anything about my people? You'll lead because you were accepted by both sides. And because it is in your blood. What is expected of me there? You will know. How? You just will. Salia, you must arrive with an open mind, without preconceived ideas of what you will find, or the people on either side. It's very frustrating. You feel the weight of so much responsibility, you're not sure you'll live up to the expectations. It's not only that. Nobody even asked me if this is something I want. It is your duty. And I have no choice. It won't be as bad as you think. In fact, it could be quite wonderful. Besides, ... you are the last and only chance. Won't I need more than instinct to do whatever is expected of me on Daled IV? Energy depletion level? .04 percent and increasing. Wesley, have you found that defocused area yet? I'm looking. Yeah, I see the way you're looking. What? Sorry, I've got my mind on something. I can see that. It's this girl they beamed up. She's perfect. Absolutely perfect. Now I know why you can't concentrate. I'll do better. OK. Warning. Resonant field applied. What is it? What happened? Nothing. I had it on the wrong setting. I suppose it had to happen. It usually does at this age. What usually does? Glands erupting with hormones. It happens to all of us. Just because I said I think she's interesting? You said she was perfect. Come down. You're no use here for now. Come on down from there. Go... talk to her. Use the ladder. That's silly, Geordi. But since you recommended it, how should I approach her? What should I say? ""Hi, I'm Wesley Crusher."" ""I'd like to talk to you."" And then what? Whatever occurs to you. What if nothing does? I don't have time for this! You'll have to ask somebody else. OK. That is how the Klingon lures a mate. Are you telling me to yell at her? No. Men do not roar. Women roar. Then they hurl heavy objects. And claw at you. What does the man do? He reads love poetry. He ducks a lot. Worf, sounds like it works great for Klingons, but I think I need to try something a little less... dangerous. Then go to her door. Beg like a human. It should be that simple, Wesley. Judging by her appearance, it is likely you are biologically compatible. You may lack histocompatibility of the cell membrane, but... Data, ... I want to meet her, not dissect her. Picard to Salia's quarters. Yes, Captain? May I activate the view screen? Hurry! Go! Certainly. We've invited Anya to take a tour of the ship. Maybe you'd like to join her? Very much. Your escort will be with you shortly. Picard out. I think I'll go on the tour. Why can't I? This is the only chance I'll ever have to see a vessel like this. No. You must remain here where it is safe. Salia, do an old woman a favour and obey me for the rest of this trip. You are no more an old woman than I am a leader. Yes. Come in. I'm here to escort you on your tour. Salia will remain behind. I will be right there. You are a leader. And I... am older than you could ever imagine. What should I say? How do I act? What do I do? Guinan, could you step over here? Sounds simple enough. Your first words are the most important. You may want to start like this. You are the most beautiful woman in the galaxy. But that might not work. Yes, it would. I've longed to tell you that. But you were afraid? Of me? Of us. Of what we might become. Commander? Or that you'd think it was a line. Maybe I do think it's a line. You think I'm not sincere? I didn't say that. It's a nice line, like a knock at the door. You're inviting me in? I'm not sending you away. That's more than I expected. Is it all you hoped? To hope is to recognize the possibility. I had only dreams. Dreams can be dangerous. Not these. I dream of a galaxy where your eyes are the stars and the universe worships the night. Careful. Putting me on a pedestal, you may not be able to reach me. Then I'll learn how to fly. You are the heart in my day and the soul in my night. I don't think this is my style. Shut up, kid. Tell me more about my eyes. This is the dilithium crystal chamber. Our Chief Engineer, Geordi La Forge. What is that? What are you doing? Nothing to be concerned about. Just some routine adjustments. I wasn't aware that the deuterium control conduit required adjustment. I run periodic inspections on all engineering systems. And you've found a malfunction. It's not a malfunction. Just a minute defocused area. It lowers operating efficiency. It may also produce excess prions. Our computer would detect that. Unless, of course, it too is malfunctioning. Look, I really have to get this finished. Please come with me. I will be back to check your progress. Ensign Crusher, what can I do for you? Nothing. Is there a problem? No. Can you show me how to work the food dispenser? Sure. Really, it's quite simple. You tell the computer what you want and it prepares it for you. What should I order? I don't know. What do you like? I'd like something sweet. I know. Computer, Thalian chocolate mousse. It's a wonderful sensation. On Thalos VII, they age the beans 400 years. You've been there? It's one of my favourite places. It must be fun to visit a planet like that. It's the best part of being on the Enterprise. I've studied about some of them. But to see them would be wonderful. Tell me about the other places you've been. There's too many. The only world I've known is Klavdia III. It's about time we changed that. How? Come with me. I'll be with you in a moment. What's wrong with him? Andronesian encephalitis. That disease is contagious! Very unlikely. Our air-filtering system... But there is a chance! If you mean mathematically, yes, the probability is not zero. I cannot rely on your primitive technologies! Kill the patient. What? Destroy the patient. Immediately! Now, you calm down. If you won't take action, then I will! Security to sickbay! Hurry! Wait! Hold your fire! Worf! What is she? Keep her away. Do not interfere. She wants to kill Hennesey. His disease threatens Salia. Captain, there is no chance of contagion. The situation is under control. That's not good enough! Well, it will have to be. Your powers are infinitesimal compared to mine. Yes, that may be, but you will obey my orders. You will remain in your quarters, and in your present form, for the rest of this voyage. Is that clear? Very! Keep her under guard. Aye, sir. Wait for me. What kind of creature is she? I've never seen anything like her. There is mention in the galactic zoological catalogue of a species called allasomorph, which possess the power to alter their molecular structure into other life forms. Such a creature would make a perfect protector. I want a Security team stationed outside sickbay. Aye, sir. Captain, what if Anya transforms? Improvise. Can a place so remarkable truly exist? Yes. There are many more. All of them are different. I've learned about them. That's all I did on Klavdia III was learn. I know so much, ... but I've seen so little. Think of all you have to look forward to. This is a great time to be alive. For you. For both of us. This is all just beginning. We've only charted 19% of our galaxy. The rest is out there just waiting. Look what we've already discovered. I have never seen anything so wondrous. Wait. Computer, Rousseau V. It's breathtaking! And you've been to this place? Someday, you'll visit Rousseau V, and many other places, all more spectacular. If only it were possible. Listen. What is it? In a moment, the resonance from the neutrino clouds will become synchronous. It's so beautiful! It's like this place has a voice and is trying to speak to us. Thank you for sharing all this with me. Someday, you'll see it for yourself. Look over there. Remain here. You are restricted to quarters for the remainder of this voyage. You are the protector of this ship, are you not? I am in charge of Security. You must understand my duties as well. If you confine me to this cell, I cannot protect Salia. There is no need for concern. She is safe on this ship. You must understand that I cannot make such an assumption. You haven't any choice. You must trust me to protect her. No! A protector cannot have two charges. Your responsibility is to the ship. My duty is to Salia. My responsibility to the ship includes protecting Salia. You know I'm stronger than you. I was unprepared. You underestimated me in your sickbay. That is usually fatal. Still, you are here, confined to your room. I ceased my struggle by choice, not because of you or your Captain. I would have stopped you. If not me, someone else. No. You cannot control me. We will see. We've brought a very dangerous life form on board. I want to minimize the chance of any incident. Whatever life form Anya is, emotionally she's Salia's mother. The most dangerous animal is a mother protecting her young. Exactly. Captain, this is Anya. Yes? Salia is gone. Where is she? This has all been so wonderful. I'm not even sure it's real. Believe me, ten-forward isn't an illusion. Not that. I mean the way I feel. You won't find a better dish of chocolate anywhere. I'm sure I won't. Is something wrong? I've had a great time being with you, Wesley. And that makes you sad? When I was on Klavdia III, all I could think about was leaving that isolation. It makes me sad having to face it again after seeing what else is possible. Is that what awaits you on Daled IV? Isolation? I thought you were going there to reunite two warring parties. What else do you know? Very little. The ship's computer doesn't have that much on Daled IV. How will you stop the fighting? I'm not certain. I only know I will have many responsibilities. Your language has no word for the position I'll hold. In many ways, I'll have even less freedom than on Klavdia III. You could stay. On the Enterprise? Why not? Because I can't. Just because a girl runs out doesn't mean she doesn't wish you to follow. What is it? What happened? Stay away from me! I'm sorry. I don't understand. I can't stay here! I can't have this life! I want it more than anything, but I can't have it! Salia, nothing is impossible. Not for you. There's a way! I know there is! Leave her alone! Ensign, step away from her. Come with me. Energy depletion level? Zero. La Forge to bridge. Yes, Lieutenant? I've completed my final adjustments. Thanks for the time. Warp engines are now available. Very good. Number One, get us to Daled as quickly as possible. Ensign Gibson, go to warp 8.8. Warp 8.8, sir. Estimated time? Three hours, nine minutes. Crusher, when you're done in Engineering, report to my ready room. Yes, sir. Take the bridge, Number One. Aye, sir. The woman, Anya, is not what she appears to be. She is... an allasomorph. A shape-shifter? She's not only a governess, she's also the girl's... protector. Now, I don't care to interfere in the personal relationships of those under my command. But in this case... You want me to stay away from Salia? Yes, I do. For the good of the ship and the safety of everyone on board. I will do as you ask. Why won't you let me have a friend? It is my duty to protect you from danger. There's no danger here. There is always danger from one who is not your kind. Salia, he's confusing you. Remember your responsibilities. Whether or not I see Wesley is for me to decide. It is not! I raised you, I protected you, and I intend to deliver you to Daled IV! Maybe what you want doesn't matter any more. Salia, please. I know it's difficult for you. But you must do what you're destined to do. Standard orbit. Aye, sir. Hailing frequencies, Mr Worf. Captain, I'm encountering the same interference as on Klavdia III. The troposphere must be distorting our signals. It is fascinating, Captain. Klavdia III and Daled IV have almost identical atmospheres. Magnify. Times 20. How could anyone exist in an environment so totally hostile toward human life? Mr Data, override the interference. Let's complete our mission. Come in. You shouldn't have come. You want me to leave? I didn't say that. Then you want me to stay. Does Anya know you're here? That doesn't matter. I'm glad you came. I thought Anya would keep you with her. I have certain rights. So you slipped out. While she was asleep. I hope you didn't get trouble from your Captain. No, I haven't gotten in trouble yet. Anya thought you would corrupt me. With my wild way of life? Maybe. With the normal things people do... when they like each other. Wesley, get out of here! What's going on? Just go! Security, crew quarters! You should not have disobeyed me. I had to. I warned you to leave her alone. Captain's log, stardate 42568.8. Since Anya's powers enabled her to escape her guards unnoticed, we have sealed her quarters with a force field that will contain her no matter how small a form she may take. I'm receiving an audio signal. Audio on. Enterprise, this is command headquarters of Daled IV. We have been expecting you. Sir, the communication originated from a terawatt source on the planet. That's more power than our entire ship could generate. It is needed to penetrate the atmosphere. Which means we lack the ability to respond, sir. Sir, beam-down coordinates are encoded in the carrier signal. Splendid. I'll arrange for our guests to beam down. Force field off. Come in. We have arrived. Salia will be with you in just a moment. You're not going? No. My duties have been completed. I have done all that I could. I hope it was enough. You've raised me well, and I thank you for that. I would not have harmed the boy. I only wanted to frighten him. I know. You are ready for what awaits you and you will do well. I know I've been hard on you, but I wanted to prepare you for anything you might have to do. Will I ever be able to leave Daled IV? Probably not. But anything is possible. That's what Wes said. I hope he's right. Where will you go? The third moon is within range of these transporters. I'll go there. It was my home before we went away. I'm going to miss you. I know. I am ready now. I will escort you to transporter room six. You will be happy to see me leave. No. You are a worthy opponent. Thank you. At heart, we are very much alike. Yes, we are. Perhaps we shall fight again. On the same side. It would be an honour. Shall we go? Come in. Wesley, I have to go now. Was it fun? What do you mean? Playing humanoid. Was it fun? Wesley, look at me. Right now, this minute, this is what I am. A humanoid girl. What are you really? Does it matter? Yes! Our natural state is unlike anything you can imagine. So, you took this form for our benefit? That's why you asked what species we are. I'm sorry I hurt you. I didn't mean to. I loved you. I love you, too! Can you? Yes! I have the same feelings, the same emotions as you. You must believe me! Please go. Wesley, let's not say goodbye like this. Prepare to beam Salia to the specified coordinates. Our world is grateful for the courtesy you have extended. I hope someday the Federation and Daled IV will have formal contact. That is my wish as well. Coordinates input, sir. Proceed. Wait. A taste to remember me by. I wish there was something I could give you. You already have. I'm glad you came to say goodbye. Thank you, for everything. I want you to leave now. Why? I cannot arrive on my planet in this form. And I want you to remember me as I am now. Don't worry, I will. Energize. Seeing her on the transporter pad, it was like seeing pure light. I miss her. I feel... empty. I know that sensation. But there'll come a time when all you remember is the love. I'm never going to feel this way about anyone else. You're right. I didn't expect you to say that. There'll be others. But every time you feel love, it'll be different. Every time, it's different. Knowing that doesn't make it any easier. It's not supposed to. "
S2E11,"Captain's log, stardate 42609.1. In response to a desperate plea from my old friend Capt Donald Varley of the USS Yamato, I'm running a grave risk by taking the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone. Dangerous malfunctions have been plaguing our sister ship. Perhaps if both crews work together, we can eliminate the problems before our presence is detected by the Romulans. How long to rendezvous, Mr Crusher? Four minutes and 33 seconds, sir. Status of download, Mr Data? The Yamato log should be in our computer by rendezvous. Have you nailed down our hiccup? Sir? The odd reading? No, sir. It might be due to problems being experienced by the Yamato. Trouble, Number One? I'm not sure. Are we alone out here, Worf? Yes. There are no other vessels except the Yamato, which is coming into visual range now. At last. Transmission from the Yamato, sir. On viewer. What's a nice Captain doing in a place like this? It's good to see you again, despite your antique humour. I hope your people can help us. Malfunctions are becoming serious. We lost an Engineering team when a computer shut down a force field in a shuttle bay. 18 people. Any idea what caused this, sir? None. They affect every system simultaneously. It's like the ship decided to fall apart. Maybe we should have run these Galaxy-class ships across more drawing boards before we built one. You believe it's a design flaw? I don't know. I'm grasping at straws. We must fix it before I lose more than an Engineering team. Do you wish to evacuate any nonessential personnel, sir? No. That would be premature. We'll get our teams to work on it immediately. I'm not comfortable sitting around in the Neutral Zone. I know you're wondering what the hell I'm doing here. Well, I heard rumours about a couple of archaeological digs that made the Iconians sound a lot less like legend. I did a little investigating and I located their home world. In the Neutral Zone? In the Neutral Zone. That was quite a risk to run to satisfy archaeological curiosity! The risk would be in allowing the Romulans to locate Iconia. Fortunately, I got there first. It's a virtually dead planet. Enough technology remains to give the Romulans an edge if they find... Your transmission is breaking up. Mr Data, try and clean that up. Sir, there is an energy build-up in the Yamato's Engineering section. Yamato, this is the Enterprise. Yamato, come in. Magnetic seals in the antimatter chamber are decaying! Captain! Donald, come in! Shields up. Sir. Sensors indicate... no life reading, sir. Captain, another vessel is coming within sensor range. It is Romulan. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, supplemental. The Yamato's entire crew and their families, more than 1,000 people, have been lost. Circumstances unfortunately permit us no pause for grief. No response from the Romulan vessel. Arm phasers and prepare to lock on target. Did they attack the Yamato? Unknown, sir. Their weapon systems have been fully activated. Still no response. Romulan vessel, this is Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. Capt Picard. Explain your illegal presence in the Neutral Zone! Explain yours. Are you responsible for the destruction of the Yamato? No. But believe me, had we exercised our right to defend the Neutral Zone, we would not have stopped with one starship. You will leave at once. Mute. Comments. She's extremely anxious. She just destroyed a starship. Your scan was inconclusive. We don't know what happened. Our presence here is provocative. It could force her to respond. Open. We will comply when I know the cause of the destruction of the Yamato, and I am satisfied you were not responsible. Picard out. Their cloaking device is engaged. Good. They can't fire. Unless they have overcome that deficiency. The Yamato was destroyed while they were cloaked. Enough. I want answers, not conjecture. Number One, I want them at a meeting in one hour. Aye, sir. Sensors reveal that what we saw was an uncontrolled and catastrophic matter/antimatter mix. The magnetic seals between the chambers collapsed and... Wait! That's not possible. It is, but a highly improbable set of circumstances has to take place. Explain. OK. In the event of a breach of seal integrity, there's a release system which dumps the antimatter. Such a dump began, was halted, and the containment seals were dropped. There was enough antimatter present to lead to an explosion. There is no evidence of weapon use? No, sir, none. However it happened, the Yamato did it to herself. Theorize. What could have caused such a catastrophic malfunction? Capt Varley may have been right. There may be a design flaw. In a Galaxy-class starship? Yes, sir. It's the most sophisticated machine ever built. Maybe something was overlooked. Knowing where the flaw is located, can you isolate it and solve it? We're already working on it, sir. Pull any personnel you can use. If we have established that the Romulans were not behind the destruction of the Yamato, would it not be prudent to withdraw? If it is a design flaw, we're better to stay where we are and give Geordi time to work on it. Or what happened to the Yamato could happen to us. Computer, access Capt Donald Varley's personal log. Search parameter. Locate entries containing words Romulan and/or Iconian. Working. Personal log. It was kind of Dr Ramsey to allow me to take my own piece of legend from the archaeological dig at Denius III. My engineers have examined it, but are completely baffled by its technology. What was its purpose? I'm like a caveman confronted by a tricorder. I'm certain this device is Iconian, but how far had it travelled before it was abandoned on this alien world? Personal log. A galactic Rosetta stone. The star fields on the artifact were unintelligible until I took into account 200 millennia of stellar drift. After that, it was easy to pinpoint Iconia. My First Officer is questioning my order to violate the Neutral Zone. But I'm convinced I've taken the only proper course. Should this technology fall into the hands of the Romulans we might as well dock our ships and defend ourselves with sticks. Personal log. We've been spotted by a Romulan cruiser. After playing hide-and-seek through several solar systems, I think I've managed to elude them. The Iconian probe scan. Was it an attempt at communication? If only I knew what we were dealing with here. Personal log. I can't send a team to the surface of Iconia or scan its energy source because of these maddening systems failures. It's infuriating to be stopped at the threshold of a dream by my own ship. We're leaving orbit to rendezvous with Picard. If he can't help us repair the Yamato, I must convince him to continue this exploration. The future wellbeing of the Federation may well depend on it. No further entries conforming to search parameters. Mr Data. There's a reference in Varley's log to a probe that scanned the Yamato. Aye, sir. We have a visual record. Put it on main viewer. What the devil is that? Have you seen anything like that before? No, sir. It appears to be a scanner, possibly a transmitter. Transmitting what? Unknown, sir. Engineering. La Forge. Any progress on the matter&antimatter scan? Everything continues to check out. Now analyzing the magnetic coils. When the Yamato was probed, where was she? In orbit around a planet at coordinates 227, mark 359. ETA at warp factor eight? 12 hours, 16 minutes, sir. Sir. That would put us close to the Romulan side of the Neutral Zone. Can't be helped. Lay in a course. Warp factor eight. Aye, sir. We'll assume the Yamato's mission. And risk a war? Perhaps... prevent one. Come. Sir, may I speak with you a moment? Yes, of course. Well, what is it, Wesley? It's about the Iconians, sir. I was told they were just a myth. China was thought to be a myth until Marco Polo went there. The Iconians are certainly real. Sit down. We know that three systems within this sector had several cultural similarities which could only be explained by there being a unifying influence. So they colonized those worlds? Probably conquered. You mean they were warlike? Perhaps. Ancient texts did speak of ""Demons of Air and Darkness"". Air and darkness? Legend has it that they travelled without the benefit of spaceships, merely appearing out of thin air on distant planets. Sounds like magic! Well, we would appear magical to Stone Age people. How did you find this out? Archaeology has been a hobby of mine since Academy days. But why don't we talk about what really brought you here? It's the Yamato, Captain. I can't stop thinking about her. All those people, ... ..dead! I don't know how you and Cmdr Riker and Geordi, how you handle it so easily. Easily? No, not easily. We handle it because we're trained to, ... ..as you will be. Tea, Earl Grey, hot. But... if ever the time comes when the death of a single individual fails to move us... Didn't you order tea, sir? Now that should not have happened. Captain's log, supplemental. As happened to our sister ship, the Enterprise is experiencing a series of system failures. So far they are random, but they could be early symptoms of what happened to the Yamato. Engineering. La Forge. Any progress on solving our problems? No, but I can eliminate one worry. It is not a design flaw. Reviewing the Yamato logs, I think that probe had something to do with their problems. How? I need to see the thing. If it was the probe, that explains the Yamato. But how do you explain the Enterprise's difficulties? I can't. Are our problems likely to attain the seriousness of the Yamato's? If you're asking for speculation, I'd say yes. I need time. Mr La Forge, time is one thing we do not have in abundance. Analysis, Mr Data. Scanning, sir. Well, Mr Data? No life-form readings, sir. All major cities have been damaged. The destruction is consistent with large-scale orbital bombardment. How long ago? Approximately 200,000 years, sir. There is an energy source in the smaller continent's mountains. Magnify. Is that Iconia? Capt Varley died believing that it was. Did you see that? Projectile launched from the planet surface! Its size and composition match the probe which scanned the Yamato. Shields up. Prepare a tractor beam. Mr La Forge, I'm going to assist you in your research. A probe has been launched from Iconia. I'm going to capture it. No, sir! Wait! Captain! Bridge! Emergency! Stop! Stop! Damn it! Tractor beam ready, sir. Geordi, are you alright? Destroy the probe, sir! Quickly! Worf, target phasers. Phasers locked on target. Fire! Welcome to the bridge, Mr La Forge. Thank you, sir. If that thing had managed to scan us, we'd have had no chance of saving the Enterprise. That probe was transmitting an alien computer program. That program is now on the Enterprise trying to rewrite our software. We have two completely incompatible computer systems trying to interact. That's why our instruments are so erratic? Yes. What can you do? Not much. The Iconian program is so sophisticated, I may never crack it. Consider, Captain, this program has entered an alien database, ours. In less than seven hours it has learned our systems and begun to reprogram our computer. The earlier probe was responsible for the Yamato's destruction? Yes. Only in as much as it was the probe that transmitted the program. We weren't scanned by that probe. How did it get aboard the Enterprise? We downloaded the Yamato log, and in that log was the program. Why didn't we suffer the same fate? The program affected the Yamato's systems simultaneously. Here, it was deposited within a specific section of our mainframe. It has to work its way out. It gives us some breathing space. Not much. Injury reports are increasing, too, sir. Dr Pulaski does not trust the turbo lifts. She is sending her teams through access tunnels. The Enterprise computer is a lot like our own bodies, with voluntary and involuntary systems. 90 percent of what goes on in this ship is done automatically. Completely out of our control. We're sitting on a bomb that could go off any second. Or maybe never. The biobeds aren't working? The ship is falling apart! I've had 35 emergency calls scattered across 12 decks. My trauma teams are being run ragged trying to respond. Biobeds! Dr Pulaski? Yes? I've got a problem here. The knitter isn't working. Try a splint. Doctor? Splint. It's an ancient concept. You take two flat pieces of wood, or plastic, a bandage. The broken limb is kept immobile. That's not practising medicine. Yes, it is. It's a time-honoured way. With your head, your heart and your hands. So jump to it. Damn. Try a bypass on the shield-control interface. No go. Let me see if I can directly access the master program. What happened? Any answer would be speculation. This is yet another example of how our actions have random results. Thanks, Data. I noticed. Life support has failed on decks seven and 13, sir. What if this thing can rewrite our entire system? It's so far beyond our understanding, never mind our control. Our own ignorance could kill us. We may never... We may never reach that point. A variation of what happened to the Yamato may destroy us first. So, we sit and watch our ship disintegrate around us? The probe was launched from Iconia. Probably from an automated system. There may be records near the launch site that could help us find a solution. I'll arrange an away team. And I'll lead it. You will lead it? Yes. We've had this conversation a hundred times. And we will have it again. I have studied the Iconians. I have to go. The Enterprise is yours. For as long as she lasts. I've got a lock on the energy source and it's working. But that could change. We're aware of the risks. Energize. Transport complete. Stay sharp. I want to be able to pull them out at a moment's notice. Aye, sir. Commander, Romulan vessel. Open hailing frequencies. They're arming torpedoes! Shields up! Go to red alert. The shields aren't responding! They're preparing to fire! Mr Crusher, I need those shields! I'm trying, sir! They're firing! What happened? Instead of firing, they disarmed and cancelled. Fate... ..protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Lock phasers on them and hold your fire. Sir, the shields are back up. Impeccable timing. Sir, the shields are back down. Phaser banks are down. Shields are back up. Another time and place, this could be funny. Status of torpedo banks? They're down, too. If we have to fight, could you find me some rocks to throw? Sir, the Romulan torpedoes are continuing to arm and disarm. Perhaps its attempt to fire was unintentional. Open hailing frequencies. Open. Romulan vessel, this is Cmdr William Riker of the USS Enterprise. Why did you attempt to fire on us? This is Subcommander Taris of the Haakona. Why have you penetrated deeper into the Neutral Zone? Why are you still here? I have claimed this planet for the Romulan Empire. This is the Neutral Zone. No one can claim anything. Withdraw or I'll have to destroy your ship and your away team! What the hell...? This is your final warning. I will not... Trouble with your systems, Commander? Maybe we should consider postponing the war... ..until we solve our more immediate problem. You're stalling for time. Sir, another probe launched. Heading for the Romulans. Have we got our phasers back? No, sir. Taris, if you have phaser capability, prepare to use them now! What? Destroy that probe! And not even a thank you. She is frustrated, probably because her ship is as crippled as ours. Why would the Romulans be having problems? They weren't probed. They must have tapped into the Yamato log. Taris got more than she bargained for. Maintain red alert. Try to keep our shields up in case Taris decides to act on her threat. Commander. What about the away team? With the shields up, we can't beam them back. Captain's log, supplemental. There is little left on the surface of Iconia, but we have found a control centre which seems to have remained intact. Come in, Enterprise. Still no response, sir. Keep trying. Communications are bound to be erratic. I would not like to become a permanent resident of this planet. Nor would l, Mr Worf. Scanners show no other life forms on the planet, sir. I would not expect any. Judging from the severity of the bombardment, I doubt any Iconians survived. Mr Data, let's see what sense we can make of this. Aye, sir. This is reminiscent of Dinasian. Yes, sir. There are also similarities to Dewan and Iccobar. Is it possible they form one language family, beginning with Iconian? It is, sir. Run a comparison using basic words from Dinasian, Dewan and Iccobar. See if we can reconstruct a common root language. Accessing, sir. You're jumpy. The tension on the ship is very high. Any recommendation? Give everyone something to do, to focus their attention. Alright. Let's consider evacuation. For the planet? I know it's probably impossible with Taris sitting out there, but it would give everyone something to do. You go and organise it. You may need me if you have to negotiate with Taris. I'll manage. Right now, they're more important. Captain. Your original hypothesis is correct. Iconian is the parent tongue of a language family consisting of Iccobar, Dewan and Dinasian. I've constructed an understanding through a comparison of root words, such as mother, father, child, home, tribe, food, life, death, yours... You know my interpretation of the signals will not be exact? Yes. Let's get on with it. This appears to be manual override. That was not manual override. Demons of Air and Darkness indeed. What is that? A gateway? These scenes could be holographic images. Be careful! That was very foolish. But proves this is not a holograph. If I stepped through, we could see if this is truly a gateway. No, Data. You might not get back. I can't risk losing you. This gate would seem to take us beyond the confines of this planet. Is this how the Iconians travelled? Crossing light years as easily as we would cross a room? Those places could be on worlds in distant corners of the galaxy. I think the Iconians might have outfoxed their enemies. Maybe they didn't all die in the bombardment. Some of them could have passed through this. This is what Varley feared. This is what he died for. Sir? The Romulans could use this technology as a weapon. Like the Iconians did. No, I disagree. Captain, nothing here indicates this was a military command centre. Perhaps a transporter room? The probe was hostile. We can't make that assumption. It devastated the Yamato, but what if it was by accident not design? What I'm going to say may sound unscientific, but... standing on this soil, breathing in this air, my instincts say we may have got them wrong. We do know the Iconians were conquerors. Only according to descendants of those who attacked this world. The victors invariably write history to their advantage. It is an unfortunate tendency in many cultures to fear what they do not understand. It's possible that their enemies, confronted by this technology, may have attacked the Iconians out of fear. Sir! Was that really the Enterprise? I believe that it was. Gentlemen, we have a way home. Captain, there is a vast underground power source which is controlled by this console. I believe my triggering of the gateway has caused an upsurge in the power level. I have access. Data, can you hear me? Data, respond. Captain... Are you alright? No... I am... damaged. How bad is it? The Iconian program is attempting to rewrite my software. Physical manifestations, blindness, motor cont... Sir, without him we have no hope of deciphering the program. Captain. The Enterprise again. How long is the interval? About four minutes. If the cycle holds. Next time the Enterprise appears, go through it with Data. Geordi can learn from him. Maybe help him. We don't know if that is a gateway. This will be the test. Aye, sir. Destroy the tricorder. It contains everything we've discovered up to this point. Precisely why it must be destroyed. How long? About three minutes. I'm running out of time. We all are. Data. I have to destroy this. This control room must not be allowed to fall into Romulan hands. I... understand, sir. How? How do I do it? How do I destroy everything? The control room, the probes, all of it! The... power source, sir. I detonate it. But how? How do I do that? The... probes, sir. Probes? The probes? Launch? I launch the probes? But... why? What good will that do? The... doors, sir. Doors? Perhaps the probes are in a launch bay. If the doors are closed, the backwash from the rockets will overload the power bridge. Yes, ... sir. The doors open automatically when the launch begins. And I will override. Correct, sir. Which control keys? Damn. You can't see. Help. Worf, help him up. Describe, please. I'm in front of the gate. To my left there is a small triangular screen. Right. One... meter. Right. To my right is a larger screen. The top is solid amber. The left, red... Correct. Key, ... blue, ... amber, amber, ... red. That's the launch sequence? How do I override the doors? Blue, blue, blue. I hope that's not a stutter. I don't know what the delay is between launch and detonation. I won't key the launch sequence until you're through the gate. How long until the Enterprise reappears? Almost time. Captain, ... ..you will be killed. I'll go through the gate. But where will you end up? Very shortly, anywhere will be preferable to this room. Mr Worf, I am depending on you to get Data back to the Enterprise. He may be their only hope. Aye, sir. Commander, look. What happened? Where's the Captain? We must take Data to Engineering. Hopefully the Captain will follow. I don't know how to help him. Comparing recorded norms to these current readings shows all his functions are just going crazy! If we had an expert, a Maddox, somebody... He's gone. What the hell...? I am accessing. The self-correcting mechanism. Captain? It's kicking in to make minute adjustments in the positronic brain. I am on the Enterprise! How did I get here? He cleared the Iconian program from his system. How? I was on Iconia, now I am on the Enterprise. This is critical. How? Give me a second to think. There was an incompatible program in Data's system. The mechanism looked for a way to keep him alive. The solution... The solution was a shutdown and a total wipe of affected memory. Inquiry. What have I forgotten? Can you do it with the Enterprise? I don't see why not. But it must be a complete shutdown to effect a wipe of the Yamato log, including every event since we downloaded it. I'll reload the ship's programs from the archives in the core. Geordi, if we shut down, it means we'll be bringing down the shields. We're hanging nose to nose with the Romulans! Whether it's Romulan phasers or our own warp engines, we're just as dead. Make it so. May I help? All systems functioning. Lock on the Captain, get him back. Scanning, sir. Got him! I've lost him. Damn it! Got him, sir. On the Romulan ship! How the hell...? Go to your stations. You did this! You sabotaged my ship! No. I cannot deactivate the auto-destruct, but at least I have the satisfaction that you will die with us. Not, I think, today, Commander. Bridge, Picard. Take us out of here. The Romulan vessel is set to auto-destruct. Wait! Open hailing frequencies. Cmdr Taris, our Chief Engineer will transmit how to purge your system. Agreed, Enterprise. Standing by. Commander, your transmission has been received and acknowledged. Now, Mr Data, warp speed, please. In case Taris's engineer is not as efficient as La Forge. Aye, sir. Well, Number One, I see why you keep the away missions to yourself. That's where the excitement is. What's been happening here? Same old routine, I suppose? "
S2E12,"Captain's log, stardate 42625.4. We are entering orbit around the eighth planet in this previously unmapped Theta 116 solar system. We diverted from our course when a passing Klingon cruiser reported discovering pieces of a strange vessel in the upper atmosphere of this planet. We have come to investigate. Nasty. Nitrogen, methane, liquid neon. Surface temperature, minus 291 degrees Celsius. Winds up to 312 meters per second. Not exactly a vacation planet. Unless you like ammonia tornadoes. But I have found indications of debris in an elliptical orbit. Keep me informed. The sooner we know what the Klingons saw, the sooner we can get out of here. Sounds good to me. Nasty! Come. Fermat's last theorem. You're familiar with it? Vaguely. I spent too many math classes daydreaming about starships. When Pierre de Fermat died, they found this equation scrawled in the margin of his notes. X to the nth plus Y to the nth equals Z to the nth, where n is greater than two, which had no solution in whole numbers. But... he also added this phrase. ""Remarkable proof."" It's coming back to me. There was no proof included. For 800 years, people have been trying to solve it. Including you. I find it stimulating. Also, it puts things in perspective. In our arrogance, we feel we are so advanced, and yet we cannot unravel a simple knot tied by a part-time French mathematician, working alone, without a computer. Captain, we've found some debris in a loose orbit. Can you identify it? No. We could beam a section aboard for analysis. Make it so, Number One. We've locked onto something with markings. Of what sort? Uncertain. Energize. We've got ourselves a puzzle, Number One. Sir, I guess we have. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Analysis shows that the object was terrestrial in origin, dated mid-21st century. No, no Earth ship of that time could have travelled out this far. That is what our tests indicate, and the markings are consistent with this hypothesis. Any indication of what destroyed it, Data? That is more significant than the object itself. On several surfaces, the molecules have disintegrated. Disintegrated? How? Almost as if they were hit by a weapon from our time. Curiouser and curiouser. Captain, we've detected a large structure on the planet. It's a building of some sort, stood on a plane of frozen methane, smack in the middle of a storm belt. Incredible. It's surrounded by breathable air. Is there any connection with that ship fragment we found? Unknown, sir. Suggestions? Just one. We could go down and have a look. Breathable air. No life forms that might be dangerous. I think we could risk a minimal away team, Number One. Give me a moment, gents. This is an extremely narrow access point. Phasers on stun. Ready when you are. We've got it. You have a green light, Commander. Energize. Those ammonia storms are less than a kilometer away, yet they do not penetrate this breathable zone. It's like the eye of a hurricane. Commander, what is that? A door. The structure must be here, yet... we cannot see it. Enterprise, this is Cmdr Riker. As your read-out shows, this is an unusual place. Completely calm, no sound, no movement, yet a few hundred meters away, a storm is raging. Any information about the structure? There is an antique revolving door. Could be an entrance. A revolving door? Number One, proceed with caution. Yes, sir. Well, this is what we came here for. Captain, we're entering. Enterprise to away team, come in. We're receiving no signal at all from them, sir. Transporter room, lock on to them. Beam them up. We've nothing to lock on to, sir. Riker to Enterprise, we've entered the structure. Riker to Enterprise, come in. Come in, Enterprise. When they went through that door the signal disappeared, sir. What's causing the interference? Unknown. Are they receiving us? No. We'll have to recalibrate all the frequencies to find one that works. Then do it. Sir, without communication we should beam up immediately. We're here, there's no danger. We'll look around, then leave. Checking in, gentlemen? Use the front desk. Very good. We'll start with that. Welcome, gentlemen. Have a nice trip? Do you know us? We've been expecting you. A trio of foreign gentlemen. We're from the United Federation of Planets. Of course you are. Welcome to the Hotel Royale. Excuse me. Did Rita call? I'm busy. You're busy? This is my life I'm talking about. Now did Rita call or not? No. And for your own good you'd better quit thinking about Rita. I'm not afraid of Mickey D. Then you're a fool. Anybody with any sense is afraid of Mickey D. If Rita calls, you let me know. Kid's asking for trouble. Rita's too much for him to handle and Mickey D will plant his face in the pavement. Now, here are your room keys. And some complimentary casino chips. Enjoy. What is this place? How did a being like you get here? Why, this is the Royale, of course. And my personal life is none of your business, thank you. He means what planet is this? I beg your pardon? This planet, what do you call it? Earth. What do you call it? We call it Theta VIII. How charming. Commander. Yes, Data? None of these people are emitting life signs. You mean they're not alive? Then what are they? These beings, ... are they machines? Or mere illusions designed to deceive us? Not illusion, Lieutenant. They do exist. But they do not register as either man or machine. Take this creature, for example. He does not exhibit any DNA structure. Excuse me, son. Look who's talking. Man, you sound just like my ex-wife. Alright... Time to get down to business. What sort of business do you suppose he is getting down to? Status report. We're trying alternate encoding schemes. There could be hundreds of combinations. Is there an intelligence causing this interference? That's impossible to tell, Captain. It's unlike Cmdr Riker not to follow procedure. When he lost contact with us, he should have returned to the beam-down coordinates. I don't feel he's in any danger. In fact, if I could choose one word to assess his mood, it would be ""amused"". Amused? Put some chips there, mister. Yes, sirree! You're new here, aren't you? Yes, sir. Sit down. I'm gonna teach you how this game is played, boy. Go ahead. Ante up. He wants you to cut the cards. Is this poker? No, blackjack. Blackjack? Accessing. Also known as 21, the number which defines the object of the game. Picture cards are worth ten, aces one or eleven, all other cards face value. Boy, you're right. Pretty smooth. Run 'em, boy. Make 'em nice. 21, 21 ... Don't look at your hand, honey. That gal has got to win. Now honey, you got 15 and the dealer's showing ten. Do I hit, Texas, or do I stand? If you've gotta win, you've gotta hit. Hit me. Damn. Shoot... Hit me. 21 . And a winner. Yes, sirree! Hit me. Another. Do you think you've had enough? If the objective of the game is to approach a total of 21 points, I definitely need another card. Yeah. You have got the brass! Do you know the odds on a five-card charlie? Hell, you're just throwing your money away. Hit me. How'd you...? Shut my mouth! Are you one of them card-counting fellas? The number of the cards and their values remain constant. Where is the purpose in counting them? Yeah. Having fun, Data? Fun, sir? There is a certain amount of enjoyment but I'm researching... Save it. Let's get out of here. Yes, sir. You're holding up the game. Our apologies. I'll watch your chips. Thank you, sir. The hat. Sorry, sir. Deal 'em up. Progress? We've accessed the range of alternates. The problem is the frequency range. Interference is highly variable. It may be due to the envelope over the structure, causing hydrogen-carbon helix patterns throughout. So transmissions are scattered and refracted at random. No wonder you can't get through. Exactly. Those are fairly aggressive computations. I'm comparing the molecular integrity of that bubble against our phasers. Is penetration possible? I don't know. It may be an option. I'd like to run this test. Make it so. Let's try that again. Let's find another way out of here. Excuse me... Excuse me. Aside from the main door, is there another exit I might use? Excuse...? Excuse me... Say, I was wondering if you could tell me... There's a good deal of structural integrity, Worf. Permission to use phaser, sir. Granted. Sir, I can find no other exits. I believe we are trapped here. Captain's log, supplemental. We remain in orbit around Theta VIII, still out of contact with the away team. We're almost there, Captain. We can attempt contact in a few minutes. Captain, the situation down there has changed. In what way? Cmdr Riker... has become tense. Closed in, he's feeling trapped. Phasers are ineffective on all surfaces. Our options appear limited. We don't have any. We're going to have to get out on our own. I want some answers from that desk clerk. Are you crazy? Wrong. I'm finally gettin' some smarts. You won't scare Mickey D with that gun. I'll make him leave Rita alone. Kid, she's a big girl. And she's Mickey D's girl. Not any more. Not after tonight. Look, kid, I don't wanna see you get hurt, especially over some dame. Don't call her that. You'll see. You'll see how tough Mickey D is. He's nothin'. I want some answers. The concierge... I want to get out of here. The exits are clearly marked. That's not good enough. If you have a complaint, you can always take it up with the manager. Fine. I'd like to see him. Now. I'm afraid the manager is very busy. Riker, can you read me? Yes. There's a good deal of interference, but you are getting through. Why haven't you left that building? We tried, sir. We're trapped. We're in no immediate danger but I am concerned. Your location is interfering with communication. We are working on it. Standing by, sir. These frequencies are unstable. Then find others. What is going on down there? Commander. I am picking up something unusual in another area of this structure. It appears to be human DNA. Where? 31.9 meters above and to the right of us. Perhaps those turbo lifts could take us there. Seems to be malfunctioning. The reading I received is from behind this door, sir. My reading is intensifying, sir. Are you getting any life signs? None, sir. Definitely human. Male. Looks like the poor devil died in his sleep. What a terrible way to die. He has been dead for 283 years, sir. The lack of advanced decomposition is due to the sterile environment. Why would anyone go to all this trouble? It's just window-dressing for a dead man. Commander. Is this significant, sir? American. 52 stars, sir. Places it between 2033 and 2079 AD.. It correlates with the debris we found. Colonel S Richey. Rest in peace, Colonel. Picard to Riker. Finally. Riker. Go ahead. Coming through clearly now. What's your situation? This structure was made to resemble 20th-century Earth. All attempts to exit have failed. We can't transport you back yet. I assumed not. We have also found human remains. Request identity scan. Col Richey, American, first initial S. Roughly the same time period. Do it. Commander. Some curiosities. Books. A novel. Hotel Royale? Summarize, please. Information retrieved, Captain. Number One? Go ahead, Captain. We have the information you requested. Col Steven Richey was the CO of the explorer ship Charybdis, which had a terrestrial launch date of July 23, 2037. It was the third manned attempt to travel beyond Earth's solar system. Its telemetry failed. It was never heard from again. Do you believe you've discovered the remains of Col Richey? Yes. And we've found something else, a novel by Todd Matthews, Hotel Royale, the name of this structure. Data. Captain, this is the story of a group of compulsive gamblers, caught up in crime, corruption and deceit. It is told by nefarious lothario, Mickey D, who appears only at the climax, to carry out the cold-blooded murder of the hotel bellboy. There is a subplot about an older man conspiring with a young woman to murder her husband. She squanders her inheritance... Everything that Data just described seems to be happening at this hotel. Extraordinary. There's also a diary with only one entry, obviously made by Colonel Richey. Can you read it? Yes. ""I write this in the hope that it will some day be read by human eyes."" ""I can only surmise that our exploratory shuttle was contaminated by an alien life form which infected and killed all personnel except myself."" ""I awakened to find myself here in the Royale Hotel, precisely as described in the novel in my room. "" ""And for the last 38 years... I have survived here."" ""I have come to understand that the aliens created this place for me out of some sense of guilt, presuming that the novel we had on the ship about the Hotel Royale was in fact a guide to our preferred lifestyle and social habits."" ""They thought this was the world from which I came."" ""I hold no malice for my benefactors, who could not know the hell they put me through. "" ""For it was such a badly written book, filled with endless cliché and shallow characters, I shall welcome death when it comes."" I understand, Number One. Now we know why all that is there. Why can't you get out? Number One. Yes, sir? Lt La Forge has a thought. He believes we can phaser a slice in the field around the structure. Then the atmosphere of the planet would rush in. Projected survival would be approximately 12 seconds. Correct. The cryogenic process would be nearly instantaneous. I assume you could revive us? Yes. In theory. You must understand, Number One, we'll wait for months if necessary. We're just considering options. If you're trying to motivate us to find a way out, you've succeeded. Yes? There is a female voice asking if we want room service. I believe she is asking if we want the room cleaned. Tell her no. No. What did she say? She said the kitchen will be open 24 hours if we change our minds. Let's explore the hotel. We'll keep a comm line open. Check the lobby for anything we missed. Talk to the guests, find out who they are. I'll check the rest of the floors. Computer, locate and display the text of the novel entitled Hotel Royale by Todd Matthews. Accessing. If the cause of the difficulties is in the novel, we may find the solution within its pages. ""It was a dark and stormy night."" It's not a promising beginning. It may get better. I suggest we separate and blend in with these beings. Casual queries, offered inconspicuously, may prove fruitful. I need a four. Gimme a four. Damn... How much do I have left here? Honey, it's bad luck to count your chips at the table. Excuse me, sir. Might I enquire, where are you from? Lubbock, Texas. And how did you get here? Vegas? Drove my car. I got a '91 Caddy with only 85 miles on it. Where is your automobile now? Out front, I suppose. What difference does it make? Could you take me there? Hit me! I'm losing my shirt. Son, why would I want to do that? I'm trying to help this little lady. I believe you are trapped inside the Royale, just as I am. Sure seems that way when you're losing. We're tryin' to turn this lady's wagon around, win back some change. Else she's in a desperate situation with nowhere to turn. Well, almost nowhere. I stay, right? I wouldn't. The odds favour standing pat. What do I do? Do you want a card or not? Hit me. Too many. I've almost lost it all. What am I gonna do? There, there. What did you find? Nothing. Rita just called. What did she say? It was hard to tell. She was crying. Crying? Damn. Mickey D thinks he can treat people any way he wants. Well, that's all over now. You were told! It's not for you to make the call. It's for Rita. Well, she sent me to tell you. OK, boys, look. We can't afford trouble in here. Why don't you take this outside? Yeah, I like that. Come on, baggage man. Let's you and me take it outside. When I was a kid, I looked up to you guys. The suit, the fancy shoes. I really thought that made you somebody, but you're a nobody. I wish I could make something... I don't believe this dialogue. Did humans really talk like that? Not in real life. Remember, everything going on down there is taken from what Col Richey calls a second-rate novel. She could do something with her life... With your permission, sir? She's somebody. She's my girl. The only reason she stays with you is because you feed her sickness. You gotta let me help her! Why don't we go outside and talk about it? Just watch yourself. Don't worry. It's all part of the novel. Don't interfere. You should've listened to me, kid. No woman's worth dyin' for. Killing for, ... ..not dyin' for. Riker to Enterprise. Yes, Number One. A bizarre incident just took place. The shoot-out between the bellboy and Mickey D. Yes. And Mickey D just walked out. How? It's on page 244. The novel, right. How does it end? A bad love affair ends in a bloody shoot-out, the hotel gets bought out, and life goes on, such as it is. The hotel gets bought? By whom? It's not specific. It refers to foreign investors. Sale price, 12.5 million United States dollars. They return home, leaving the assistant manager in charge. Captain, ... ..that's how we're getting out. We're buying this place. It is a question of probability. Quite simple, if one bets with sequential consistency. Elaborate. Combinations of seven or eleven have much value, if achieved on the primary attempt. With eight variations to create those totals, the chance is not significant... OK. Can you do it? I believe so, sir. Eight's the point. Eighter from Decatur. Do it. Snake eyes. Single digits on each cube are not at all desirable. You're almost broke. Relax, honey. It's only money. If you lose it, I might not have a place to sleep. Don't worry your head, honey, I'd never let that happen. Let's go, babe. Here they come. Seven. Your turn, Slick. Go to work. Maybe this turkey will bring us some luck. Six is your number. My blind grandma can make a six! Come on, roll 'em! I thought seven and eleven had value. Actually, six is a valid point. Now the objective is to roll a duplicate six, then a seven. But the probability of a six is no greater than a seven. There is a degree of random fortune involved. That is why they call it gambling. Yeah. Seven. Seven away. Next shooter. So much for your new turkey. Give Slick another shot. I got a feeling about you, boy. Commander, these cubes are improperly balanced. Their resting position... Can you repair them? I believe so. I will make another attempt. Baby needs a new pair of shoes. Eleven! Attaboy! Do that again, we're all gonna get well! Seven, a winner! And another one! Keep goin', boy. We got a hot one! Double 'em up. Here we go. Keep 'em rollin', boy. Seven, a winner. Status, Number One. Rather a nice run of luck, Captain. Don't get out of character. Sir? The foreign investors in the book are seen as ""flamboyantly generous"". Yes, sir. I understand. Seven! Look at that. Tex, darlin', ... you're brilliant! Yeah. And I'm good-lookin', too! Isn't that enough? No. Don't want to come up short. You are keeping count? Yes, sir. 12.3 million. Perhaps I will bet... 700,000. No, bet it all. Sir, the price of this edifice is 12.5 million. We need some spreading around money. Sir? Bet it all. Here, something for you, Ziggy. For the cocktail waitresses. Run this out to the parking lot attendant. You're very kind, sir. Here, a little something for you. Thank you. When the train comes in, everybody rides. Yeah. And I'm getting off at this station. After 18 passes, air gets a little thin for this country boy. I'm bettin' against you, fella. Are you nuts? That is not a prudent choice, sir. That's what horse racing's about. Roll 'em. Seven, a winner. The man has the touch. You knew you were going to throw that seven. You let me go down the tube. I tried to caution you, sir. What was it? Was it personal, or what? Because I didn't show you my car? Now. I wish to cash in, sir. I'm afraid you've broken the bank. Just take 12.5 million for this hotel. Spread the rest around. You're the foreign investors. That's right. We just bought this place, lock, stock and barrel. Consider it a done deal. I like you fellas. You got style. Let me buy you guys a drink. Just enjoy the game. Don't let them change the dice on you. You got it. Enterprise, this is the away team. We're clear. Three to beam up. Time to come home now, Number One. Transporter room, lock on the away team. Beam them up. Come. Sir. Welcome back, Number One. Very strange experience. Puzzling. I can't comprehend how Col Richey's vessel travelled so far. Not on its own at any rate. Perhaps they were brought here by whoever created that make-believe world. It's possible they didn't know how fragile the humans aboard were. Only one of them survived. None of it makes any sense. Like Fermat's theorem, it's a puzzle we may never solve. "
S2E13,"Come on in. Excellent! That's exactly what I needed. Mr Worf. And the good Doctor bearing gifts. Ale from Ennan VI. Your omelettes deserve no less. This is not an efficient method to prepare sustenance. The computer is more efficient, but it isn't subtle enough for great cooking. It would give you the ingredients, but wouldn't allow for flair or individuality. And flair marks the difference between artistry and competence. Historically, the breaking of bread symbolized friendship and community. Something we've got away from in the 24th century. You've a practised hand, Commander. I have my father to thank. Your father liked to cook? No, he hated it. That's why he left it to me. I understand in most human families the woman shares in the cooking. There were only the two of us. I never knew my mother. She died when I was very young. Where did you get these eggs? On our last stop. At Starbase 73? Yeah. What kind of eggs are they? Owon. For you, Data, something special. Don't be afraid. They won't bite you. And for you, Mr Worf. A cook is only as good as his ingredients. Delicious. Number One. Go ahead. Would you join me on the bridge? Right away, sir. We've picked up a signal from a Federation shuttlecraft. How? I thought we were the only manned vessel out here. Apparently not. What's it doing out this far? Where's its mothership? Sensors indicate at least one life form aboard. Humanoid. Perhaps someone to answer your questions. Open hailing frequencies. Communication is not possible. The shuttle has no power. Set course to intercept. Estimate intercept in three minutes. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 42679.2. En route to the Endicor system, we have encountered a Federation shuttlecraft, which has appeared out of nowhere. There are no indications of where it came from or how it got out here. We are closing on the shuttlecraft. Thank you. On screen. Magnify. Prepare the tractor beam. Target vehicle. We will be within tractor-beam range in two seconds. Set automatic locking device. Alert shuttle bay two. Shuttle bay two, prepare for retrieval procedure. Locking tractor beam. Number One. You're with me, Mr Worf. Dr Pulaski, you are needed in shuttle bay two. I've been monitoring. I'm on my way. Engage secondary tractor beam. It's a Federation shuttlecraft, alright. Yet there are no bases or vessels in this area. NCC-1701-D, USS Enterprise. Shuttlecraft 5. NCC-1701-D, USS Enterprise. Shuttlecraft 5. How is this possible? Commander, come here! Captain? Yes, Number One. Are you on the bridge? Where else would I be? Right now, you should be in shuttle bay two. Why? What is it? This you should see for yourself. Bring Cmdr Data. Condition? Life signs are very confusing. Strong heartbeat but weak pulse. Is he injured? There's no signs of trauma. Why is he unconscious? What happened? I can't say. The readings of his brain waves are very strange. Strange? In what way? Not human? Artificial? No, neither. They're just out of phase. Can you revive him? I wouldn't even attempt it till we get him to sickbay. Come on, let's get him out. Counsellor? I have never felt anything like this before, so it's difficult to put into words. That person is you. No. He is as much Jean-Luc Picard as the person I'm standing next to. Beyond that, there is very little I can be sure of. I will have to wait until he regains consciousness. I need to know what's on the shuttle's logs. Aye, sir. Captain, both primary and reserve power has been drained. I need to connect to the Enterprise to activate the shuttle's systems. Geordi, report to shuttle bay two immediately. I'm on my way. I'll be in sickbay. Captain. Seen this? Looks like the damage caused by an antimatter explosion. It must have been just out of range of the shuttlecraft. Data, I need those logs. Counsellor. We'll be on the bridge. Lieutenant. Resume course and speed. Scanners at maximum range. Maximum range. There you go. You should have power now. What happened? The polarity is not compatible. That's not possible. The connection's idiot-proof. The power requirements of the shuttle do not match those of the Enterprise. We will need a variable-phase inverter, to align the power from the Enterprise to the shuttle. Data, what do you think is going on here? Not just the shuttle, I mean everything. I do not have enough information. I'm just starting a complete medical work-up. His vital signs are distorted. Some indicators are depressed, others are fluctuating wildly. I can't explain any of it. But he is alive. The restraints are for his own protection. Have you determined why he's still unconscious? No, but I have been able to rule out any head injury. Wake him. What happened? Apparently, the normal stimulant had the opposite effect. I'll have to try something else. Alright, Data. I think I've got it now. That ought to give you something. Making this power adjustment is very tricky. By all rights, this should blow all the shuttle's circuits. Perhaps you had better step out of the way. Alright. But remember, you're not indestructible yourself, you know. Increase the power. Powering up. Adjust the inverter two percent positive. Two percent positive. The right decision is having the opposite effect. Yes. I can't think of anything that would cause the circuit to change so radically. Adjust the inverter two percent negative. OK. Two percent negative. That's it. It shouldn't work, but it does. Take a look at the stardate. 42679.5. Captain... Go ahead. We've been able to reactivate the shuttle. The clock indicates that the shuttle is six hours in front of us. Captain, do you read me? If the shuttle's from six hours into the future, then so is the other Capt Picard. Captain's log, supplemental. Part of the mystery has been solved. There are two number 5 shuttlecrafts because one is from the future. Six hours, to be exact. And so, presumably, is the facsimile of me. Try and wake him again. No. It's only a sedative. I know. Don't sedate him. Let him be. Please. Let him remain conscious. I've never seen anything like this. Are you alright? Fine. Save your ministrations for your patient. I want a staff meeting in five minutes. I assume you will remain here. Yes, I will monitor the conference from here. Keep me informed of any changes, no matter how small. Captain's log, supplemental. Mr Data has recovered the logs from the duplicate shuttle. I am apprehensive to play back a log which will not be recorded for several hours. We've retrieved all we can from the logs, including the last visual records. Everything else is just a jumble. Show me. The distortion is because we had to use a phase inverter. The quality will improve slightly. According to the log, the Enterprise was destroyed three hours, 19 minutes from now. Captain, we also have a portion of the last log entry. It's audio only. Captain's personal log, supplemental. I have just witnessed the total destruction of the USS Enterprise, with the loss of all hands, save one. Me. All attempts to obtain further information have failed. Well, at least we have something to go on. I don't understand how you could have ended up in a shuttlecraft while the Enterprise was destroyed. Nor I. The last thing you would do is leave the bridge during an emergency. Yes. Alright. Let's proceed on the premise that what we have just seen happened, and that in less than four hours from now... ..the Enterprise will be destroyed, and, somehow, although this is unfathomable, l, and I alone, escape. Discussion. Our destination is the Endicor system. We'll arrive in three days. The charts show nothing to threaten the ship between here and there. Sensors indicated no other vessels, Federation or otherwise, here. Data? I have nothing to offer. There is not enough information upon which to base a hypothesis. The shuttle came from up ahead. Rather than continuing, maybe we should stop here and let whatever it is out there come to us. We may already be too late. What? Stopping, turning, even reversing our course is pointless? When we brought the shuttle and the other Picard on board, we committed to a sequence of events which may be unalterable. Yes, this is not some... rock on the trail, which once seen can easily be avoided. This is much more complex. There is the theory of the Möbius. A twist in the fabric of space where time becomes a loop from which there is no escape. So when we reach that point, whatever happened will happen again. The ship will be destroyed. The other Picard will meet us. And we do it all over again. Sounds like someone's idea of hell. Well, I know this much. We can't avoid the future. Agreed. So let's continue on course. Somewhere out there, something will happen. A decision will be made and I will be separated from the Enterprise. At the time, the decision will seem to be correct, but it won't be. We have to anticipate, and not make... ..not make the same mistake once. Something is waiting for us out there. Let's try and determine what it is, quickly. Doctor? I'm just beginning to realize how much of the body is held together by its own internal clock. He was thrown out of time, which caused his body systems to change their rhythms. Now, slowly, as we get closer to the time that he left, his internal body clock is realigning. Are you saying that when our time intersects with the time he left, in that instant he will function normally, and... ..and there will be two of us? Right now, that is my guess. I don't think that's possible. I'm able to feel much more from him now. His emotions are still a jumble, but... Counsellor? He desperately wants to leave this ship. Captain's log, supplemental. We continue on course to Endicor. We are less than two hours away from our rendezvous with ourselves. Worf. Maximum scan, sir. Nothing unusual to report. If this timetable is correct, we could get an indication soon. Bridge, this is sickbay. Yes, Doctor? Captain, my patient is more coherent. I'm on my way. You have the bridge, Number One. How is he? His vital signs are more normal, more like ours. He is calmer. He's aware of me? Perhaps, in some fashion. But he knows where he is, who's here? I doubt it. What went wrong? You know, don't you? What did you do? What happened? Why did you leave the ship? Don't turn away! Look at me! Picard! Look at me! He doesn't understand you. He knows I'm here. Yes, but in a nightmare of disjointed images and half-heard voices. He's in another dimension, looking at us across a great chasm. He's feeling remorse at what he witnessed. He's afraid. What is he afraid of? Damn you. Help me. Why did you leave the ship? It's no use, Captain. He can't answer you. When we get closer to his time, he may be able to. Are you still convinced he's me? Yes, but you're not convinced. Not in the slightest. Except for his features, there is nothing about him I find familiar. Counsellor, I want you to stay with him. He'll be able to communicate with you before anyone else. I don't know how long anyone could take this anxiety state. There has to be a breaking point. He's handling it very well. He has a lot of anger. Because of what he represents. And what is that? Doubt. He's afraid that seeing him here, and knowing what happened to the Enterprise, will make him timid. Or worse, make him hesitate. Part of my job is to anticipate problems. My duty is to the Captain, but first to the ship and its crew. Doctor, the Captain is quite capable of making command decisions. Yes, for now. But this situation has put him under extreme pressure of a unique and very personal kind. We both know that pressure will only increase. You said yourself that he already has doubt. Which is understandable and healthy. And could be potentially paralyzing. If we begin to see signs that he's acting in an irrational manner, I have the authority and duty to relieve him. I don't think that will be necessary. I hope you're right. What force or phenomenon could cause the shuttle to be thrown back in time? None that we know. In theory, accelerating beyond warp ten. Using the gravitational pull of a star to slingshot back in time? The shuttle doesn't have warp capability. No. So some external force was needed. We've never encountered a natural force that powerful. Why only six hours? Why not a day? Or a year? Are you saying there was some conscious mind at work here? There's no evidence either way. The Traveller moved through time using the power of his mind. I don't think that's the case here. No. And Manheim's experiments with gravity and time were rudimentary and uncontrollable. Captain, I think this is one instance where you should suppress your natural tendencies. Really? One of your strengths is your ability to evaluate the dynamics of a situation, and then take a definitive pre-emptive step, take charge. You're frustrated. You not only can't see the solution, you can't even define the problem. Go on. What we're facing is neither a person nor a place. At least not yet. It's time. You're saying I should shut up and wait? I wouldn't have put it exactly like that. Not something I do easily. Your Persian flaw. Yes, perhaps it is. Captain to the bridge. Report. This energy vortex has just appeared beneath us. There was no warning. Well, at least the waiting's over. Captain's log, supplemental. We have apparently intersected with... something. It is similar to our tractor beam, only much more powerful. Bridge, this is Lt La Forge. Bridge. The pull on the ship is steady. I'm holding the engines at 30 percent to maintain our position. Transfer Engineering control to the bridge. Captain, there is a consciousness here. Not thought, more like instinct. What do you think, Number One? I think we're being probed. The beam is coming from the centre of the vortex. Sensors show it to be only a mass of energy. What is it trying to learn? I think it's trying to determine if we are a life force. We'll stay and investigate. Agreed. Unless that was the mistake. Staying too long. Possibly. We should go now. Well... That would be the prudent move. I never thought I'd hear myself say that. Under the circumstances, sir, I think you're right. But you would rather stay and find out what it is? What is its intent? Engineering, transfer to bridge. Mr La Forge. Sir? Take us out of here. Maximum warp. Aye, sir. I've set the velocity at warp nine. Engage. Warp engines are at 91 percent. Put it to the wall, Mr La Forge. Aye, sir. I can't hold it. The engines can't handle the strain. All stop. Mr La Forge? I'm re-engaging warp engines. Status? All decks have reported. No damage. No injuries. The hold on the Enterprise is strong. I'm at warp seven just to maintain our position. Everything we do tightens its grip. Let's see what we can learn. Launch a class-1 probe. Aye, sir. Mr Worf... That was personal. The power drain needed to hold this position is enormous. How long can you maintain it? Just a few minutes then we'll have to shut down. Captain, some kind of energy just surrounded my patient. Is he alive? Yes. Arm the photons, Mr Worf. Lock on the centre of the vortex. Photon torpedoes on target. Hold for my order. Like a rag in a dog's mouth. I am now at maximum warp. It's you, Captain. It was the entire ship, but now it has focused its attention entirely on you. Captain, I can't hold it. If we don't shut down right now... Hold this position! Counsellor, if I were to leave the Enterprise, would its attention still be focused on me? Yes, I think it would. You'd never survive. But in those few seconds, the Enterprise might break free. That's what he... That's what the other Picard must have thought. Where are you going? You have the bridge. You're leaving the ship? We may be on a road that has no turns. He's very agitated. I must get to the shuttle. I know. Do you know where you are? The Enterprise. But you're only vaguely aware of it. And me? Do you know who I am? No, you don't, do you? I must go! Release him. Do you know what you're doing? No. Release him. Security to sickbay. No! Security, disregard that order and clear all personnel, repeat, all personnel from shuttle bay two. I don't want any distractions. You, stay here. You're leaving the ship? I must. Why? The energy in the vortex wants me. You're certain? Yes. It's an entity, a life form. It recognizes the Enterprise as an entity with me as its brain. Shuttle bay two. What's your other option? This is our only chance. If I leave, it may be distracted long enough for the Enterprise to escape. No. If you leave, the Enterprise will be destroyed. Remember? You saw it happen. If I don't leave the ship, the Enterprise will be destroyed. If that's true, then help me. We both want the ship to be safe. But there is information I don't have. It's me. You? Captain, we're about to lose warp drive. Understood. Understood. When you say it wants you, do you mean still you and not me? You're confusing me. We're almost out of time. I must get to the shuttle. Wait! You can. I'll let you. But, first, tell me, what was your other choice? Stand aside. You must tell me. What was it? You don't know what I'm talking about. You're locked into a single intent unable to change. Unable to alter any of your previous actions. I must leave. There's no other way. There must be. One. But it would never work. What is it? What would never work? I have to leave. What was the other choice? We can't fight. We can't go forward. No, we can't go forward. That would destroy the Enterprise. Was that it? Was that the other choice? I must leave. No! Capt Picard! I cannot allow you to leave. Before we can go forward, ... the cycle must end. Dr Pulaski, report to shuttle bay two. Bridge. Number One, we're wasting energy trying to escape. Set a course for the centre of the vortex. Mr La Forge, on my command, all the power you can muster. Yes, sir. We're going in? Yes. Course set, sir. Now everyone hold their position. No matter what. Engage. Capt Picard? Shuttle bay two. The other Picard and the shuttle are gone. Explain. They just... vanished. What's our position? We are back on course to Endicor. Stand down from red alert. All decks have reported in. No damage, no casualties. You have the bridge, Number One. A lot of questions, Number One. Damn few answers. Maybe none of it was real. Perhaps we were all part of a shared illusion. Or maybe he was thrown back in time, so that we would be able to take another road. Make a different choice. They say if you travel far enough, you will eventually meet yourself. Having experienced that, Number One, it's not something I would care to repeat. I'll be on the bridge, sir. "
S2E14,"Captain's log, stardate 42686.4. We are going to Starbase Montgomery for Engineering consultations prompted by minor read-out anomalies. I consider them insignificant. What if you're wrong? Sorry. But what if it is more than a mere discrepancy? Then we have a problem. Agreed. Montgomery can give us an independent reading. Even if controls have failed, we can re-crystallize dilithium without outside help. Don't worry. My ego isn't at stake here. We could reprogram the system to correct the variables. That's an option, but as we're stopping at Montgomery anyway, they can do the analysis. I don't recall Montgomery being on the itinerary. We could all use a 12-hour layover. I've received some personnel transfer directives, priority matter. Boarding or disembarking? We're approaching Starbase Montgomery. Go to half-impulse power. Will you come to the observation lounge when you're done? Captain? I've been recollecting the arrival of a new First Officer on board the Enterprise, and a manual docking confidently achieved. Well, I may have been miserly in my congratulations then, so let me make up for it now. The Captain of Starship Aries is retiring. Congratulations. You've been selected as his replacement. She's in the Vega-Omicron Sector. They have picked up indications of intelligent life, though nothing confirmed. Starfleet wants to know more. That's why they want you, not for your military proficiency, but for your skill as an explorer, and as a diplomat. It'll take months just to get there. With no guarantee of finding anything when you arrive. You have 12 hours to consider it. And if it's not too premature, congratulations, Captain. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Establish synchronous orbit. Aye, sir. Montgomery is sending a civilian adviser to brief you on the mission. A personal briefing? An attaché with knowledge in the frontier regions. You'll find the briefing interesting. I hope it's complete. My decision will be based on it. Cmdr Riker to transporter room three. Enjoy. Ensign. You're right on time, Commander. He's on his way now. Dad. You're the civilian adviser and attaché? I wanted it kept quiet. I didn't want to get you excited. It's been 15 years. Excitement is hardly appropriate. You've done well. First Officer on the Enterprise. Quite a feather in your cap. I've worked hard. Of course. I'm proud of you, son. Excuse me. I have my duties. When you've settled in, we can complete our briefing. Have Security arrange an escort. Aye, sir. Worf, did you hear about Cmdr Riker's promotion? He didn't know it was his father. Imagine if it was your father. I never knew mine. Nor me. It is a waste of time to think of such things. I wasn't, but everybody needs somebody. Enough! Montgomery didn't have to send all this help. I've checked for anomalous frequencies, so don't waste your time on that. Wes. Are you OK? I was just talking to Worf. He's really eccentric at times. That's one word for it. He was really upset. I must've said something wrong. Maybe he's just not thrilled at the prospect of losing Cmdr Riker. I'm not. Neither am l, but with Worf it was something else. Something's really bothering him. Think so? Female? No. Career? Family. That is trouble. You choose your enemies and friends, but family, that's in the stars. So I've heard. Kyle Riker! Excuse me, ladies. Great to see you. Kyle. Been a long time. This is more than a surprise, it's a total shock. You didn't bake me a cake? You're actually here. That makes two of us. How about a drink? How about a kiss? They know each other. No kidding? I know her, too, but we don't do that. You look wonderful. It has nothing to do with Cmdr Riker's assignment? No. His reaction was the opposite of mine. Completely unaffected. With all that's going on, maybe you're overreacting. Really? You try talking to Worf, Geordi. He is not normal for Worf. There is a predisposition toward hostility in Klingons, but Worf has been unusually out of sorts. He's never been much on charm. I think we should try to help. He is our friend. l, for one, want to keep him friendly. Suggestions? Empirical study. Monitor the subject. Right. Watch the subject for unusual behaviour. Won't be difficult. Within the norm of Klingon patterns. Discretion will be required. Agreed. When do we start? We will assist you as needed. You found the problem. And you must solve it. Thank you. After working out the Fuurinkazan battle strategies at the Tokyo Base, I was asked to come here as an adviser. I'm surprised how long you stayed out of action. Will, your father and I were just catching up. You never said you knew him. Well, it wasn't exactly a secret. It just never came up. Sit down, son. I'm ready for that briefing if you are. It was a pleasure. Good to see you too, Graham. Are you running for Mayor? Do pick-up work long enough, and it'll happen to you, too. I thought about you a lot. You don't need to say anything. We could've been great together. Possibly. Is it true you got married? Again. And again. That makes you three for three? I'm not complaining. They're good men and we're all friends. Like us? Close, but different. They were all a bit more in touch with themselves. Face facts. You're crusty. You have a reputation for being hard as nails, but underneath, you're not so bad. Some of us even love you. And then there's Will. Then there's Will. Wesley should be doing this on his own. But he needs his study time. I can't believe you fell for that. He looks perfectly normal to me. In solitude, there is nothing to trigger unusual behaviour. Good point. Let's not tamper with the status quo. But that would defeat our opportunity for research. In all probability, he is simply lonely. We can relieve his anxiety through socialization. Be my guest. Excuse me, Lieutenant. You seem to have lost the will to communicate with others. You have friends here. We... We care about you. Geordi, Wesley and I were saying... With all due respect, ... be gone! Sir. He seems... quite sincere in his desire for solitude. Seeing is believing? Come in. Worf? May I have a moment, sir? Of course. What is it? It is very difficult to say. Words are not always easy for me. Is that Earth? Yes, Alaska. I was nine years old. That is a fish you're holding. And I didn't even catch it. But it looks like you... Hooked it. My father took the rod away. He was afraid I'd lose it. You do not have good feelings for him? No, I... Well, I'm not sure what I'm feeling. What's on your mind? You are leaving the Enterprise? I've been offered a command. I would like to join you. I haven't accepted the assignment. But it could be dangerous. There may be combat. That is not the purpose. Still, to die a true hero... Worf, you've made your point. I know you will do the right thing. Finally, we're alone. Maybe now we can talk. I'm here for the briefing. All you need to know is here. This could have been transmitted. I've heard good things about you. Then why haven't I heard from you? I know. Keeping in touch is not my strong suit. It's a funny thing about being a parent. There are no tech manuals. No read-outs to get you through. You just wing it from day to day. Will, when your mother died... Excuse me. I've got to study this briefing. Will, I came to the Enterprise because... Considering where you might be going, I wanted to... I'm here with my hand out, son. Poor guy. Picked up a flu virus at Nasreldine. Nasty. What's the therapy? Tryptophan-lysine distillate, with a generous dose of PCS. PCS? Pulaski's chicken soup. You haven't lost your touch. When they hurt, I hurt. Dr Pulaski's greatest medical skill is her empathy. You must be Cmdr Riker's father. Yes. How...? We've all heard about you, and I felt certain things. Deanna Troi, ship's Counsellor. Kyle Riker. I thought you should meet. Deanna keeps us from deluding ourselves. Let me guess, Betazoid? At your service. I have work to do. Please excuse me. Why do I get the feeling that this is a setup? Because you're intelligent, wise and quite correct. Well, I've never been set up better, that's for sure. You're also very anxious about something. It's Will, isn't it? You're not as close as you'd like. I don't know. We both have good taste in women, wouldn't you say? I'd like to help you if I can, ... if you'll let me. Fine. What do you want from me? I came here to bury the hatchet with my son, only to find out that the ground was frozen solid. You don't seem the kind to give up so easily. I didn't say I was giving up. It would just be nice to get something from him. What do you want? I don't know. Acknowledgement or... Respect is earned, not bestowed. Respect? I don't need that from him. You want him to be proud of you. You take pride in his accomplishments. Absolutely. First Officer of the Enterprise, just been offered his first command. Yet you covet his success. Please. He'd be lucky to have the career I've had. True. You're well respected in your field. I have a reputation for excellence. And false humility. My guess is that Will finds you pretty fascinating. Candour seems to be a trait he admires. Honesty is the trait he admires most. You should honestly consider why you're so competitive with your own son. Competitive? Maybe in the past. But I'm here to help Will prepare for his first task as Captain. Will he accept such a dangerous assignment? He'll accept it because it is dangerous. How can you be so sure? Because I would. And we aren't so different, Will and I. Come in. You've seen your mission briefing? Any questions? No, other than one about the Aries's First Officer. Yes. Flaherty. Yes. It mentions something about ""an uncanny linguistic skill"". An understatement. The last time I saw Cmdr Flaherty, he spoke 40 languages. As I recall, among the more exotic were Romulan, Klingon, Giamon, Stroyerian. He speaks 40 languages? He has this ability of instantly interpreting and extrapolating any verbal communication he hears. You will find him very useful in Vega-Omicron. I'm sure I will. Come in. Capt Picard, at last. Thank you for the help you've given my son. My only regret is that your reunion marks Will's farewell. But he's ready for this command. Yes, I have no doubt. May I have a word with my son? Of course. Excuse me, gentlemen. I won't be pushed into this decision. Come on. Don't you think you're ready for the Aries? Starfleet does. You're the best candidate. But I'm here if you need me. I've been alone since I was 15. I can take care of myself. Please, spare me the pain of your childhood. I hung in for 13 years. If that wasn't enough, too bad. Data, what if I missed something? The computer would have corrected it. Maybe my inputs were incorrect. Data, Geordi. I figured out Worf's problem. You spoke to him? No. I accessed the Klingon cultural database. It took time. OK, Wesley, slow down. What is the problem? It's the tenth anniversary of Worf's Age of Ascension. His what? The Age of Ascension. A ritual of great significance. A rite of initiation marking a new level of spiritual attainment. What is the significance of the anniversary? It's a day of celebration spent with fellow Klingons. Worf doesn't have any Klingon friends. We're his friends. We don't practise his tradition. And we're not Klingons. Worf is culturally and socially isolated. What do you suggest? We can't invite a bunch of Klingons on board. The computer could supply simulations on the holodeck. Holographic Klingons. Sure. Why not? We need only to program in specific details of the ceremony. The cultural database said the Klingon's family must attend. So? We're his family. We'll go. I just wonder what kind of party the Klingons have. Have you got a minute? Sure. I wanted to apologize. Your personal life is none of my business. Even if it involves your father? Even if it involves my father. Did he ever tell you why he never remarried? What woman would have him with an ego like that? I would have, in a cold minute. 12 years ago, Kyle Riker was a civilian strategist advising Starfleet in its conflict with the Tholians. The starbase he was operating from was attacked. None of the base crew was expected to live, and they all died, all except your father. Your father alone had the will to endure, to face the pain, to live. I never knew that about him. I've never seen a man fight so hard in all my life. And you fell in love? Yes. And so did he. But marriage was out of the question. He had other priorities. His career. If I were you, going out on the Aries, I'd jettison the emotional baggage you carry around. The cultural database was specific on the setting. Let me guess. 20-piece orchestra, magnificent ballroom, formal wear... No, there's some unusual test of inner strength. That would entail Klingon painstiks. Painstiks? Sounds lovely. Enduring physical suffering is a Klingon spiritual test. So for Worf to celebrate his anniversary, he has to be hurt? And we have to witness this? We are his family. Come. Number One? I'd be a fool to turn promotion down, wouldn't I? I don't know. And if you're asking what to do, I don't know that either. I can spell out, albeit crudely, what you're choosing between. As First Officer of the Enterprise, you have a position of distinction, prestige, even glamour of a sort. You are the second-in-command of Starfleet's flagship, but still second-in-command. Your promotion will transfer you to a relatively insignificant ship in an obscure corner of the galaxy. But it will be your ship, and being who you are, it will soon be vibrant with your authority, your style, your vision. You know, ... ..there is no substitute for holding the reins. I'll need a little more time to make this decision. Find anything yet? Not yet. There is nothing to find. No harm in checking, I guess. Really? How would you like them to give the transporter a once-over? No problem. We're totally shipshape. The point is that they even suspect a malfunction. If I were not a consummate professional, and an android, I would find this entire procedure insulting. Thanks, Data. Chief, could you attend a little party for Lt Worf at 1700 hours? A party for Worf? Sounds intriguing. I'd be delighted. It's a surprise. My lips are sealed. I couldn't leave without saying goodbye. I don't like goodbyes. How about ""until next time""? How about ""until next time""? It's been a pleasure working with you, Commander. The feeling is mutual, Counsellor. I'm meant to know how everyone feels, but... I can't read you right now. Perhaps your own feelings are getting in the way. I'm here to help others sort out their emotions. My feelings are beside the point. Not to me. Our feelings are what make us all human. Are you feeling sad? Yes, I am. So am I. I leave at 2100 hours. Can I have a minute? I've practised my best Academy courtesy, now you should go. We need to talk, so lower your shields. I'm asking you to leave or I'll... You'll what? It's a shame there's no anbo-jytsu ring nearby. Really? There is. Deck 12. The gymnasium. We can clear the air once and for all. You're on. Scuttlebutt says you wanted to see me. That's right. I thought I knew you. You do, as well as anyone. Then what is this anbo-jytsu match with Will? You've heard. Haven't we grown beyond the point of resolving our problems with physical conflict? I think you're overreacting. Me? You're the one who's fighting his own son. It's not a fight so much as a contest. And if one of you is injured? I know a good doctor. Kate... Kyle... We've played anbo-jytsu since Will was eight. He knows how to take care of himself. So do I. Don't take this personally, but Will is in his prime. And I'm no spring chicken. I know. Don't worry. He's never been able to beat me. Computer, is this it? Correct. Klingon rite-of-Ascension chamber. Is this really necessary? If we want to help Worf, it is. Computer, give us Klingon personnel appropriate to this event. These images have been specifically programmed for Ascension rites. Cute bunch. And they use those? Those are Klingon painstiks. I once saw one of them used against a two-ton Rectyne monopod. Poor creature jumped five meters at the slightest touch. It finally died from excessive cephalic pressures. You mean...? Right. The animal's head exploded like... I think that's enough, Chief O'Brien. I do not enjoy riddles. You will enjoy this one. I'm in no mood for trifling or games, not today. I know how important today is for you, the anniversary of your rite of Ascension. You know about that? All your friends on board do. That is impossible. It is a secret known only to Klingons. And certain resourceful young ensigns. Wesley Crusher. What does he know about it? Just bear with me. Where are we going? The holodeck. This is truly trying my patience. I think you will approve. You're not coming in? No. Open. An Ascension ceremony. Happy anniversary. Shall we begin? I am ready. Today, I am a warrior. I must show you my heart. I travel the river of blood! The true test of Klingon strength is to admit one's most profound feelings while under extreme duress. The battle is mine! I crave only the blood of the enemy. The bile of the vanquished flows over my hands. Thank you. Is Lt Worf alright? He's never been happier. So it was a good ceremony? I didn't stay for refreshments. You don't enjoy Klingon culture? I'm glad that humans have progressed beyond the need for barbaric display. Have they? Cmdr Riker and his father are in the gymnasium, about to engage in barbarism. Don't remind me. I do not approve. In spite of human evolution, there are still some traits endemic to gender. They'll knock each other's brains out because they're men? Human males are unique. Fathers regard their sons as children, even into adulthood. Sons chafe against their fathers' perceived expectations. It's as if they never grow up at all. Perhaps that's part of their charm, and why we find them so attractive. Particularly men like Cmdr Riker. And his father. I hope they don't injure each other. Anbo-jytsu, the ultimate evolution in the martial arts. I remember my early lessons. You could never get used to the sightless factor, or to losing. True, but I've had 15 years to practise. Well, let's see if you've learned anything. Well! You've been practising. And remembering. You should have been the one to die, not her. Good. Get it all out. I had you. Listen, Will. You were too young to understand and I was too hurt to explain. You were never too hurt for anything. She was your mother, but she was my wife. When she died, all that kept me going was you. You had a strange way of showing it. I thought we could talk this out, but maybe you're right. Maybe I am no father, and you're no son. And this fight is all we have left. Wait! What now? You can't do that. What? Hachidan kiritsu. It's illegal. You're kidding? All these years... That's why I never won. You were cheating. It worked, didn't it? Kept you coming back for more. Incredible. You cheated me. How'd you get away with it? You were a kid. I knew I couldn't take you, but I had to keep you interested. I always hated you for that. Damn it. You were barely out of diapers when she died! You hardly knew her. I'd loved her. You carried pain. So did I. I should have explained this long ago, but it hurt too much. Then the wall grew up between us. And, living together, it got bigger. You know, ... it's funny. I can talk to a roomful of admirals about anything in the galaxy, ... ..but I can't talk to you about how I feel. How do you feel? How do you think? I love you, son. I'd better go back to the starbase. I know. I'm glad you came. Be careful now, OK? Montgomery's specialist and analytical team have beamed down. What were the analytical team's findings? They suggested reprogramming the system to correct read-out variables. Precisely what Cmdr Data recommended, as I recall. At least it gave Cmdr Riker the chance to consider his promotion. Now that he's accepted, we can leave him at Starbase Montgomery. Number One. Captain. With your permission, I've decided to stay on the Enterprise. Granted. Thank you, sir. Take us out of orbit, Ensign. Breaking synchronous orbit, sir. Set course for Beta Kupsic. That is still our destination? Velocity, warp factor five. Course and speed set, sir. Any particular reason for this change of heart? Self-interest. Right now, the best place for me to be is here. Engage. "
S2E15,"Captain's log, stardate 42695.3. We are the first manned vessel to enter the Selcundi Drema sector. Probes have recorded unusual levels of geological activity in all five planetary systems. I hope the Enterprise will find the answer to this enigma. Commander, I have been reviewing the unmanned-probe scans. At some point in the last 150 years, the fifth planet of Selcundi Drema shattered, forming an asteroid belt. I'd call that ""geological instability"". Was it caused by an unknown intelligence? This is geology not malevolence. These planets live fast, die hard. The question is why? You won't reconsider? No. I'll just watch you and be impressed. An optimistic vote of confidence from a non-rider. I never thought of you as an animal person. Small animals, no, but horses... Program the holodeck for a woodland setting with a bridle path and an appropriate mount. Type? Andorian zabathu? Klingon sark? Earth horse. Breed? Arabian. The Arabs believed Allah gathered the south wind and made the horse. On the holodeck, we've made that legend come true. I like that. Computer, English tack and I will control the animal myself. Enter when ready. You like horses for the romance? It goes deeper than that. A fine warhorse would sleep in a Bedouin's tent, carry him in battle, feed his children with her milk. There is a bond which is created by mutual need. Hello, beautiful. Now I understand. You don't want the comfort of a pet, you want a companion. Thank you. I don't want to anthropomorphize anything. It seems that some creatures have the capacity... ..to fill spaces you never knew were empty. I had a Betazoid kitten once. My mother and the cat reacted badly to one another. Sure you don't want to try? It's very relaxing. We can find you something quiet and gentle. No, I prefer my mode of transport not to have a mind of its own. Strange. I would expect Betazoids to be outstanding animal trainers. We become too involved in the shifting passions of the beast. We lose our way and get swept up in emotion. I would have thought this beast would be far more terrifying. Captain. Yes, Number One? We're in the first system. You should be here. Something interesting? Spectacular. A little terrifying. I'm on my way. The first long-range reading. Magnification ten to the sixth. Impressive. And deadly. The last unmanned probe showed a thriving ecosystem. Now there's nothing. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. This is Cmdr Riker's meeting. I need your advice. I'm responsible for overseeing Wesley's education. I would like to put him in charge of the planetary mineral surveys. It's a big job with a lot of responsibility. The game should scare you a little. Wesley's going to need a team. It takes presence to lead. Is he ready? Leadership grows from self-confidence, which is also part of a Starfleet officer's education. All true, but there's an old horse-trainer's adage about putting too much weight on a young back. We don't want him to break under pressure. We're shifting focus here. Are we discussing a young officer on a fast-track to the Academy? Or a young man we are guiding through adolescence into adulthood? You can't guide someone into adulthood. The experiences are unique to each person. Whether Wes succeeds or fails, he will learn from the experience. I agree. I'm just questioning the speed at which we're moving. You think we're pushing too hard? It's a valid concern. Tempering is taken to extremes. He is a boy, not a sword. Who will one day become a man. And to extend the metaphor, he'll need a fine edge that won't dull at the first touch of resistance. Eventually, he has to feel the burden of command. Ensign Crusher, report to the observation lounge. Wesley, you're assigned command of the planetary mineral surveys. Sir? Thank you, sir. Wait till you see how much work it entails. Assemble a team. Look at records of the Drema quadrant. There's a mystery here. We've got to solve it. Yes, sir. A team, sir? This is a serious responsibility. I know, sir. These officers are here to assist you, not judge. Help you. Make use of them. They are a valuable resource. And by the way, I respect an officer who is prepared to admit ignorance and ask a question rather than one who out of pride will blunder blindly forward. I understand, sir. Ensign. You're dismissed. I'll try not to disappoint you. Is this part of your duties? No, a personal project. I have reset the sensors to scan for frequencies outside the usual range. Such as? Dips and peaks of the galaxy's magnetic field, organic molecules and nebular clouds, cosmic rays. Interesting. Would these scans detect artificial transmissions as well as natural signals? Of course. Good. Those signals are faint and hard to distinguish from background noise. Hence I am boosting the power. I will move that to my quarters. Good. Hi. Can I walk with you? Yes. I need advice. It's free. Walking or advice? Both. It's my team. I'm considering so many factors, I'm confusing myself. What have you done? Broken down the task and picked the best people. Prixus in mineralogy and metallurgy, Alans and Hildebrandt for volcanology and geomechanics. Davies. But... But they're all older than you. Right. It makes me feel strange. What about personality conflicts? They're professionals. If there's a personality conflict, you settle it. So you have to understand the job, and be counsellor. Sometimes. Well, ... thank you. Captain's log, stardate 42696.3. We are entering the second Selcundi star system, where Acting Ensign Crusher will begin his planetary mineral survey. The results may help unlock the geological puzzle. Ensign Davies? You got him. Wesley Crusher. I'm leading the geological surveys. I'd like you on my team. Sounds great. Who else is on it? I have Prixus, and Alans and Hildebrandt. Shame you didn't talk to me first. It's just personal opinion, but I like to break up married teams. I hadn't thought of that. Don't worry. They'll be fine. And if you need any help, just give me a signal and I'll take over. Can't get too beat up on your first command. Thanks, but I'm pretty sure I'll be alright. Computer, identify please. Sensors indicate low-level RF waves. Is there a pattern? Affirmative. Naturally occurring? Negative. Key universal translator. Unable to comply. Weak signal. Lock on comm link and boost. Lock-on complete. Read, please. Insufficient signal strength. Enhance, please. Is anybody out there? Yes. Wes? Hi, Dr Pulaski. You have trouble behind that door? My team's in there. I have to assign planets, set a schedule. Sounds like it's under control. I haven't had to deal with them professionally. The minute you walk through that door, they're your team. You have nothing to prove. You have the authority. Only cos Cmdr Riker says so. It's up to you to hang on to it. Now, you'd better get in there, and, Wes? For what it's worth, I think you're gonna do fine. Captain's log, stardate 42737.3. It has been six weeks since our entrance into Selcundi Drema. Each system has revealed the same disturbing geological upheavals on every planet. This is where we can expect the greatest tectonic stresses. I agree. Nice job. My scan results on the third Selcundi system. It's just the same old song. Didn't you say that UV absorptions indicate traker deposits? Where there's traker, there's usually dilithium. We should run an ico-spectogram. These readings are really faint. I think I'd still run an ico-gram. It's a major undertaking. It'd be five hours minimum. I don't want a halfway job. There's being thorough, and there's wasting time. A good officer will recognize the difference. Maybe you're right. Computer, access volcanic and tectonic-plate activity in Drema IV. Accessing. Computer, locate Capt Picard. Capt Picard is on holodeck three. Data? An excellent steed, sir. Sorry to disturb you. It's alright. It must be important. Yes, sir. It is important. Very. Eight weeks ago, I received a transmission, a four-word message, ""Is anybody out there?"" I answered it. There is... ..a loneliness inherent in that whisper from the darkness. Yes, sir. I am glad you understand, sir. But it didn't end there. No, sir. We speak often. It is a young female. Humanoid. Her society is aware that there is interstellar life? No, sir. Where does she think you're calling from? I have kept that vague. But Sarjenka, that is her name, has been quite specific, giving details of her family and friends. Interspersed among these have been some alarming references. Go on. Drema IV endures the same geological stresses we have found in the other systems. Then your friend is in trouble. What are you proposing? If we can determine the cause of these disturbances, we might be able to reverse the process. Violate the Prime Directive? I was hoping you might have another option, sir. We don't even know if this catastrophe is preventable. Call a conference in my quarters. All senior staff. Yes, sir. And, Data? All communication with this life form must cease. Yes. I understand, sir. ..seeing the look on his face. I'll get you another drink. Two more. Thank you. Family emergency. You don't look like you came to relax. I didn't. I need your advice. Yesterday, when Ensign Davies turned in the survey, I asked for an ico-spectogram. He didn't agree. D'you think you were right? Yes. I guess. I could have just been picking nits. Or been intimidated. It's tough to tell people what to do. I suppose I could have made it an order. But how do you order someone older and more experienced? The difference in ages between you two is not the issue. I guess not. Might it have to do with ego? No. It's the opposite of ego. Every time I give an order, I think, ""What makes my judgement so superior to these people's?"" Wes, responsibility and authority go hand in hand. I know you're responsible. Now you need to learn authority. You were given command so you can make some right decisions which will lead to a pattern of success and build self-confidence. If you don't trust your own judgement you don't belong in command. What if I'm wrong? It's arrogant to think you'll never make a mistake. But what if it's something really important, not a mineral survey? What if somebody dies because I made a mistake? In your position, it's important to ask yourself one question. What would Picard do? He'd listen to everyone then make his own decision. But he's Captain. So? Is his decision ever questioned? No way. And why not? I'm not sure. Cmdr Riker, report to the Captain's quarters. When you figure it out, you'll understand command. I'm on my way. Did that help? Tell me what you decide. I've decided. I'm going to have Davies run that ico-gram. Thank you, sir. You're welcome. I'll see you later. OK. Ensign Davies? I want that ico-spectogram on Selcundi Drema. You got it. It is not a matter of how wrong Data was, or why he did it. The dilemma exists. We have to discuss the options. And please talk freely. There are no options. The Prime Directive is not a matter of degrees. It is an absolute. I have a problem with that rigidity. It seems callous and even cowardly. I'm sure that is not what the Lieutenant meant, but in such a situation, we must be cautious. What we do today may profoundly affect the future. If we could see every possible outcome... We'd be gods, which we're not. If there is a cosmic plan, is it not the height of hubris to think that we should interfere? So the Dremans are fated to die? We should consider that option. Considered and rejected. Are we not a part of any cosmic plan? Our presence here at this time could be a part of fate. And we could be meant to interfere. That eliminates the possibility of fate. But, Commander, the Dremans are not a subject for philosophical debate. They are a people. We make an exception in the deaths of millions. Yes. Is it the same situation if it's an epidemic, not a geological calamity? Absolutely. What about war? If generations of conflict is killing millions, do we interfere? Well, we're all a little less secure in our moral certitude. What if it's not just killings? If an oppressive government is enslaving millions? The Prime Directive has many different functions, not the least of which is to protect us. To prevent us from allowing emotions to overwhelm our judgement. My emotions are involved. Data's friend is going to die. That means something. To Data. Does that invalidate the emotion? What if they asked for help? Yes. Sarjenka's transmission could be viewed as a call for help. Sophistry. I'll buy that excuse. We're jigging madly on the head of a pin anyway. She cannot ask for help from someone she does not know. She knows me. What a perfectly vicious little circle. We are going to allow her to die, are we not? Data, I want you to sever the contact with Drema IV. Isolating frequency. Data, where are you? Why won't you answer? Are you angry with me? Please, I'm so afraid. Where are you? Wait. Your whisper from the dark has now become a plea. We cannot turn our backs. Captain's log, stardate 42741.3. We are entering into orbit of Drema IV, the planet from which Data received the signal. Sensors indicate that volcanic activity is increasing. We found the reason for the instability. We would've missed it if Crusher hadn't requested an ico-gram. Drema IV has the largest deposit of dilithium ore ever recorded. It's laid out in an unusual pattern. The crystals form perfectly aligned lattices. The ore forms generator strata. Creating a piezoelectric effect. In plain English, the dilithium is causing the geological catastrophe. The crystals take the planet's heat... ..and turn it into mechanical energy. It increases tectonic stresses... ..that tear the planet apart. Then the crystals break down, which is why we found traces of illium 629. That takes care of ""why"". Now, what can you do? That is going to take more work. Can you reverse the process? We think so. No. No theories, no half-answers. Yes or no? We'll get to work on it. Sir. Data's out there now, monitoring the condition on Drema IV. The situation's desperate for his friend. He's calculated the safest place on the planet's surface. You can guess why. We're just getting deeper and deeper in, aren't we? She's going to die. They all are. Unless... Yes, unless. Alright, you can tell Cmdr Data he has my permission to contact his friend and conduct her to a safer location. Number One, you know where we are now. Sir? Sarjenka, this is Data. Please respond. Unable to complete transmission. Reason for failure? Atmospheric activity interfering with RF signal. We're modifying probes to become resonators. Torpedo casings will protect them for burrowing beneath the surface. How will these resonators destroy the crystals? By emitting harmonic vibrations to shatter the lattices. We will monitor and adjust the frequency of the resonators. Sounds like a plan. Let's get started. Captain. Tea, Earl Grey, hot. Captain, permission to beam down to Drema IV. What? I've been unable to contact Sarjenka. Data, I appreciate your concern. Transporting to the surface will make a bad situation worse. Sir, it is important to determine the reason for... Come on, Data. Your orders were to deliver the message? Yes. Then what is the difference between sending the message and delivering it? A big one and you know it. We have come this far. In for a penny, in for a pound? Yes, sir. Oh, hell. Go. Sir? Number One, handle the transporter. Go. Where are we now? Take a nap. You didn't see this. I'll just be standing here, dozing off. Ten minutes. If you see anyone but Sarjenka... I will signal for immediate beam-out. Cmdr Riker to the bridge. Damn. I just woke up, sir. I'll have him out of there smooth as ice. Sarjenka? Wait. I'm Data. Data. You came. Where have you been? There isn't time to explain. You and your family must leave. We already have. We ran when the tremors began. Why are you here? My father wouldn't let us take anything, but I had to have my transmitter. I knew you'd come back, and I didn't want you to find only silence, the way I did. I am sorry for that. But it is very complicated. Does your family know where you are? No. You cannot survive in this. What are we going to do? Enterprise, two to beam up. You must come with me. Where are we going? To the stars? There'll be hell to pay. Where is Cmdr Riker? On the bridge. Where are you going? To the bridge. And you're taking that? Please don't leave me here. Quite impossible. Sir, three minutes to resonator launch. Where is he? He'll be here. He has brought a child onto my ship and on my bridge. I'm sure Mr Data has a good explanation. I do, sir. She was frightened and... Mr Data, kindly assume your station. Counsellor, will you escort her to sickbay? No, Data, I'm scared. Don't make me go. No one's going to hurt you. No. We'll go and get a treat... No. Captain, she will not be in the way. One minute to launch. It'll be alright. No. Just leave me alone. I want Data. Counsellor, allow me, please. Sarjenka, no one will harm you. These are my friends. Mr Data, take your station and keep her with you. This does concern her. Ten seconds. I will require my hand. Thank you. Firing torpedoes. Sensors locked on probes. Torpedoes have reached their targets. Resonators activated. Harmonic sequences have begun. What are you doing? Trying to quiet your planet. If we succeed, there will be no more quakes, no more volcanoes. When will the results be known? They should happen very quickly, sir. And my parents and brothers? Captain, sensors indicate a planet-wide reduction in tectonic-stress levels. It worked. We did it! Your parents will be safe now. You did this for me? Look, Sarjenka. There is your home. Data, escort her to sickbay. Aye, sir. Number One, you have the bridge. Doctor. Yes, Captain? Data and the alien are on their way. What would be involved in removing all memory of her communication with Data and her visit to this ship? Assuming that her brain structure is similar to ours, the memories will be stored chemically on the neurons of the cerebral cortex. They're also time-dependent. I would have to scan for the age of the chemical links and try to find the relevant neurons. Well, do your best. You have many kinds of people here. Yes. When I am bigger, can I be here? I am certain you could. I wish I could come now. I am afraid that is not possible. I know, but I can still wish for it. Dr Pulaski, this is Sarjenka. Hello, Sarjenka. Hello. What is this? That's an Elanian singer stone. It sings a different song for each person. What does it sing for you? It does not sing for me. Why not? Because I am a machine. Sarjenka, we're going to run a few scans to be sure you're alright. Data will be right here. Don't worry. You did a good thing. But are we doing a good thing now? This is to protect her as much as us. By robbing her of memories? To remember you and this ship would complicate her future. She has to be the person she was born to be. And you'll remember her. Enterprise, one to beam up. Sit down. No, thank you, sir. I'm not qualified enough to sit there. You did a good job. I'm proud of you. Thank you, sir. Does it get any easier? No. Come. I came to apologize, sir. No apologies are necessary. You reminded us that there are obligations that go beyond duty. I appreciate your seeking other options. Your decision could have been unilateral. One of my officers, one of my friends, was troubled. I had to help. Is Sarjenka safely home? Yes, sir. She will not remember me, sir, but I will remember her. Remembrance and regrets are also a part of friendship. Yes, sir. And understanding that has brought you a step closer to understanding humanity. "
S2E16,"Hot chocolate, please. We don't ordinarily say ""please"" to food dispensers here. Since it's listed as intelligent circuitry, why not? Working with artificial intelligence can be dehumanizing. So why not combat that tendency with a little simple courtesy? Thanks. For someone just aboard, you aren't shy with your opinions. Have I been talking too much? No. I do tend to have a motor mouth, especially when I'm excited. This assignment is so exciting. Lieutenant. Everyone in class wants the Enterprise. It would have been fine to spend time on Reiner VI, doing phase work with antimatter. That's my specialty. I know. That's why you got this assignment. I did it again. It's just that... I know. You're excited. Look, Sonya, I don't think you want to be around control stations with hot chocolate. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have this in Engineering. I forgot I had it. I'll go and finish it over here. Lt La Forge? This will not happen again. No! I'm sorry. Captain... Actually, it's my fault, sir. Indeed. I wasn't looking. It's all over you. Yes, Ensign, it is. At least, let me, sir... Ensign...? Ensign Sonya Gomez. A recent Academy graduate, sir. She transferred at Starbase 173. Is that so? Well, Ensign Sonya Gomez, it will be simpler if I change my uniform. Captain, I must accept full responsibility for this. Yes, Chief Engineer, I think I understand. I just want to say, sir, that I am very excited about this assignment and I promise to serve you and my ship, your ship, this ship, to the best of my ability. Yes, Ensign, I'm sure that you will. Carry on. My... Don't they say first impressions are the most important? I'll give you this. It's a meeting the Captain won't soon forget. Deck nine, officers' quarters. Crewman, what is going on? Welcome, Picard, to shuttlecraft 6. Q... Haven't we been careless? A cleaning service I'm happy to provide. You agreed not to trouble my ship again. I always keep my word, sir. Look, we are nowhere near your vessel. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. I read your thesis. I wouldn't have wanted you if you weren't the best. Where are we going? Ten-forward. We're going to forget about work, sit, talk, relax, look at the stars. You need to learn to slow down. No, I can't do that. You're awfully young to be so driven. Yes, I am. I had to be the best, because only the best get to be here. Geordi... Lieutenant... It's OK. Go on. Whatever is out here, we'll be the first humans to see it. I want to be a part of that, I want to understand it. Sonya, relax. You're here. You've made it. But you won't last long, banging into walls. Itll be there for you, believe me. OK. I promise I won't let anything exciting go by without telling you. OK. Bridge, this is ten-forward. Guinan? You've never called the bridge before. Is everything alright? How do you mean? Is anything unusual happening? Nothing out of the ordinary. Why do you ask? I'm not sure. It's just a feeling. I've had it before. It's probably nothing. Forget that I called. Ten-forward out. The locator beam won't help. They'll never look this far away. Enterprise, this is Picard. Stop this foolishness, Q. Return me. You should change your attitude. Petulance ill becomes you. We have business, Picard. Keeping me prisoner will not compel me to discuss anything. It will in time. I appreciate your advice, Lieutenant. I'll take it to heart. Guinan? Can I get you something? We're fine. Is everything alright? I don't know. I'll check out Engineering. I'll go with you. Where is the Captain? In his quarters? Captain, this is Counsellor Troi. Computer, locate Capt Picard. The Captain is not aboard. Commander, there is a shuttle missing from bay two. All stop. Answering all stop, sir. I have hailed the shuttle on all frequencies. No response. Sensors indicate no shuttle or other ships in this sector. Let's assume the Captain is aboard that shuttle. How could he leave without us knowing? Impossible. Take it easy, Wes, we'll find him. Begin a search. Worf? Set sensors on maximum scan. Data, use our present location as a centre. Plot a search pattern from these coordinates to cover the most area in the least time. Search pattern input, sir. Engage, Mr Crusher. First Officer's log, stardate 42761.3. We have not determined why or how Capt Picard left the Enterprise. We are not sure he is in the missing shuttle, although that is our assumption. For the last six hours, we have searched without success. We have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a ship without warp drive could cross in the given time. Widen the area. Do we stay out here years? Decades? I am ageless, Picard. You are not. The Enterprise will continue with Riker as Captain. You are an impossibly stubborn human. Return me to my ship. If I do, will you agree to give my request a full hearing? You're right, Picard. This is the proper venue for our discussion. Commander, my status board indicates that the shuttle is back. Computer, locate Capt Picard. Capt Picard is in ten-forward. I knew it was you. You! Picard, if you had any sense, you would get her off your ship. If you like, I'd be more than pleased to expedite her departure. You know him? We have had some dealings. Those ""dealings"" were two centuries ago. This creature is not what she appears to be. She's an imp. Where she goes, trouble always follows. You speak of yourself, not Guinan. Guinan? Is that your name now? Guinan is not the issue, you are. We agreed you would stop meddling with us. And so I have. State your business. Out with it! I agree, Captain. Enough about this creature. She is diverting us from the purpose of my being here. Which is...? The redoubtable Cmdr Riker. And Microbrain. Growl for me. Let me know you still care. Worf... My purpose is to join you. As what? A member of crew. Willing and able. Ready to serve. This ship is already home for the indigent, the unwanted, the unworthy. Why not for a homeless entity? Homeless? The other members of the Q Continuum kicked you out? Not all the Q are alike. Some are almost respectable. Ready and willing... Able to serve... What would you do? Would you start as an ordinary crewman? What task is... too menial... for an entity? Sir, do you mock me? That is the last thing I would do. You are part of our charter. We seek out new life forms and you are one of the most unique. To learn about you is, frankly, provocative. But you're next of kin to chaos. Captain, at least hear my argument. After our last encounter, I was asked to leave the Q Continuum. Since then I've wandered vaguely, bored really, my existence without purpose. Then I remembered the good times with you. The good times? You tried us for the crimes of humanity. You were exonerated. Then you asked me to join the Q continuum. You should have taken up my offer. More and more I realize that here is where I want to be. Think of the advantages. Now, I neither expect nor require any special treatment. If necessary, although I can't imagine why, I will renounce my powers and become as weak, as incompetent as you all. No. No? Captain, in fairness, let me try. I deserve at least that much. You kidnapped the Captain... I add spice to your lives, and you complain. Where is your adventurous spirit? Picard, think of the possibilities. Simply speaking, we don't trust you. Maybe not, but you do need me. You are not prepared for what awaits you. How can we be prepared for that which we do not know? But we are ready to encounter it. Really? Yes. That's why we're out here. The arrogance... They don't have a clue as to what's out here. But they will learn, adapt. That is their greatest advantage. They are moving further than they should. By whose calculations? You judge yourselves against the pitiful adversaries you've met so far. The Romulans, the Klingons... They are nothing compared to what's waiting. Picard, you are about to move into areas of the galaxy containing wonders more incredible than you can possibly imagine. And terrors to freeze your soul. I offer myself as a guide, only to be rejected out of hand. We'll do our best without you. What justifies that smugness? Not smugness, not arrogance. We are resolute, we are determined... ..and your help is not required. We'll just see how ready you are. Q! Bridge, this is the Captain. All stop. Answering all stop, sir. Status? According to coordinates, we have travelled 7,000 light years and are located near the system J-25. Travel time to the nearest starbase? At maximum warp, in two years, seven months, three days, 18 hours, we would reach Starbase 185. Why? Why? To give you a taste of your future, a preview of things to come. Con permiso, Capitán. The hall is rented, the orchestra engaged. It's now time to see if you can dance. Guinan, your people have been in this part of the galaxy. Yes. What can you tell us? Only that if I were you, I'd start back now. Captain's log, stardate 4276 1.9 Despite Guinan's warning, I feel compelled to investigate this unexplored sector of the galaxy before heading back. Captain, the sixth planet in the system is Class-M. It has roads, indicating a highly industrialized civilization. But where there should be cities there are great rips in the surface. It is as if all machine elements were scooped off the planet's face. It is identical to what happened to the outposts of the Neutral Zone. Captain, we are being probed. What is the source of the probe? A ship. On an intercept course. On screen. Magnify. Full scan. Go to yellow alert. Yellow alert. Keep the shields down. We don't want to seem provocative. Mr Data, what can you tell us? The ship is strangely generalized in design. There is no specific bridge, no command centre. There is no engineering section. I can identify no living quarters. Life signs? There is no indication of life. Lt Worf, what is its alert status? I detect no shields, no weapons of any known design. Hailing frequencies. Open. This is Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise. No response. This is Capt Picard, representing the United Federation of Planets. Guinan. Activate your screen and monitor this. I may need your input. I'm here, Captain. View screen is activated. I have the other ship. You know this life form? Yes. My people encountered them a century ago. They destroyed our cities, scattered my people throughout the galaxy. They're called the Borg. Protect yourself, Captain, or they will destroy you. Shields up. Aye, sir. All decks stand by. Security, come to Main Engineering. We have an intruder. Lieutenant? Status? It made a visual survey of the engine core, sir, then moved in here. Interesting, isn't it? Not a he, not a she. Not like anything you've ever seen. An enhanced humanoid. What is it you want? We mean you no harm. Do you understand me? Understand you? You're nothing to him. He's not interested in your life form. He's the first of many scouts, here to analyze your technology. He may attempt to gain control of the ship. I wouldn't let him. Stop. I cannot allow you to interfere with the operation of this ship. Mr Worf. Ensign. Use whatever means to neutralize the invader. Because her people had contact with the Borg, I have asked Guinan along. You are aware of what occurred in Main Engineering? Yes. What happened between your people and the Borg? I wasn't there personally. But from what I'm told, ... ..they swarmed through our system. And when they left, there was little or nothing left of my people. If they were that aggressive, why didn't the Borg attack when they could? They don't attack individually. It's not their way. When they decide to come, they'll come in force. They don't do anything piecemeal. The initial encounter was solely to gather information? Yes. How do we reason with them, let them know we're no threat? You don't. At least, I've never known anyone who did. Captain, we are being hailed. On screen. This is Capt Jean-Luc Picard... Your defensive capabilities are unable to withstand us. If you defend yourselves, you will be punished. Counsellor? We're not dealing with an individual mind. They have no single leader. It is the collective minds of them all. That would have definite advantages. One leader can make mistakes. It's far less likely in a combined whole. Picard... Are you sure you don't want me as a member of your crew? Captain, the Borg have locked on to us with a tractor beam. We're on our way. Report, Lieutenant. The beam is draining our shields. We'll be helpless. Warp eight, any heading. Engage. Captain, the beam is holding us. Increase power. Shields weakening. Shields will be down in 18 seconds. Locate tractor beam source. Lock on phasers. Fire. They still have us. Shields are down, sir. A laser beam is slicing into the saucer section. Carving us up like a roast. Use whatever force necessary. Terminate the beam. Fire when ready. Again, Mr Worf. Tractor beam released, sir. Force field maintaining our hull integrity. Damage report? Coming in, sir. Sections 27, 28 and 29 on decks four, five and six destroyed. Casualties? 18 were in that section and are missing. What is the condition of the alien ship? They have sustained damage to 20 percent of their vessel. Life support is minimal. Conference. I can't get the shields up. Divert power from anywhere but life support. It wouldn't help. The circuits that control the shields are fused. If you can't reprogram, reroute. 18 people... Dead, just like that. I know. Put it out of your head. No, I can't, I keep seeing them. Sonya, stop. We can grieve later. Let's get these shields operative. Right, of course. Guinan, how much more can you tell us about these creatures? Bits and pieces. Anything would help. They're made up of organic and artificial life which has been developing for thousands of centuries. The Borg is the ultimate user. They're unlike any threat your Federation has ever faced. They're not interested in political conquest, wealth or power as you know it. They're interested in your ship, its technology. They have identified it as something they can consume. You brought us here, exposed us to it and cost us the lives of our shipmates. Oh, please... Number One... 18 of our people have died. Please, tell us this is one of your illusions. No. This is as real as your so-called life gets. This is Lt La Forge, Captain. We've been able to restore power to the shields. Very good. Captain, casualty list coming on screen. Cancel. We'll deal with that later. Sir, if we're to have any further dealings with the Borg, we should find out all we can about them. Visit the ship? I believe that's the only choice. Assemble a minimal away team. What? Mr Worf, transporter room three. Data. I wouldn't go there, if I were you. They paid us a visit. It seems only fair to return the courtesy. Captain's log, supplemental. We have been attacked by an alien race which Guinan calls the Borg. We seem to have neutralized their vessel. Cmdr Riker is leading an away team to try to learn more about them. There are no life-sign readings. I'll set you down in the least damaged section of the Borg ship. Set phasers on stun. Be ready to increase power if we need it. Energize. I wonder why they don't react. Or why we read no life signs. Especially with so many of them. We scanned for individual life. Apparently, in these slots, they become a part of the whole and no longer read as separate life forms. Captain? Go ahead, Number One. Our readings were incorrect. The Borg crew survived. They are in some kind of stasis. Explain. There are slots along the wall, compartments, with two Borg in each. Captain, I theorize that they are interconnected through these slots and are working collectively. We'll access their main computer. Commander, I believe each slot is designed for a specific Borg. Here is where the connection is made. Like a juggernaut, it could begin moving at any moment. The technology behind this biological and artificial interface is beyond our capabilities. There are many advantages. Speed being the most obvious. This ship literally thinks what it wants, then it happens. Fascinating. They either don't see us or don't see us as a threat. Transporter Chief. O'Brien here, Captain. If your fix on the away team wavers, beam them back at once. Count on it, sir. Captain, this is incredible. We've entered what appears to be the Borg nursery. Describe it. It looks as if the Borg are born as a biological life form. It seems that almost immediately after birth, they begin artificial implants. Apparently, they have the technology to link artificial intelligence directly into the humanoid brain. Astounding. Commander? What is it? The ship seems to be regenerating. This may explain why they have taken no notice of us. Their effort is being directed into repairing this vessel. Captain, the Borg seem to be using their combined power to repair the ship. Transporter Chief, beam the away team to the bridge. Let's get the hell out of here. Warp eight. Mr Crusher, engage. Captain, the Borg are in pursuit. On screen. Magnify. Increase to ten to the third power. It's continuing to regenerate. Let's see if we can outrun them. Mr La Forge, maximum warp for as long as we can hold it. Yes, sir. We are now passing warp 8.5. 8.8. Warp nine. Arm photon torpedoes. Let's try to slow them down. Torpedoes armed. Fire. They had no effect. We are now at warp 9.65. The Borg are still gaining. They will follow you until you exhaust your fuel. They will wear down your defences. Then you will be theirs. Admit it, Picard, you should have stayed where you belonged. Captain's log, supplemental. We are unable to maintain the gap from the Borg ship. Engineering to bridge. Go ahead. That's all we can give you. I understand. Captain, they are firing on us. No reports of any damage to the Enterprise. Captain, the target was not the ship. The weapon was designed to drain the shields. Confirmed. Shield effectiveness has been reduced 12 percent. Captain, the Borg ship is closing. They're firing again. Shields reduced 41 percent. Another hit and we will be defenceless. Arm photon torpedoes. Torpedoes armed. Fire photons. The Borg ship was not damaged. You can't outrun or destroy them. Damage them and their essence remains. They regenerate and keep on. Eventually you will weaken. Your reserves will be gone. They are relentless. The Borg ship is firing. We have lost shields again. Captain, we've just lost the warp engines. Where's your stubbornness now, your arrogance? Do you still profess to be prepared for what awaits you? Borg ship re-establishing its tractor beam. Lock on photon torpedoes. Yes, sir. Without our shields, at this range it is probable a photon detonation could destroy the Enterprise. Prepare to fire. I'll be leaving now. You thought you could handle it, so handle it. Q, ... end this. Moi? What makes you think I'm inclined or capable to terminate this? If we all die, here, ... now, ... ..you will not be able to gloat. You wanted to frighten us. We're frightened. You wanted to show us that we were inadequate. For the moment, ... I grant that. You wanted me to say I need you. I need you. Position? 070, mark 63, sir. Back where we started. That was a difficult admission. Others would have been humiliated to say those words. Another man would have rather died. I understand what you've done here, Q. But the lesson could have been learned without losing 18 of my crew. If you can't take a bloody nose, go home and crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid. Mr Crusher, set course for the nearest starbase. Course laid in for Starbase 83, sir. Engage. Q set a series of events into motion, bringing your contact with the Borg much sooner than it should have come. Now, perhaps when you're ready, it might be possible to establish relations with them. But for now, for right now, ... ..you're just raw material to them. Since they are aware of your existence... They will be coming. You can bet on it. Maybe Q did the right thing for the wrong reason. How so? Well, ... ..perhaps what we most needed was a kick in our complacency, to prepare us for what lies ahead. "
S2E17,"Captain's log, stardate 42779.1. We're en route to the Epsilon IX Sector for an astronomical survey of a new pulsar cluster. In the meantime, Ensign Crusher will divert to Starbase 515 for Starfleet exams. This came in for you from Starfleet. Testing parameters? Do not be apprehensive. I found the Academy examinations quite elementary. You would. Your earlier results earned you a credit for your work here. Don't worry about it. Cadets are extremely competitive. You have the practical experience. Cmdr Riker is correct. The information imparted at the Academy is unquestionably vital for prospective Starfleet officers, but it requires a significant period of supplementary systems training and situational disciplines. Didn't I just say that? Yes, sir, but not quite as perspicuously. I will not have you telling me what course to set. As Chief Medical Officer, I am ordering you. Report to Starbase 515 now. Please! I feel fine. The truth is, you've ignored this far too long. This ship has a mission to carry out. An astronomical survey to be conducted by science officers. I was looking forward to seeing the Epsilon Pulsar Cluster myself. Then we'll perform the procedure here. Absolutely not! My staff and I are capable of giving you the replacement. That's not the point. It would be... It would be inappropriate for you to do the procedure. Capt Picard, I had no idea. You do have an ego, don't you? Meaning? You're concerned about your image. Don't worry. If you get yourself to Starbase 515, your image will be safe with me. Captain. Excuse me. Ensign. I'm told you're leaving for Starbase 515. Yes, sir. I was just going. I have business there. I shall accompany you. You will? I mean, yes, sir. Prepare shuttle for departure. Aye, sir. Something I can take care of for you on Starbase 515? Hardly, Number One. You'll miss the Epsilon survey. I'm well aware of that. You have the bridge. Carry on. Come. What is it, Number One? Anything wrong? This trip to Starbase 515 is rather unexpected. Ensign Crusher and I will rendezvous with you on your return. Forgive my saying so, sir, but you're being rather enigmatic. Call it Captain's privilege. I have complete security clearance. This has nothing to do with ship's business. Suffice it to say, it is strictly a matter of... image. Relax, you'll do fine on your exams. They don't worry me. It's Capt Picard. Why? He's not taking the exams. Just the two of us, in a shuttlecraft, for six hours. What am I going to talk to him about? Archaeology, semantics, literature, art. You could learn a lot from him. Capt Picard! Nice day for a little trip. Shuttle number two, ready for departure. The Enterprise is at impulse speed. You are cleared for takeoff. Data, didn't the Captain look forward to the mission to the Epsilon Pulsar Cluster? So he said. Then what would make him leave the ship now? Commander, receiving a mayday on all frequencies. Source? Rhomboid Dronegar Sector 006. Detail? Ship. Unidentified. Distress. Nothing more. Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar 006, warp seven. That would put us at considerable distance from Capt Picard. I know, Data. I know. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Entering Rhomboid Dronegar Sector 006. I have a ship on target path. Slow to impulse speed. Aye, sir. Viewer. Deploy shields, sir? Hold fast. Data? Basic early design. Capable of sub-light travel only. Sir, we are being hailed. On screen. Cmdr William Riker, USS Enterprise, responding to your distress signal. What is your problem? We are far from home. Aren't we all? But you sent out a mayday. Do you need help? We are Pakleds. Our ship is the Mondor. It is broken. We are far from home. We need help. So their rubber band broke, right? Sensors show engineering problems. Total guidance system failure, with less than 24 hours' reserve power. Maybe I can help. What brings you so far from home? We look for things. What were you looking for? Things we need. Can you be more specific? Things that make us go. We need help. What is the nature of your mission? We look for things. Did you hear an echo? I could get that ship going in no time. Sure? Yeah. Very well. Our Chief Engineer will beam over. Close. Commander? Do we truly need to send our Chief Engineer to them? They need our help. Why not give them the information they need to make their own repairs? Do you think they could handle our technical specifications? We know nothing about them. Acknowledged, Mr Worf. We have an obligation to render aid. Report to the transporter room with necessary gear. We need more information. Do you have anything else on them? They are quite a benign species. Don't they seem a little slow? They may merely have poor language skills. What about weapons? Scanners show limited armaments. I think we can relax, Mr Worf. They can't even move without our help. We have them outmanned and outgunned. ETA, 1330 hours, sir. It's not exactly warp speed. More like a late-22nd-century interplanetary journey. Sir? You should read more history, Ensign. Yes, sir. A complete waste of time. Pardon? I shouldn't be taking this trip. I should be on the Enterprise. Why are you coming with me to Starbase 515, sir? Well, it's certainly not my idea. I'm sorry, Ensign. I didn't mean to take it out on you. I just hate the prospect of another damned cardiac replacement. Cardiac replacement? I didn't know. Well, now you do. A parthenogenic implant? What else would it be? My heart was... injured. A replacement was necessary. That would have been it, except that the replacement is faulty. Why would anyone use a faulty replacement? Just pilot the shuttle, Ensign. Wait a minute, it's OK. I'm... here to help. We are far from home. Who's in charge of Engineering? My friend. His name is Reginold. Could I meet him? He is Reginold. I think you mentioned that. We look for things. So I've heard. Can you make our ship go? Yes. I think so. We look for things to make us go. Fellas, why don't you just show me where your guidance system is, OK? Excuse me. He is smart. Commander? Lt La Forge is on an alien ship? Yes. We're assisting some curious throwbacks. How they ever mastered space travel is a curiosity. Commander, those aliens, what they feel is not helplessness. Lt La Forge is in great danger! He's in danger. Great danger. Can you be more specific? It's not our help they want. Our help is all they'll get. They can't use force, can they? You think they're weak. Look at them. They're not Jarada or Romulan. Our Betazoid Counsellor is aware of things beyond our perceptions. Van Doren's technique has been perfected to 2.4 percent. Sir? The cardiac-replacement procedure, it has a very low mortality rate. 2.4 percent. Those are pretty good odds. Just not overly thrilled at having my innards becoming the subject of Starfleet gossip. Of course not, sir. Why didn't you just have Dr Pulaski perform the operation? I'm sure you could have trusted her to keep it quiet. Let's say I have personal reasons and leave it at that, shall we? The power needs to be rerouted through this venturi chamber before it can be channelled to the engine's coils. It is broken. Yeah, but not for long. See, we are going to reconfigure these separators, here, and... over here. Lt La Forge? This is Cmdr Riker. Yes, Commander? Go ahead. Are you alright? Sure. Why do you ask? Counsellor Troi has expressed misgivings about your absence. There's nothing to worry about. Understood. Once you complete the repairs, get back here. Yes, sir. I should be done momentarily. You see? Like that. There. Your guidance is now up and running. Main power failure? Will our ship go now? Your guidance is operational, but you're not going anywhere, not with a main power failure. It is broken. Can you make it go? Cmdr Riker? I have a problem. On screen. It looks like this will take longer than I anticipated. I guess you'd prefer Cmdr Riker as a travelling companion. What? It's OK. You're not too comfortable with me. I understand. Ensign... Wesley, that's not true. You're a fine young man. You don't have to say that, sir. It's pretty obvious how you feel. Is it? How so? Everyone knows. You don't like kids. That's too bad. You'd have made a good father. Thank you. Didn't you ever wish you had kids of your own? Wishing for a thing does not make it so. We send him to do one repair, now they need him for more. Apparently, their ship is quite fragile. This is Riker on the Enterprise. Almost got it, Commander. We look for things. Apparently your ship is in need of more than minor repair. Things to make it go. We will tow you to a nearby base. He can make it go. But we need our Chief Engineer back on our ship. He is smart. All done, Commander. Prepare to beam over. Yes, sir. You are good. We aim to please. We need you. I'm flattered. Fellas, I hate to repair and run, but if you'll excuse me. One to beam aboard! Don't! Transporter room, beam him back! Negative response, sir. Try again! Negative response. The Pakled ship has a shield up. A shield? What kind? It seems beyond their technology. Similar to Romulan shields. Do not interfere with our transporter beam. Drop your shields. Status? Viewer transmission terminated... and blocked. Hail on all frequencies. Running frequency search. Negative, sir. They're ignoring us. Apparently so. Shields up. Shields up. Sensors at maximum sensitivity. Sensors at maximum. Phasers ready, sir. Care for some coffee, Ensign? No, thank you, sir. How about a sandwich? I don't think so, sir. Come on, it's been hours. You must be hungry. Thank you, sir. Here. Were you ever married? Never had the time. Don't you ever get lonely? For ambitious Starfleet officers, there are certain costs involved. One must be cautious of long-term commitments, Wesley. No problem. Where women are concerned, I am in complete control. Really? I always rather had to work at that. Were you always so disciplined? Good Lord, no. If I was, I wouldn't have this problem. I don't understand. Well... I was a young Starfleet officer, not much older than you are now. Top of my Academy class. Green as hell. And, oh, so cocky. Too cocky, as it turned out. What happened? Several friends and I were on leave at Farspace Starbase Earhart. It was little more than a galactic outpost in those days. Before the Klingons joined the Federation? That's right. Well, my mates and I were at the Bonestell Recreation Facility, which was something of a dead-rough crossroads at the time, filled with an assorted bunch of galactic riffraff. A trio of Nausicaans came in, clearly spoiling for a confrontation with a group of fresh-faced Starfleet officers like ourselves. Well, everyone had the good sense to give these Nausicaans a wide berth, to stand off. Everyone, that is, except me. I stood toe to toe with the worst of them. I told him what I thought of him, his pals, his planet, and I possibly made a reference to his questionable parentage. And the next thing I knew, all three were on me and I was fighting for my life. I was actually doing quite well for a while. You fought them... and won? I had this one Nausicaan down in this somewhat devious joint-lock, when, unbeknownst to me, one of his chums drew his weapon and... impaled me through the back. Curious sensation, actually. Not much pain. Shock, certainly, at the sight of serrated metal sticking through my chest. A certain giddy warmth. In fact, I do actually remember that I laughed out loud. Well, it pierced my heart, of course. If we had not been so near to a medical facility, I'd have died. Really? Then what happened? Nothing. I was no hero, Wesley. I was an undisciplined, loudmouthed, opinionated young man who was way out of his league. I learned a very hard, very painful lesson that day. But I learned it well. I hope you never learn it the same way. Care for another sandwich? Please. Come on, Data. I am programming the comm system to scan interference patterns. A full analysis will take time. You be careful with that thing. You want to hurt us. What? I came here to help you. We can make more. Make more weapons. Wait a minute. You have a replicator? It is not broken. I didn't come to give you weapons! You will make more. Commander, a photon torpedo may penetrate their shield. Any hostile move could jeopardize Geordi. Agreed. But what do the Pakleds want? Counsellor? They have what they want. For now. We're approaching Starbase 515, sir. At last. Did you read that book I gave you? Some of it. That's reassuring. I just don't have much time. There is no greater challenge than the study of philosophy. But William James won't be in my Starfleet exams. Important things never will be. Anyone can be trained in the mechanics of piloting a starship. But Starfleet Academy... It takes more. Open your mind to the past. Art, history, philosophy. And all this may mean something. All deception. Nothing the Pakleds have said or done has been sincere. Intensified scan shows their guidance system to be intact. As is their power generator. Then what was Geordi repairing? The putative malfunctions were programmed into their computer. I never knew they had that technology. They seem to have made some technological leaps forward. Why go through the charade of needing our help? For the sole purpose of making Lt La Forge their prisoner. Captain's personal log, stardate 42779.5. We have arrived at Starbase 515. I am still quite uneasy, despite assurances that this medical procedure poses little risk. I hope you won't be late for your exams. I still have some time, sir. Why do I get the distinct impression you're acting as some kind of escort? Dr Pulaski asked me to make sure that you actually went inside. That woman. She would. Sir? What is it, Ensign? I enjoyed our trip together, sir. So did I. They are initiating visual contact. Now we'll see what they want. Enterprise. We demand that you return our crew member immediately. Request denied. Lower your shields! Request denied. Stop it! What do you want? You think we are not smart. I think you need to continue to develop. We are smart. Prove it! Return our man to us. You want him? Yes, damn it! Good. We want all computer information from your ship. Now! We have a man held hostage and all I have are no-option options. I need some input. Is Geordi alright? He's been hit by multiple phaser stuns. He may need medical attention. Security are ready to take the initiative, sir. Data? Our options have not changed. We can either respond to the Pakled demand or not. We can either use force or not. Access to our computer is a breach of Starfleet security. Then force it must be. Don't worry, Captain. We've done this a hundred times. We're ready when you are. Get on with it, Doctor, I have work to do. Activate sterile field. Neural callipers. This is a secondary cardiac procedure, with mid-line entry and excision of the early model unit. I anticipate no complications. The patient has had positive primary results, and shows extraordinary physical condition. We'll all be home in time for dinner. Tissue mitigator. There is limited information on the Pakled culture, but their eclectic equipment suggests their technology comes from others. And now they've become militant. So it seems. Rationale? They are unwilling to wait for the timely evolution of their intellectual capacity. They want instant knowledge, instant power and gratification. The more they get, the more they want. And the more dangerous they become. It's time we set some limits. To what effect? We are faced with an impossible conundrum. Why not turn their impatience and greed against them? But how? Geordi could give them something they want. Something important. Then we create the moment for him to take it away and get him outta there. Would you be suggesting a ruse? I would. But what if we fail? What'll happen to Geordi then? We have no other choice. We have to try. There's been some capillary reaction here. Let's proceed carefully. We'll need sharper focus on the thoracic polychromatics and verification of myocardial enzyme balance. Let me talk to him. I'll get you their computer banks. We wanna be smart. So open the hailing frequency. They'll listen to me. We are smart. We need their computer things. Yes. Cmdr Riker? Yes, Lieutenant, we're here. The Pakleds seem pretty... sincere. We want what we want. Our computers are non-negotiable. We want them. Believe me, they're nothing if not... persistent. We want to be nothing if not persistent. Nobody calls them great conversationalists! Where did they get their shields? Yes. We like shields. From what I've seen, half the systems on board have been stolen from the Romulans, Klingon, Jarada, almost anyone they've ever had contact with. We like to be smart. Confirmed, Lt La Forge. They steal technology. But they lack the ability to use it properly. You're an excellent Chief Engineer, Lt La Forge. Thank you, sir. And your knowledge of phaser and photon weaponry is unmatched. Nice of you to say so, sir, but, really, Lt Worf is... Our missions are always inherently dangerous. Any of us could be called on to make the ultimate sacrifice at any time. Yes, sir, but... Speaking of time, this may be your time. I shall personally miss you. Goodbye, Geordi. I shall miss you at weapons systems analysis. I guess you'll just have to... arm your photon torpedoes without me. As well as our hydrogen collectors. Fond farewell. He knows about weapons. You can make us strong. It's not something I like to talk about. Any classified-weapons knowledge shared with them will be treason. But I may have no choice. You will die without honour. Thanks a lot, Worf. You will never attain the 24th level of awareness. 24? That's quite a challenge. Indeed. 24 is the gateway to heroic salvation. Do you think he understands? He'd better. He's afraid. We all are, Counsellor. You are smart. Not smart enough. I'm still here. Make us strong. You wanted me to help you go. Let's work on that guidance system, OK? Make us strong, or die. It's not working. Something's wrong. The metabolation occlusions aren't holding. Damn it! I can't stop the heterocyclic declination! Fuse! Again! We need a biomolecular physiologist in here. This man is dying. Right away, sir. You've got to be kidding. Make us strong. There's not enough juice here to blow up a passing asteroid! Do it. Make us strong. I suppose we could increase the antimatter charges. Yes, we like power. Yeah. Do not try to trick us. We can tell. Metabolation? Negative. Heterocyclics? Failing. And capillary integrity too unpredictable to try a resect. You're unwilling to attempt it? I'm not qualified. I know someone who is. Can he do it? Geordi's an engineer, not a weapons specialist. If anyone can improvise, it's Geordi. Do the Pakleds have that kind of gear? Ongoing scanning indicates progressive weapons potential. The timing will be crucial. Geordi must interpret our intentions. Geordi's up to speed. I trust him. The Pakleds heard our fiction about his weapons knowledge. And as they equate intelligence with strength, they won't miss a chance to use that knowledge. Can you do it? Count on it. Bridge to Cmdr Riker. Go ahead, bridge. I am receiving an emergency summons from Starbase 515. Capt Picard is close to death. Be ready. We are strong! You are armed to the teeth. Teeth are for chewing. You have photon torpedo. You are strong. We are strong. We have power. Positive indication of armed photon torpedoes, Commander Geordi did it. Starbase request we proceed to base at warp nine. We've got to go. The Captain needs our help. We can't leave Geordi behind. I want the Pakleds on that screen. Now. Forced spectrum communication is spotty at best, sir. Do it! This is the Enterprise. Return our personnel or face reprisal. We are strong now. We have better weapons. Are you prepared to use them? We are a force now. We will have respect. Power. We don't have time for this. You want power? Here. Ensign Gomez. Ready. Prepare firing sequence. Start firing countdown from 24. I can't believe it. My friends are trying to kill us. Kill me! Believe it. They are violent. OK, they want to play rough, fine with me. Let me check something. Good. He is on our side now. Begin firing sequence. 24, 23, 22, 21, 20,... Firing sequence proceeding. Hold fast. 17, 16, 15,... Don't do anything yet. What are you doing? Checking your system is operative. We will attack. We are strong. nine, eight, seven, six, five... We should attack now. One second. We can't afford a misfire here. Hurry. Fire. Now. No, too late. We have fired. They will be destroyed. They used the crimson force field. It did not shoot. No, the crimson force field has disarmed us. They are smart. We are not strong. Drop your shields. Allow us to transport Lt La Forge immediately. Shields are down, sir. Beam one to the bridge. Set heading for Starbase 515, warp nine. That hydrogen exhaust sure put on a nice light show. Harmless, but effective. You disabled the photons? Just in time. That's why you're alive. Deactivating neural callipers. What the hell are you doing here? Saving your life. Come on. This is a routine procedure. Quite commonplace. True. But you are not a commonplace man. You'll be out of recovery in four hours. I didn't want you involved in this. You're welcome. If you're here, the entire crew must know. You're still the Captain. Invincible. Thank you. I beg your pardon? Seems things are back to normal. I'm pleased to report Ensign Crusher's exam results permit him to continue his studies on the Enterprise. Furthermore, any rumours of my brush with death are greatly exaggerated. Is that clear? Yes, sir. Then, Ensign Crusher, set course for the Epsilon Sector, warp five. Engage. "
S2E18,"Number One, join me in the ready room. Yes, sir. I've come from a meeting with Admiral Moore. He wanted to discuss... this. Recognize it? Sounds like an SOS. Good guess. You're quicker than Starbase research. They took hours to realize it was a distress beacon. When was it detected? Last month. Just kicked in without any warning. Who used the beacon? It's Terran. I'm familiar with most Earth codes and... Interesting. Yes. That code hasn't been used in centuries. What was its origin point? Ficus Sector. There's no record of an Earth colony there. Now we know someone's out there and they're asking for help. But who? Let's try and find out. Computer, download all information regarding signal beacon from Starbase mainframe. Distress beacon used by the European Hegemony. The European Hegemony? A loose alliance formed in the early 22nd century. The first stirrings of a world government. Read more history. Computer, locate the exact dates in which this signal beacon was in general use. Old Earth calendar, 2123 until 2190. No extraterrestrial source ever used this code? Negative. Computer, locate all Earth deep-space launches from 2123 to 2190, ... ..with the destination in or near the Ficus Sector. Working. Nothing for Ficus. Damn it, who's out there? Lost sheep. Let's see if we can find them. Medical emergency. Dr Pulaski to the bridge. What happened? He just collapsed, sir. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 42823.2. We're departing from Starbase 73 to investigate the source of the mysterious distress signal. Meanwhile, my Security Officer remains in sickbay, where Dr Pulaski is searching for the cause of his collapse. I'm fine. You're not. You fainted. I did not faint. Klingons do not faint. Excuse me. I'll rephrase. This Klingon suffered a dramatic drop in blood pressure. His blood glucose level dropped. There was deficient blood flow resulting from circulatory failure. In other words, he curled up his toes, and lay unconscious on the floor. Doctor, there is no need to insult me. Worf, I am worried. Now, something is wrong. Klingons don't faint. Forgive me. I can't think of another word. You're sick. Klingons do not yield to illness. Stay still. I have to check something with the computer. Lieutenant, you have rop'ngor. But that is a childhood ailment. Yes. How shall I live down the humiliation? Worf, you can't help... Still, for a warrior to find himself in such a situation. So you've got the Klingon version of the measles. How would Cmdr Riker feel if he had the measles? Pretty silly. Doctor, how is Lt Worf? He's in no danger. Worf was... just observing a Klingon ritual involving fasting. He didn't take into account that you must decrease physical activity as you decrease caloric intake. Pulaski out. Thank you. I am in your debt. Come. Captain, I've been considering the problem of the missing ship. The lack of any record of a launch to Ficus would not be unusual in the chaos of the early 22nd century, but someone loaded that ship. The manifest. Yes, sir. There it is. SS Mariposa. Loaded 27th November, 2123. Destination, Ficus Sector. Capt Walter Granger commanding. Mariposa. The Spanish word for butterfly. Thank you, Data. I thought it might be significant. It doesn't appear to be, Data. No, sir. You learn a lot from luggage. 225 computers, five monitor-beacon satellites, 700 cellular comlinks, 50 spinning wheels... Spinning wheels? Access. Cattle, chickens, pigs... A device used for spinning yarn which consists of a large wheel... Why would anyone carry such an insane mix of cargo? They were planning for the worst? Theorize, Data. Give me some background. In the early 22nd century, Earth was recovering from World War III. A major philosopher then was Liam Dieghan. He began the Neo-Transcendentalists, advocating return to a simpler life. One lived in harmony with nature and learned under her tutelage. Thank you, Data. But if this was a ship full of utopians, why carry all this technological baggage? I have insufficient information upon which to form a theory, sir. Doctor. I wished to thank you for protecting my... Your secret is safe with me. Worf, I am honoured. No one has ever performed the Klingon tea ceremony for me. There. That should do it. You know the ceremony? I understand the externals, not the mysteries. I'm not a Klingon. Do not drink the tea. It is deadly to humans. And none too good for Klingons. It is a test of bravery, of one's ability to look at mortality. It is also a reminder that death is an experience best shared. Like the tea. Worf, you're a romantic. It is among the Klingons that love poetry achieves its fullest flower. Hold that thought. Antidote. If we're going to share, let's share. Now, quote me a little of that poetry. Initiate sensor sweeps. Aye, sir. The system's sun has entered a period of severe flare activity. That explains the SOS. Class-M readings from the fifth planet in the system. Take us in. Shields at maximum. Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface. Hailing on all frequencies. No response, but the flares may interfere with communications. There's no evidence of an advanced communication network. Where's that technology they brought? There is no artificial power source on the planet. Stellar flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency. Computer projections indicate they will brush the planet in 3.6 hours. Evacuation will be difficult. We can lower shields for transport only between flares. Captain, these people have been isolated for 300 years. They could be very unsophisticated. The shock of being transported onto a spaceship could frighten them. Your point is well taken, Counsellor. Number One, you're going to have to go down there. On my way. Captain's log, stardate 42827.3. Cmdr Riker has reached the caverns, where he's making preparations for the evacuation. What's the situation, Number One? There are 200 people here. Their condition? Surprisingly good. Will they leave? Yes, but... Get them up here. I'm debating with their leader... No time, Number One. Initiate transport. But, sir... Any problems we'll address up here. Aye aye, sir, we're on our way. All of us. Riker out. First load ready, Mr O'Brien. Energizing. Captain, you'd better get somebody down here. Right away. Take the pig out now, will ya? Very good. O'Brien, that third wave should be ready. Aye, sir. O'Brien, is it? I should've known t'would be an Irishman running the ship. What the devil is going on here? Capt Picard, is it? The man who makes decisions for us without so much as a by-your-leave. This is my Security Chief, Lt Worf. I don't suppose security is a problem for you. Danilo Odell, sir, at your service. Why are these animals here? Sorry, sir. It was this or arguing till hell froze over. Capt Picard, sir, we can't leave our animals here to die. Besides, how could we build our future without our animals? Alright. Chief O'Brien, transport this group directly to cargo hold seven. And beam the remaining refugees from the planet directly to that hold. Right, lads. Everybody back onto the infernal machine. Alright, everybody up. Captain, t'was very good of you, sir, to rescue us from our troubles. My pleasure. You must be worth quite a bit to own a fine ship like this. I don't own the Enterprise. I command her. Whatever. Sir, would you happen to be married? No. Why? No. Well, you see, sir, I have a daughter. Felicitations. Would you be interested, sir? No. You're quite sure? Quite sure. He's quite sure. What's the total? 223. Count on two more in the next few days. Head for the nearest starbase. They were anachronistic in 2123. I wonder how they'll cope. They'll learn and adapt. Odell will be running this place within a week. Lt Worf here. Report. Fire in cargo hold seven. The Bringloidi. What have they done now? Keep the area clear. Report. Fire has been contained. No damage. Unseal the doors. My God, Picard, the place is a bloody deathtrap! Lightning bolts falling from the ceiling. What the hell was that thing? Automated fire system. A force field contains the flame until the remaining oxygen is used. What if I'd been under that thing? You would have been in the fire. Yeah, well, I mean what would have happened to me? You would have suffocated and died. Sweet mercy. There you are. Your hospitality leaves a hell of a lot to be desired. You don't offer us a bite or sup, and when we build a fire to cook, the place goes mad! I... My apologies. I was unaware that you had not been instructed in the use of the food dispensers. What are you staring at? Never seen a woman before? I thought I had. Commander, may I present my daughter? Brenna Odell. Pleased to meet you, ma'am. You may have all the time in the world, but I've got frightened children and women to care for. What about the men? I'm sure they'll find their comfort. In the bottom of a mug of brew! Pay no heed, Commander, she's a fine girl. She's not usually so sharp-tongued. Dado! Sir? That's the last thing I expected. Sometimes, Number One, you just have to... bow to the absurd. Captain, sir, how did the ship sense the fire? Well, the ship's computer... Computer? The ship's computers sense a localized increase... Men! Always talking when there's work to be done. Shouldn't you be flying this ship or whatever it is you do? Sir, I think I'll stay and help. That isn't necessary. The ship will clean itself. Well, good for the bloody ship. Tell me, Cmdr Riker, where does a girl go to wash her feet here? As First Officer, I feel it's my responsibility to show you all the amenities. She is much like a Klingon woman. Captain, there's just one other thing. It slipped my mind. The point, Mr Odell. Yeah. Well, in all your travels, have you heard anything from the other colony? The other colony? Captain's log, supplemental. Stellar charts reveal a Class-M planet only half a light year from the Bringloid system. I presume it was the destination of the colony which owned the sophisticated equipment. William Riker, you're a mess. You don't have to do that. If I don't, who will? I can see why your father wants to marry you off. And why is that? So he can have a pipe and a beer in peace. You've shown me so many wonders on your great ship, but there's one thing left. What's that? I'm still waiting to wash my feet. Right behind that door. William, is something wrong? What do you mean? Do you not like girls? Of course I do. Is there a special technique to this foot washing? You generally start at the top and work your way down. I think I can handle that. I was hoping you might. You sent for me? Yes... Now, we're brewing poteen, but we need to find a way to heat it without this bloody ship firing bloody lightning bolts at us. You can get spirituous liquor from the food dispensers. It's not that synthehol bilge O'Brien offered me, is it? No. If you wish, it can be real alcohol. Good. With all the deleterious effects. As it should be. You see, lad, every moment of pleasure in life has to be purchased by an equal moment of pain. Whiskey. Terrible. It has no bite. Chech'tluth. Now that's what I call a wee drop of the creature. Father! Remember what I said about the moment of pain? 'Tis about to begin. Hello, my darlin'. My darlin', is it? I might've known. Can you still talk to Dr Pulaski about the children? What about them? She wants to send them to school. What do you think? I think it's a good idea. So go handle it! And I'm sure there's something you can be doing with your time. And as for you! What? Why tell them this magic wall gives more than meat and potatoes? Now they'll never work. Madam, have you ever considered a career in security? If it's like baby-sitting, I'm an expert. Captain's log, supplemental. We are approaching the Class-M planet where we hope to find the other colonists. Signal from the planet, Captain. On screen. This is Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise, from the United Federation of Planets. This is wonderful. Welcome, Captain. I am Wilson Granger, Prime Minister of Mariposa. No doubt a descendant of Capt Walter Granger. Not quite a descendant. We feared Earth had met disaster when no one came for us. I'm afraid the truth is you got lost in the bureaucracy. But despite the lateness of our arrival, we're here now and eager to renew ties. Splendid. Please come down and allow us to extend our hospitality to you and your crew. Thank you. Form an away team, Number One. I would urge caution. Caution? What's wrong? He's hiding something. We'll check it out. Mr Worf? Dr Pulaski, come to transporter room three for an away detail. Welcome to Mariposa. I'm Victor Granger, Minister of Health. Cmdr William Riker. Dr Pulaski. Lt Worf. A pleasure. I'll escort you to the Prime Minister. This way, please. Twin brothers? Your arrival is serendipitous. How so? Well, ... perhaps I'll let the Prime Minister explain that. Triplets? Worf, there is something damn odd going on here. Quadruplets. Doctor, is your title scientific or medical? Medical. Excellent. Is there some medical problem we should know about? I think it best if the... Prime Minister explains. I thought you might. Yes. Excuse me. Gentlemen? Please, follow me. This way. Doctor. Welcome to Mariposa. Dr Katherine Pulaski. My Chief of Staff, Elizabeth Vallis. Tell me, is your entire population made up of clones, Prime Minister? Clones? Clones? Clones. Captain's log, supplemental. Prime Minister Granger desires an urgent meeting to discuss the future of the Mariposan colony. I've invited him to the Enterprise. Captain, we need your help. 300 years ago, during our landing on Mariposa, the skin of our ship was breached. Only five of the colonists survived. The progenitors weren't willing to just give up and die, and they were scientists... So, they used that expertise and turned to cloning. Yes. We had no other option. Two women and three men were an insufficient gene pool from which to build a society. How did you suppress the natural sexual drive? Drugs? Punitive laws? In the beginning, a little bit of each. Now, after 300 years, the entire concept of sexual reproduction is repugnant to us. How did you overcome the problem of replicative fading? We haven't. You have got a problem. I don't understand replicative fading. Each time you clone, you make a copy of a copy. Errors creep in. Eventually you get a nonviable clone. How can we help you? We need an infusion of fresh DNA. I was hoping you would be willing to share some tissue samples. You want to clone us? Yes. No way, not me. How could you possibly be harmed? It's not a question of harm. One William Riker is... unique, perhaps even special. But a hundred of him diminishes me in ways I can't even imagine. You would be preserving yourself. Human beings have other ways of doing that. We have children. I think you will find that attitude prevalent among all the Enterprise people. I see. Well, ... if you are not willing to share your DNA, can your people help repair our malfunctioning equipment? Of course. Number One, put a team together. Let's start. Yes, sir. La Forge, gather a technical support away team in transporter room three. Captain, with your permission, may I return to the planet? It could be my last chance to study replicative fading. With your permission, Mr Prime Minister. You are welcome. Perhaps you will find a solution we've overlooked. I appreciate the compliment, but I don't think that's very likely. And repairing that equipment will certainly not solve your problems. What other solution do we have? Doctor, remember, there are only five of us. Captain's log, supplemental. Cmdr Riker and Dr Pulaski have returned to Mariposa with a team of Enterprise technicians. We're almost finished. I wish there was more we could do. Are you sure you won't reconsider? About the cloning? Out of the question. Excuse me, sir, I was... I was looking for Cmdr Riker. I'm afraid I haven't seen him. Dr Pulaski? Sorry, I can't help. I'll just have to hunt for them. Sorry to disturb you. What happened to you two on Mariposa? Everything alright? Any reason it shouldn't be? Whenever I asked where you were, they lied. Lied? With this I can see better than most people. If someone lies, there are physiological manifestations. Variations in blush response, pupil dilation, pulse, breath rate. It's hard with aliens, but humans? Got 'em nailed. They lied about our whereabouts? I don't remember anything happening. I was working and got a call to report to Granger's office. I ran into Will... Wait a minute. Granger said he hadn't seen either of you. Did you make it to his office? I think... I don't remember. What's the prognosis? Geordi, you're not missing any epithelial cells. Great. Will and l, however, are. Meaning? While you can clone from any cell, those lining the stomach are best as they are undifferentiated. Where're you going? The cloning lab. Stop! Murderers. Like hell. Damn thief! Gentlemen, please. What else could we do? We asked for your help and you refused us. We're desperate. That gave you the right to rob us? We have the right to survive. Doctor, how desperate is the colony's situation? In two or three generations the fading will be terminal. They're among the walking dead now. They're just unburied. I want their equipment inspected. Who knows what else they stole. We have a right to exercise control over our own bodies. You'll get no argument from me. I know the Mariposan culture seems alien, even frightening, but really, we have much in common. They're humans fighting for survival. Would we do less? Are you saying we should give them the DNA? That's just postponing the inevitable. If they get an infusion of fresh DNA, in 15 generations they'll go back to the same problems. Cloning isn't the answer. What they need is breeding stock. The Bringloidi. Yes. They have energy and drive, the clones have the emotional maturity and technical knowledge. They started out together. It seems only... fitting they end up together. It's a match made in heaven. It will have to be a shotgun wedding. Captain, it's out of the question. You're trying to dump your problems on us. Don't you understand? The Bringloidi can help you. Look at him. How could we ever integrate that into our society? You're no prize yourself. Primitive, hostile, disruptive. It would require enormous efforts to even educate them. Forget it, Capt Picard. I'm not coming, hat in hand, begging charity from this blatherskite. Stop! I will not allow posturing and bigotry to destroy this meeting. Now, please, sit down. Now, ... Cmdr Riker has asked that your laboratories be inspected for stolen tissue samples. I understand his concern. We may have to transport all your equipment to the Enterprise. I see. When reason fails, you'll resort to blackmail. Fine. Destroy yourselves. It's not so bad. In 50 years, we'll have a Class-M planet, ready for colonisation. You see, the end is closer than you like to think. I don't know. There are so many difficulties. Look, man, we are decent, hard-working people. We're willing to learn. They're so different. It is the differences that have made us strong. For 300 years, we have denied the carnal side of our nature. How can we learn to put that aside? Well, you put a young couple together... ..and you let nature take its course. For this to work, you'll have to alter your society, too. Monogamous marriage will not be possible for several generations. I don't quite understand. 30 couples are enough to create a viable genetic base. But the broader the base, the healthier the society. So it will be best if each woman, Bringloidi and Mariposan, had at least three children by three different men. I think I could handle that, yes. God, it's so... Frightening? Repugnant. So, it's a done deal. And here's my hand on it. Now, let's go and stake out my three women. Send in the clones. I must be out of my mind. Starfleet will probably agree with you. Excuse me, sir. Captain. Thank you, sir. Brenna... Brenna. A word. Isn't that just like a man? Make grandiose decisions and never consider the poor women. Miss Odell, I... You men draw a mug and solve your problems as the beer goes down, but when it comes to the practical matters, it always falls to women to make your dreams come true. Miss Odell, you wanted a new home. I don't know if I want to be Eve. It's your choice. If you wish, we will drop you off at a starbase, and you can go where you wish. Leave my da? If this is going to work, these people will need your strength, your guidance. Damn. What does he do again? Prime Minister. Sounds important. It is. So he might have more than two coins to rub together. Three husbands? "
S2E19,"Captain's log, stardate 42859.2. We're in orbit around Antede III, awaiting two dignitaries. Our mission is to escort them to a conference on Pacifica, where they will have the chance to join the Federation. You may find this interesting, Mr Crusher. Few humans have seen an Antedean in the flesh. Welcome. I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. Are they alright, sir? Yes. This is their preferred way of space travel. Their physical condition is good, considering the circumstances. It is a self-induced catatonic state, their way of dealing with the trauma of space flight. Will we try to revive them? No. Not until we reach the conference, three days from now. Have you prepared a sickbay facility for our guests? It needs some adjustments. Their physiology is unusual. You can store them for a few hours? I'll keep them out of the way. Mr Worf, provide security. Aye, sir. What's in that container? Vermicula. It's their food. When they come out of stasis, they'll be hungry. They eat this? In great quantities. What a handsome race. What did you think of the Antedeans, Wesley? They are... rather strange-looking, Commander. Judging a being by its appearance is the last major human prejudice. Your point is well taken, Mr Data. I'm sure they find us unattractive. We are being hailed by a small transport vessel, just coming into range. My God... What's the problem? What's she doing here? On screen, Captain. Enterprise, come in. We have you on viewer, pilot. Enterprise, I have a passenger. A VIP passenger who... Let me talk. I'm sure I'm more articulate. Mother. Captain, we're receiving Starfleet orders granting... Lwaxana Troi, Daughter of the Fifth House, Holder of the Sacred Chalice of Rixx, Heir to the Holy Rings of Betazed. Full ambassadorial status, sir. Back into your dress uniform, sir. And yours, Commander. She is listed as representing Betazed at the conference. Mother, please, don't do this to me. Do what, little one? Jean-Luc. What naughty thoughts. But how wonderful you still think of me like that. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. It's so like my mother to do the unexpected. It will be... pleasant to have her as a guest of the Enterprise again. Energize. Legs. Where are the legs? Where they belong, Mother. Right under you. I hate that. I'll never completely trust this device, Jean-Luc. Capt Picard, Mother. Explain to her. I'm sorry they startled you, Mrs Troi. They're Antedean delegates. Delegates. Last time I saw something like that, it was on a plate. Darling... Jean-Luc, I wasn't aware you had such handsome legs. My valet is waiting. You may beam him aboard now. You remember Mr Homn, of course? It would be hard to forget him. I keep him despite the outlandishly lustful thoughts he spews at me. Put that down, Homn. We can't deny the Captain the honour of carrying my belongings. I will not interfere with Mr Homn's duties this time. That's not what you're really thinking. You forget I'm a telepath. Mrs Troi, since this is obviously significant to you, ... ..Ill... I'll carry it. Just down this corridor. He has nice legs, too, little one. Is he still yours? Humans no longer own each other that way. Really? That's a custom we may have to introduce again. Thank you. Glad to help. I trust you will be comfortable. If you'll excuse me... I am serving a Betazoid dinner of greeting tonight, Captain. It is an ambassadorial function. It sounds delightful. He's a fine man. Solid, reliable. He's a little bit on the stuffy side, but, all in all, he's not that bad. Mother, you sound like you're sizing up a commodity. But that's exactly what men are, darling. Especially human men. Was your father ever unhappy with me? No. He worshipped you. But I'll never learn to see men the way you do. You will as you mature, darling. And the men in your life are going to bless you for it. You are so beautiful. She actually complimented Capt Picard on his legs? I'd expect a telepath to be more discreet. The opposite. She knows your mind, and lets you know what's on hers. Gentlemen. We must not lose sight of the fact that we are talking about someone with ambassadorial rank. Even though she may appear... somewhat eccentric, Lwaxana Troi must be treated with appropriate respect. Understood? Picard to Pulaski. Yes, sir? When did you last look in on the Antedean guests? Doing so right now, Captain. Are they still catatonic? Status of the beings is unchanged. Pulse, still steady. Respiration, ... normal for them. Understood. Keep me informed. Picard out. I'll be in my quarters. It will be a dress-uniform dinner, gentlemen. Sir? To which dinner was the Captain referring, sir? Nothing I've been invited to. Any of you? Very interesting. Doctor? You're not attending dinner with the rest of us this evening? I've already eaten, but thanks, Captain. I seem to be a little early. I'm sure the others will be here soon. The other officers, Riker, Counsellor Troi...? Hello, Jean-Luc. So glad you could come. A toast to Earthmen, who, despite their many faults, have that unique ability to charm women of all races, in all corners of the galaxy. Speaking on behalf of men of Earth, which is indeed an awesome responsibility, I thank you. I know what you're thinking. You do? You're wondering if I'm seeing any other man. On a serious basis. Well, actually, I wasn't... Don't worry about it, Jean-Luc. Competition seems to bring out the best in the human male. The fact is, I... I was not expecting this... this setting. I assumed my senior officers would be attending. You never assume anything where Lwaxana Troi is concerned. Betazoid women are full of surprises. Strange... I'm not really very hungry tonight. I wonder what's made me lose my appetite. Any ideas? Of course. You're giving thanks for your food. I'd forgotten that. I wonder how many other cultures have similar customs. I don't know. Well, let's find out. Cmdr Data? Yes, Captain? Mrs Troi and I are having a very interesting discussion about various societies' ways of giving thanks. The Betazoid use of the chime, for instance. The use of the chime is quite unique, but not dissimilar to the Ooolans of Marejaretus VI, who use two stones, continuously struck together during a meal. They eat until the stones are broken. Or the oligarchy on Atifs IV, which requires... Data, this is fascinating. Don't you agree, Mrs Troi? Commander, if your duties permit, why not join us for dessert? I'm sure Mrs Troi would much appreciate your company. What? Indeed, sir? I'm on my way. Data out. How could you think I'd want to share our time together with that... robot of yours? Because of Data's wonderful after-dinner conversation. His anecdotes are the stuff of legend aboard this ship. So, using the square root of pi and multiplying by nine to the third power, I was able to accurately calculate the distance to the Crab Nebula. Fascinating, Data. Absolutely fascinating. I'm sure Mrs Troi would love to hear the one about the... ..anomalous chemical composition of... brown dwarf stars. Not really. Yes, Captain. A particularly spellbinding subject. In most stars, the rare Earth element, europium, is enriched relative to samarium and gadolinium. Is that so? It is. However... Your mother seems an interesting woman, Deanna. Perhaps I should tell you about my mother's condition. Condition? It occurs to Betazed females as they enter mid-life. We call it the phase. Mid-life? As in human menopause? Similar. It's only at mid-life that a Betazoid female becomes, well, fully sexual, if you know what I mean. Yes, I think I do. I also think that I saw the Captain on his way to her quarters. I wonder if I shouldn't warn him. No. As ship's Doctor, I consider it an excellent exercise for his reflexes and agility. Doctor! Staying ahead of your mother. Yes. An animal is always at its best when hunted. Or when hunting. At this point, the second co-orbital satellite avoids a collision... Deanna. Thank the Four Deities you're here. Am I interrupting? No, I must, as a matter of fact, be getting back to the bridge. Captain. Perhaps I should remain and further entertain our guest? No. I mean, I'm sure you're needed on the bridge, as well. Well, ... thank you for... a delicious meal. We must do this again sometime. I know we will. Well, little one, the Captain is every bit as charming as your father was. Data, you will never know how much I owe you for that. Indeed, Captain? I know many more anecdotes. For example... Data. Sir? Later. Yes, sir. Why come aboard at a time like this? I had no choice. I was going to Pacifica, so were you. Don't be absurd. You knew what would happen. What stage is it in? I have it under control. What stage is it in? Far enough along for me to enjoy it, little one. Now I know why you wore that dress. Don't be ridiculous. This simple dress? Nothing provocative. What are we going to do? I'll do the only honourable thing. Your Captain has the inside track. Mother, don't even think it. Why not? He was, all through dinner. I was what? I tell you, Deanna, for a telepath, your mother's accuracy leaves much to be desired. Actually, her telepathic prowess is quite advanced. Except for now. Except for now? Don't misunderstand me, Counsellor. Your mother is a beautiful person. My mother is beginning a physiological phase. One that all Betazoid women must deal with in mid-life. Yes, Troi warned me about it when we started seeing each other. A Betazoid woman, going through this phase, quadruples her sex drive. Or more. More? You never told me that. I didn't want to frighten you. She has opted for the only dignified option open to her. Isolation? She has decided to focus all her sexual energy on one male, who will eventually become her husband. It seems, Captain, that... you are the early favourite. Congratulations, sir. I'm not amused, Number One. There must be some way to convince her that it's... quite impossible, without offending her. You can't apply human logic to this. A Betazoid woman in the phase would be shocked and deeply resentful should you spurn such advances. She would take it personally. Well, under the circumstances, I think it would be... prudent if I were to make myself... ..less available for the duration of the journey. Agreed. Setting, San Francisco, California, United States of America. The year, 1941 AD. The office of Dixon Hill, Private Investigator. Program complete. You may enter when ready. Hi, Dix. Madeline. Good to see you again. You're too much. You make it sound like you ain't seen me in a year. You got two calls. They're on your desk. New cases? Are you kiddin'? Last time we had a case, Hitler and Stalin were buddies. The landlord wants the geetas or he wants you out. The geetas? The moolah, Dix. The rent. And it's been a month since I seen anything. I know it's been tough, with you in hospital, but I got responsibilities. Then... I suppose I had better get a case. It wouldn't hurt. Unavailable? Ship's business? You mean ship's business takes precedence over me? I'm afraid so, Mother. He was too old for me, anyway. Homn. Let us consider my alternate plan. Alternate plan? You worry too much, little one. I have the situation well in hand. There's a gentleman here to see you, Mr Hill. And he doesn't look like a client. Hill, the name is Slade Bender. Excuse me. What can I do for you, Mr Bender? It's about Alva. You'll... have to be a little more precise. OK, you wanna play stupid? That's jake with me. A week ago a man came in, wanted you to find his girlfriend. Alva. Did I find her? You're getting on my nerves. You found her. Face down in the river. I'm sorry to hear that. We're all broken up about it. Especially the boyfriend. He was indicted for murder. And... what are you here to do? Ask for a refund? Nah. I'm here to kill ya. Computer, freeze program. Computer, this isn't what I wanted at all. It's much too violent. I'm here to relax, not dodge bullets. Reconfigure. Please define. More... ambience. Less... substance. Do you wish to leave the holodeck and re-enter, or continue from this point? I will continue. Program complete. You may continue. There's a gentleman here to see you, Mr Hill. Thank you, Madeline. You a private dick? That's what it says on my door. Is that supposed to be funny? Cos if it is, ... ..you gotta know that... ..I ain't in the mood for funny. Now, I came here on serious business. There's a job I want you to do for me. Computer, freeze program. Clear. Computer, this still isn't right. One kind of violence is being substituted for another. Reconfigure. You may continue. Thank you. You're through duckin' me, Hill. Freeze program! Variations on a theme. Computer, perhaps I am not clearly defining my intent. The flexibility of the program is limited to the parameters of the Dix on Hill novels. Yes... Of course. Even in this state, they possess a certain dignity. A graceful countenance. If you say so, Lieutenant. I see. Is this how you felt when you first saw me? Well... Maybe at first, a little. But now I've seen more Klingons, I find you... handsome for a Klingon. That didn't quite come out the way I meant, sir. I still say they look better in sauce. When will the Captain revive them? Not until we reach Pacifica, ma'am. You seem a fine boy. One day, you'll grow up to be a big, strong man. But I cannot afford to wait for you to mature. Now that's more like it. Your thoughts, they're primal, savage. I like that in a man. I am not a man. Which is in your favour. Men being irrational and egotistical. Unfortunately, I've grown accustomed to human companionship. Pity. You'd have made a fine choice. Well, ... who's next, Mr Homn? Yes. Let's do it. I'm not getting any younger. What was that all about? So, Madeline, I'll see you later. Activate program. Leaving, Dix? Not going to Rex's Bar, are you? Rex's Bar? Why do you ask? It's one of the messages I left on your desk. That sounds like an excellent idea. Would you care to join me? Me? Have a drink with you? Why not? There ain't no ""why not"". It's just the first time you asked. Is that a problem? Not for me. But you'd better take this. Why? Because if we're going to Rex's Bar, you're gonna need it. Hey, Dix. What do you know and what do you say? See this? Germany's getting ready to invade England. Who'll stop them? Somebody had better. Just as long as it isn't us. The last thing America needs is to fight another world war. Actually, the Second World War, although disastrous, did grant the US its place as a dominant power and cultural influence in the second half of the 20th century. Additionally, that war was a catalyst of technological advancement. Developments in rocketry and fission resonate on into the 24th century. I dunno if I should pour you one, Dix. Sounds like you got a snootful. What's this? The usual. Yes. Now, let me see. That would be Scotch, neat. What else? And for the lady...? Rye and ginger. Money. I keep forgetting to carry money. I must remember not to do that again. Right. I don't mind you being on the cuff, but you're halfway to my collar. Is that why you wanted to see me, about my bar bill? No. It's on account of... Jimmy Cuzzo. Jimmy Cuzzo... I know that name. He's why I gave you the gun. What was the name of that case he was involved in? The Parrot's Claw. Jeez, Dix. Cuzzo's the guy who iced Marty O'Farron. They'd never have nailed him without you. Your testimony got him arraigned. Yeah. Yours and mine. So, you brought me here because you didn't want to face him alone? I don't wanna face him at all. I'm hoping that seeing us together will help him see things straight. And if it doesn't? Then you just have to kill him. Bridge, this is Dr Pulaski. We've just completed the transfer. The Antedeans are now in sickbay. Acknowledged, Doctor. Mother, what are you doing here? You can't stroll on to the bridge whenever you like. I didn't stroll on, dear. I took that turbo-tube or whatever it is. The Captain's not here? He is busy elsewhere, ma'am. Well, I have other interests, as well. You're scheming something, Mother. Don't try to fool me, I can tell. Always so melodramatic, little one. I'm not scheming. I'm deciding. Mother, not him. And why not him? He's adorable. Pulaski to bridge. Riker here. The Antedeans are coming around. They're in the early stages of post-hibernation. How long until they're fully conscious? I'd guess it to be a matter of hours. Very well. I'll inform the Captain. If you'll excuse me. You're going to see the Captain? I thought he was tied up. Yes, I won't be disturbing him. I'll just give him the message. Excellent timing. Then you may also inform him about us. You don't mind if I let the crew know first, do you, William? Friends! Dear friends. You are all invited to a prestigious occasion on the planet Pacifica. No. There, on the shores of the Western Sea, in a traditional Betazoid ceremony, your Cmdr Riker and I will be joined in the union of matrimony. Married? Until death us do part. Mrs Troi, how can I tell you this...? I know how you feel. You're overwhelmed with excitement. Believe me, I understand. We'll talk about the details later. Right now, there are preparations to be made. Why stop me? Somebody must set her straight. I'll leave that to the Captain. Coward. Commander. Are you planning on going into the holodeck? I thought I might. Care to join me? Could you postpone our departure for just five minutes, sir? No problem. You said you had responsibilities. What did you mean? You know about my mother's cousin, the girl from San Antonio... Jimmy. I'm as jumpy as Haircut Lapinski landing on a fraction. Sorry to bother you, Captain. Captain? Call me Dix. Sorry to bother you, Dix. Our passengers have awakened. Then it's time for me to go. What about Jimmy Cuzzo? You can't leave Rex to face him alone. I'll be back before he arrives. I guarantee, it will be dealt with. Your friends have time for one drink, haven't they? Yes, of course. One more round. These are my associates. This is... Nails from Chicago. And this is... Carlos. From South America. This is Madeline, my secretary. And Rex. You know, I don't think I know your last name. Don't think I have one. Just Rex, that's all. So, fellas, tell me your troubles. Troubles? We have some. A certain woman, wealthy and beautiful, now wants to marry me. She's got looks and bucks? Sounds like you've got yourself one heck of a deal. My fiancé just has to see how I look in this. Come along, Homn. Hello, computer? Is Cmdr Riker still on the bridge? Negative. Riker is currently in holodeck three. Holodeck? Where is that? The comm panel lights will lead you there. Comm...? Good God, what's that? I bet that's the broad with the big bucks. C'mon over here, darling. I've got the best stool in the house saved for you. So this is where you've been hiding, Jean-Luc. I'm surprised you let the ship get so dirty. Relax, Commander. You've made your true feelings quite clear. Obviously, you feel unable to handle me. Why would a beautiful, high-class lady like yourself want to hook up with a mug like that? You're too good for him, if you ask me. You are a very interesting person. You're not bad yourself. In fact, you're as much class as this joint's ever seen. Here... On the house. It's French. Almost. This is the most remarkable man. I've never met anyone like him. I don't suppose you have. He's strong. I get no thoughts from him at all. Nothing. I've never known a man so able to keep his true feelings hidden. That's because... No man has ever... ..been such a mystery. I usually know their thoughts before they do. But not with me? No. And I never realised how erotic that could be. Carry my beverage to that table. We have some things to discuss. Should we tell her? I think it would be only fair. But let's allow her the moment. Food! Worf, the vermicula. Pulaski to Capt Picard. Go ahead, Doctor. Our passengers are on their... feet. Understood. I'd better get to the bridge. What's their condition? Hungry. Would you like to be shown to your rooms? Are you coming, Mrs Troi? Not just yet. Tell William that... I'm sorry. But Rex and I are getting married. Mrs Troi, your government expects me to deliver you to the conference, and that's what I intend to do. Pity. Duty calls, darling. But I'll be back for you later. Mrs Troi, there is something you ought to know about Rex. Imagine. Allowing me to go on like that with that man who doesn't even exist. But you say you like surprises, Mother. Why are they still here? We thought you could beam down with these other delegates. Delegates? Those two are assassins. That is an outrage! Lies. We demand you transport us at once. Don't deny it. I could read such unsophisticated minds in my sleep. Their robes contain ultritium, highly explosive, virtually undetectable by your transporter. She's correct, sir. I am detecting large amounts of ultritium. Of course. They planned to blow up the conference. Mr Worf, disarm them. Hold them for questioning. Aye, sir. Well, I didn't find a mate, but I did save the conference, as well as your reputations. All in a day's work, I suppose. Goodbye, Mrs Troi. And... thank you. Energize, Chief O'Brien. Jean-Luc! Shame on you for thinking such a thing. "
S2E20,"Looking good. I'll go five. Five... here. And five more. I believe the wiser course of action here is to bend. You mean fold, Data. That is correct. Fold. To bend. To make compact or to capitulate. I raise 50. I do not believe Lt Worf understands all the nuances of betting. I wouldn't judge. His pile's a lot bigger than yours. Than any of ours. The cards have favoured Lt Worf, but that is the result of chance, thus, a temporary situation. You hope. Talk or play. Not both. 50, right? 50 is the bet. What's the matter? Your feet getting cold? My cards are getting cold. Here you go. I'm glad you stayed in. I need the chips. Talk, talk, talk. OK, here's the action. 50, ... and another 50. Fold, fold, fold. Your 50, and 50 more. I'd love to play, but not with these cards. Looks like it's just us, handsome. I'll see you. Beats my straight. The Iceman wins again. You took my last chip. At least smile, Worf. That would break his concentration. Your deal. The game is seven-card stud. After the queen, one-eyed jacks and low card in the hole are wild. Wait, let me write this down. I open with 50. Bridge to Cmdr Riker. Receiving a class-11 emergency signal from Starfleet Command. On my way. 50? You were bluffing. Klingons never bluff. Yeah, right. Mr Data? Emergency signal reads as follows. ""Enterprise to divert to coordinates 423 by 112 by 51 immediately."" ""Further orders to follow."" That's it? What's the emergency? The message did not elaborate, sir. Not even a hint. Course laid in. Warp eight. When Starfleet gets enigmatic, I know we're facing a challenge. Engage. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Our destination is a point near the Boradis system. That area was colonized recently as I recall. The first Federation outpost was founded 34 years ago on Boradis III. The Federation has since colonized several planets nearby. Yet we are not headed for a colony. The coordinates are outside the system. Any problems reported in that area? None, sir. What the devil is going on? Captain, Starfleet Command is hailing us. About time. On screen. Greetings, Capt Picard. My compliments, Admiral Gromek. You will soon be joined by a special emissary from Starbase 153. We are now transmitting the specifics. We are receiving, sir. The rendezvous will be tricky, so you must reach the intercept point on schedule. Understood. And the mission? The envoy will fill you in. You are to cooperate fully. Can you give me any details? Negative. It's rather difficult to prepare for a mission I know nothing about. I sympathize, but Starfleet Command considers this a top-security matter. Once the envoy has briefed you, you should understand our caution. Gromek out. Data, what ship is transporting the envoy? Apparently, there were no starships available on Starbase 153. The envoy is aboard a class-8 probe. A class-8 probe is just over two meters long. Yes, that's true, Number One. With transmitters and sensors removed and a life-support system installed, there would be room for one person. And it can travel at warp nine. By sending the probe to us, rather than diverting us, they are saving us 6.1 hours. Starfleet must feel time is of the essence. But to seal someone inside a class-8 probe and launch it... What a way to transport a Federation dignitary. Coming to 31, mark 113. Our course is now parallel to the probe, sir. Increase speed to warp 8.9. 8.9, aye. Full sensors aft. Scanning. Data, project our course beyond the rendezvous. What lies ahead? From what I can tell, very little. There are four colonies, and nine outposts throughout the sector. I have it. Bearing 05, mark 231. Velocity, warp nine. I see it. Adjust speed to intercept. Probe is coming up to starboard. Range, 8200. Tractor beam ready. Mr La Forge? Transporter ready, Captain. Range now... 7500. Steady as she goes. Probe is standing abeam. Engage tractor beam. Transporter beam locked, Captain. Energize. Probe aboard, Captain. Acknowledged. Number One? I'll welcome our visitor. Resume original course and speed. Aye, sir. All yours, Commander. Something wrong, Doctor? I'm not sure. The readings are quite interesting. I greet you. I am K'Ehleyr. You speak Klingon. A little. I'm Cmdr Riker. This is Chief Medical Officer Pulaski. I hope your trip wasn't too unpleasant. Klingons do not mind hardship, but I am delighted I'm out of that coffin. I don't blame you. It's not the most luxurious accommodation. Whoever said ""Getting there is half the fun"" never rode in a probe. How are you feeling? Your vital signs are atypical for a Klingon. Because I am only half Klingon. Yes. My father was Klingon. My mother was human. Captain, allow me to present Special Federation Emissary K'Ehleyr. Welcome aboard. I'm Jean-Luc Picard. This is Counsellor Troi. Lt Cmdr Data. And this is Lt... Worf. So this is where you've been hiding. I told you we'd meet again. Aren't you going to greet me? I have nothing to say to you. Haven't changed a bit. Well, I missed you, too. Two days ago, Starbase 336 received an automated transmission from a Klingon ship, the T'Ong. That ship was sent out over 75 years ago. When the Federation and the Klingons were at war. The message was to Klingon High Command. It said that the ship was going home and was nearing its awakening point. Suggesting that the crew were in cryogenic sleep for the journey. Exactly. And when they're revived? We'll have a ship full of Klingons who think the war's still going on. So our task is to find the ship and tell them they're not at war? Why us? Wouldn't a Klingon ship be better? A Klingon ship, the P'Rang, is two days behind us. It may be too late. Why too late? The T'Ong crew will awaken near several Federation outposts. There are 13 colonies in that sector. Nice, ripe targets for a Klingon warship. And you think you can convince them that humans are now their allies? No, not a chance. I think talking will be a waste of time. Klingons of that era were raised to despise humans. We'll try diplomacy, but I promise you it won't work. Then you'll have to destroy them. No. No? Captain, these Klingons are killers. You'll have no choice. We shall find another choice. I want options before we encounter the Klingon ship. Lieutenant, ... I'm assigning you to help the Emissary. Dismissed. I will escort you to the guest quarters. Captain. Lieutenant? Sir, I suggest Cmdr Riker or Data can better serve the Special Emissary. Any personal reasons you don't want the assignment? Yes. Any professional reasons? No. I withdraw my request, Captain. Good. I didn't know humans and Klingons could produce children. Actually, the DNA is compatible, with a fair amount of help. Rather like my parents. I know what you mean. My father was human and my mother is Betazoid. Really? It was the other way round for me. My mother was human. You must have grown up like me, trapped between cultures. I never felt trapped. I tried to experience the richness and diversity of the two worlds. Perhaps you got the best of each. Myself, I think I got the worst of each. I doubt that. Yes. Having my mother's sense of humour is bad enough. It's gotten me into plenty of trouble. And your Klingon side? That I keep under tight control. It's like a terrible temper, not something I want people to see. Everyone has tempers. Not like mine. Sometimes I feel there's a monster inside of me, fighting to get out. And it frightens you? Of course it does. My Klingon side can be... terrifying. Even to me. It gives you strength. It's a part of you. That doesn't mean I have to like it. You are late. Sorry. Had to make myself beautiful. I fail to understand why. Worf, we're alone now. You don't have to act like a Klingon glacier. I don't bite. Well, that's wrong. I do bite. Shall we proceed with our duties? You weren't this aloof six years ago. Or don't you remember? Nothing is wrong with my memory. Something is wrong with you. You're not even looking at me. I am familiar with your appearance. And it gives you no pleasure to see me again. It isn't as if we tried it and it didn't work, you know. You never gave it a chance. I never? I mean, as I see it, we have some... ..unfinished business, you and I. Not as far as I'm concerned. According to the library computer, the Captain of the T'Ong is K'Temoc. There is nothing on the ship's mission. Probably some secret military objective. Perhaps. But we have no evidence of that. Why else would there be no record of the mission? The records may simply have been lost. What does it matter? Our concern is the present, the possible threat. To contend with that threat, we need information. We have all the information we need. That is foolish. Knowing their mission may help us understand them. There is nothing to understand. These are Klingons. They'll attack. In their minds, we're the enemy, and we can't talk them out of that. And I do not appreciate being interrupted. And I do not appreciate wasting my time! We were instructed to find options. There aren't any. The assignment's hopeless. There are always options. Are there? Tell me, whatever happened to that wonderful Klingon fatalism of yours? My experiences aboard this ship have taught me most problems have more than one solution. Starfleet hasn't improved you one bit. You're as stubborn as ever. Are you going to carry out your duties, or aren't you? Alright. I will. Upon due consideration of the problem and careful examination of all possible options, my original recommendation stands. Meeting adjourned! Come. You're upset. Your finely honed Betazoid sense tell you that? Well, that and the table. I warned you about my Klingon half. May I make a suggestion? I thank you, Counsellor, but I don't want any counselling. I was going to suggest something else. I find the exercise programs on the holodeck rigorous enough to take my mind off most frustrations. And it'll keep me from wrecking the ship. That, too. Enter program. Show me the exercise menu. Hold. Callisthenics program of Lt Worf. Program complete. You may enter when ready. Status, Mr Data? Based on the last position of the Klingon ship, its trajectory and estimates of its speed, we should be within scanner range in 15 hours, eight minutes. Lieutenant? Special Emissary K'Ehleyr has... declared a short recess, sir. I wish to run a test on tactical backup equipment. We just tested all those systems. I wish to check them again. Lieutenant. I commend your diligence. However, I'm concerned that you're working yourself too hard. Sir, given the unknowns we will face... Lieutenant, I order you to relax. I am relaxed. Yes, sir. I've never before seen the Lieutenant so... unsettled. The Iceman's finally melting. Not much of a program. Computer, ... ..level two. Some callisthenics programs are better than others. You still can make jokes. You don't like a sense of humour? I did not say that. Worf, you're the perfect Klingon. The ultimate minimalist. Talk to me. I've noted that some people use humour as a shield. They talk much, yet say little. Whereas others take a simpler approach. Say nothing. When one does not have the words. Or is loath to speak them. Why didn't we do this six years ago? We were not ready. I was. No. We were both too young, too... unaware. We lacked commitment. Perhaps we lacked courage as well. No longer. Wait. You can't mean... We are mated. Yes, I know. I was there. But... Now we must solemnize our union with the oath. I am not going to become your wife. You already are. Don't give me that Klingon nonsense. You would dishonour our sacred traditions? They're not sacred. They're absurd. Marrying you is out of the question for a million reasons. They didn't stop you earlier. Worf, it was what it was, glorious and wonderful, and all that. But it doesn't mean anything. That is a human attitude. I am human! You are also Klingon. So that means we should bond for life? It is our way. Yours. Not mine. I will not take the oath. Then this night had no meaning. And that... I will not believe. Believe what you will. Approaching the coordinates. Slow to impulse. Short- and long-range sensor scans negative. Lay in a standard search pattern. Search pattern laid in. Full impulse. Engage. I hope we find them before they end their nap. Agreed. No outpost in this area could defend itself from a Klingon warship. I'm working on our assignment, trying a few computer simulations. Your devotion to duty is commendable... if belated. Unwilling to be alone with me? I asked Cmdr Data to help us analyze the alternatives. An android chaperon. Android, of course, is correct. But... ..I fail to see how chaperon is applicable here. Never mind. I guess I can't blame you. Tell me one thing. You'd have gone through with the oath, wouldn't you? Regardless of the consequences to our careers, to our lives. Honour demanded no less. What do you want? Is honour all you care about? Don't you feel anything else? No comment? Poor android. Whose behaviour do you find more perplexing? Human... or Klingon? At the moment, I would find it difficult to choose. So would I. OK, when we locate the T'Ong, there are two possibilities. First... We find the ship before it reaches the awakening point and simply keep them asleep. Is that feasible? We can override their controls. That way we await the arrival of the Klingon ship P'Rang. So when the T'Ong's crew awakens, they are surrounded by Klingons. That would be ideal. But there's the second possibility. That the crew of the T'Ong has already revived. They see this is Federation territory and attack an outpost. Theirs could be a scientific voyage. Klingons of that era doing research for its own sake? But they may be reasonable. That point is beside the point. These are Klingons, at war with us. Whatever their mission, once they see a Federation target, they'll attack. Can they be disabled rather than destroyed? We could knock out their engines without damaging the ship. No use. Disable the ship and K'Temoc will destroy it himself. Klingons do not surrender. If we don't reach it before they wake up, you have no alternatives. I can't accept that. There must be some way to make the Klingons listen. If we convince them... Captain, we've detected a ship. Bearing 316, mark 42. Extreme sensor range. Lay in intercept course. Go to yellow alert. Shields are up. Better lock in phasers. It may be your only chance. Intercept course laid in. Hold position. Let's see if they've spotted us. Magnification, 100. Mr Data? Life forms are aboard. Unable to ascertain whether they are awake. Their propulsion is inactive, so I hypothesize that they are asleep. However, I could be in error. Shields holding. They've cloaked themselves. Well, Captain, you've had your chance. Transferring Engineering to the bridge. Can you find them? I think so. Those old shields weren't too efficient at blocking gamma-ray output. If I can tune the sensors to a particular band... There, got 'em. Transferring coordinates to helm. Intercept. Warp two. Warp two, sir. Let them die like Klingons, in battle. They deserve that much. Captain. I have another option. Captain's log, stardate 42901.3. Despite their cloaking shields, we have located the Klingon vessel. In an effort to avoid confrontation, we plan to implement the option presented by Lt Worf. The T'Ong has changed course to 32, mark 81 . Increasing to warp three. Standard evasive manoeuvre. Stay with them. Yes, sir. The T'Ong is now on a heading of 42, mark 113, accelerating to warp five. They're making a break for it. Overtake, warp eight. Aye. Put us right in their path. Come to a full stop. Full power to shields. We've thrown down the gauntlet. Let's see if they pick it up. Slowing to impulse, sir. Phaser hit on forward shields. Brimming up now. No damage. I guess we've piqued their interest now. Agreed. Give them a chance to look their enemy in the face. Ready, Lieutenant. Open hailing frequencies. Open, sir. What... ? What is this? Captain K'Temoc, have you lost your mind? Halt your vessel and drop your shields! What treachery is this? By whose authority? I am Worf, commanding the Enterprise. And it is you who have committed treason by firing on this vessel. I have standing orders to fire on all Federation ships. You fool! Did it not occur to you that the war would be over by now? I have no proof of that. Trust your eyes. Or is your brain still stuck in its long slumber? How do I know this is no Federation trick? How can I be sure? Captain, as you are new to this century, I have tried to be patient. But I will tolerate no further insubordination. Drop your shields immediately. And if I refuse? Then die in ignorance. I can waste no more time on you. Phasers to full power. Aye, sir. Phasers ready. Target locked. You dare not destroy us. We are on a crucial mission for Klingon High Command. Has the T'Ong dropped its shields? No, sir. Very well. Fire all phasers. Wait! Lower the shields. I yield command of the T'Ong to you, Capt Worf. Long live the Klingon Empire. A wise decision, Captain. Cmdr K'Ehleyr will board and take command. The Klingon cruiser P'Rang will soon arrive and escort you home. And Captain... Yes? Welcome to the 24th century. I return command to you, Captain. Thank you, Lieutenant. Congratulations. A very fine first command. Well done. How did you like command? Comfortable chair. And you wore it well. One to beam aboard the T'Ong. All set. I relieve you. Yes, Lieutenant. The Klingon P'Rang will rendezvous with you in three days. And I'll begin the assimilation of these Klingons to our era. Is there anything else you require? No. Nothing else. Damn you, Worf. You'd let me go without saying another word, wouldn't you? What needs to be said? Nothing. Everything. We're about to go our separate ways again. And that disturbs you? I hid the truth from you. Last night did have meaning. I was tempted to take the oath with you. But it scared me. I've never had such strong feelings toward anyone. Nor have I. Then it was more than just a point of honour. Maybe someday, when our paths cross again, ... ..I won't be so easy to get rid of. I will not be complete... without you. "
S2E21,"Captain's log, stardate 42923.4. Despite misgivings, I have agreed to Starfleet's request to divert to the Braslota system to take part in a war-game exercise. Joining us as observer and mediator is the Zakdorn master strategist, Sirna Kolrami. Mr Kolrami, Capt Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome aboard. Captain, I bring you greetings from those at Starfleet Command. Would you care to see your quarters? I require little rest. I prefer that we commence with our mission. Despite their reputations, this Zakdorn does not appear to be a very formidable warrior. In military brinksmanship, individual physical prowess is less important than the perception of the whole species. For over nine millennia, foes have regarded the Zakdorns as having the greatest strategic minds in the galaxy. So no one is willing to test that perception in combat. Exactly. Then the reputation means nothing. The Braslota system. In orbit around the second planet is the 80-year-old starcruiser Hathaway. He is still your first choice? Cmdr Riker will captain the Hathaway. You have 48 hours to prepare before the Enterprise attacks. We'll experience battle conditions? Correct. Engineering will disconnect the Enterprise's weapons and link the system with a modified pulse beam. Hits are recorded electronically. If the computer registers damage, it will act accordingly, shutting down the affected areas for the appropriate repair time. Additional questions? Capt Picard, it is my understanding that you initially resisted the request for this simulation. Yes. May I know why? Starfleet is not military. Its purpose is exploration. Then why am I here? With the Borg threat, I decided that my officers and I needed to hone our tactical skills. In a crisis situation, it is prudent to have several options. I prefer brains over brawn, too. It's a waste of effort testing combat skills. It's a small part in the make-up of a captain. Your objection is noted. Let us hope that your distaste for the exercise will not affect your strategic abilities. Mr Kolrami, when I agree to do something, I do it. Do you care to surrender now? Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange, new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Your team should number 40, so select whom you will, except Mr Data, who will serve as my First Officer. I had envisaged you defining the crew. Here, the leader of an away team controls the mission. If you want to judge leadership, start at the beginning. Very well, Captain. My, what a charmer. Doctor... Captain, he needs an attitude adjustment. The Zakdornian culture is replete with self-assuredness. Seldom is it undeserved. Kolrami is a third-level grandmaster at the game of strategema. Another millimeter. That's it. A little more. There. That's excellent. Lieutenant? Yes, Commander? You've heard about the simulation? Yes. Good luck. I researched those Avidyne engines. They're archaic. Touchy. Anticipating the worst, can they be overhauled in 48 hours? I've already taken the liberty of putting together a few necessities. Enter! Am I disturbing you? Just finished. What do you think of the simulation? Waste of time. It's just an exercise. Useless. If there is nothing to lose, no sacrifice, then there is nothing to gain. You mean, besides pride. In this case, it doesn't matter. I probably haven't got a chance. There is always a chance. Slim. The Hathaway's most sophisticated weapons, even in a computer mock-up, can't defeat the Enterprise. Well, still... You're out-manned, out-gunned, out-equipped. What's left? Guile. Join me. The honour is to serve. Scan all sectors within three light years of Braslota. How's your crew shaping up? One last request. Anyone in particular? I would like Acting Ensign Crusher on board for educational observation. Thank you, Captain. We'll have some time before reaching Braslota. Would you play me in a game of strategema? Although I'm intrigued by the audacity of your request, I can't fathom why you would wish the encounter. I enjoy a challenge. Very well. An opponent of limited dimensions can often be quite diverting. Thank you. You're gonna beat him? No. Then it's gonna be close? No. But you have a chance? No! Are you going to show up? Sure. Kolrami's the best. Just to play him is a privilege. Aside from that, is there anything to look forward to? No. This is gonna be exciting. Against an opponent of approximate skill, strategema can last over 1,000 moves. I wouldn't bet on being here that long. I have wagered heavily in the ship's pool that you will take him past the sixth plateau. And if I don't? I will be irritated. Forever curious, this urge to compete. It's a human response. That inborn craving to gauge your capabilities through conflict. There are other ways to challenge oneself. Perhaps, but they all lack a certain thrill. Humans can find it helpful to have an outsider set the standard by which they're judged. To avoid deceiving oneself. Maybe you should challenge Kolrami to strategema. Why, Doctor? When someone is that smug, you occasionally have to deflate them a little. Yeah, I'd like to see your neural flex tear him down a peg. To what end? Computer, actuation positions for strategema. Ready? Begin. Come on, Commander. Will. You can get him. Come on. Come on, you got him. Here you go. That's it? I'm afraid so. But you only made 23 moves. Yes. Congratulations. Cmdr Riker, there's your next challenge. Away team assembled and ready to transport. I may get there and want to come right home. Good luck, Number One. Captain. The simulation will commence in 48 hours. There should be some emergency bridge lighting here. Not good. You're wrong, Mr Worf, it's fantastic. And it's ours. Mr Worf? Sir, Lt La Forge is a superior officer. The honour should be his. This is a battle simulation. You're my Tactical Officer. I've discussed this with Geordi and we agreed. Besides, if Engineering's anything like the bridge, I'll be busy. Attention, crew of the USS Hathaway. This is your Captain. Over the next two days you might lose a lot of sleep, but with your skill and stamina we'll have this lady ready to fly. I want hourly progress reports from all stations. Riker out. Nice job, Geordi. Now what are the possibilities of warp drive? Not good. There are only a few dilithium fragments left in the holding clamps. Also, there's no antimatter to fuel the drive. Any recommendations? No, sir. We haven't got a prayer. Would you like to transfer back to the Enterprise, Mr Crusher? No, sir. Wes, remember our purpose is to improvise. It's the effort that counts. Open. I believe the rules are understood by all. Weapons conversion, Lt Burke? Complete, Captain. Signal received. Locked on. She's been stripped down. The only offensive systems you need will be simulated. What's the Zakdornian word for mismatch? ""Challenge."" We do not whine about the inequities of life. How you perform in a mismatch is what is of interest to Starfleet. After all, when one is in the superior position, one is expected to win. Screen off. You have the bridge, Mr Data. Aye, sir. Lt Cmdr Data, I'm intrigued by your challenge. Dr Pulaski informed me of your desire to play a game of strategema. But I expressed no such interest. Data means he would never have asked you himself, but he wants to pit his skill against yours. Play against a machine. Why should I wish to? I don't blame you. It's no fun when you know you're going to lose. But I wouldn't lose. Now you'll no doubt tell me to prove it. Data, you can't let that pass. Indeed, I... Cannot. Then you will play for the honour of your ship. The honour of the ship? It's your reputation that's on the line. With my knowledge of the Enterprise's Security override, we may be able to convince the sensors that an enemy ship is approaching. Their instruments would lie to them. That might give us the edge we're looking for. But what about the viewscreen? If I am successful, the computer will project a false image of the enemy ship. So unless someone runs to a window and looks out... They're going to fall for it! The lining's still smooth. We should be able to do something with the dilithium we scavenged. I'm sure the system's functional. But without antimatter, what difference does it make? I have to return to the Enterprise. We've only got 32 hours! This is important. And this isn't? Attempt the routeing bypass here. If it works, they will be surprised. Where am I going to get the opti-cable? Anywhere. Captain? I left an experiment running on the Enterprise. May I go back and shut it down? It's that important? It has to be monitored. It is my final grade in plasma physics. Message from the Hathaway, sir. On screen. Request permission for Ensign Crusher to reboard. Why? Apparently, he left a very critical experiment unattended. Any objection? He should be escorted, and have no contact with anything save his research. Permission granted. Mr Burke, will you handle that? Aye, sir. I don't know why Riker chose him. Just a noncommissioned child. I can't believe I forgot about this. I let excitement cloud my judgement. It's very dull. I spent six weeks setting this up. That's a lot of work. Oh, no! This is ruined. Too bad. Look, is this going to take much longer? I'll have to dispose of this safely. It's very volatile. I'll beam it off the Enterprise. Fine. Just do it. I'll transfer it to the transporter room. In the present context, what did she mean by, ""Bust him up""? In her own way, Dr Pulaski was instructing you to take the shortest route to victory. As opposed to what? Ready? Begin. I can't believe it. A computer beaten by flesh and blood? You advanced quite far against a worthy opponent. Thoroughly enjoyable, Mr Data. I'm at your disposal for a rematch. Thank you. But what would be the point? How can you lose? You're supposed to be infallible. Obviously, I am not. Ensign, where is Cmdr Data? He has temporarily removed himself from bridge duty, sir. Your crew is excellently trained. A tribute to your leadership. Although I doubt their extensive preparation will be needed. Why is that? I do not expect Capt Riker will present much of a challenge. Mr Kolrami, may I speak with you in private? I want to know the root of your prejudice for my First Officer. Captain. Mr Kolrami, you have denigrated and abused Cmdr Riker since coming aboard this ship. I would like some explanation. Having studied William Riker's file prior to this assignment, I have found him wanting. In what regard? His work record is exemplary, but, as you know, a starship captain is not manufactured. He, or she, is born from inside. From the character of the individual. My interviews have revealed a man who displays circumstantially inappropriate joviality, belying the seriousness of his station. Don't confuse style with intent. Only a fool would question Riker's dedication to Starfleet and the people under his command. He is the finest officer with whom I have ever served. We shall see if your faith is well founded. The test is whether the crew will follow where he leads. His... His joviality is the means by which he creates that loyalty. And I will match his command style with your statistics any time. Come in, please. Data. Counsellor. Is something the matter? That was going to be my question. With my repository of knowledge, I expected to perform better against a humanoid life form. Some of our greatest advances have come from analyzing failure. While it can be ego-bruising... I do not have an ego. Yes. Well, a loss can be disheartening. But I do not have a... Data! You can handle defeat in two ways. You can lose confidence, or you can learn from your mistakes. That is what troubles me. I made no mistakes. I have conducted a diagnostic check of all my programs. I am checking the ship's computer. Is that all necessary? I believe so. I have proven to be vulnerable. At present, my deductions should be treated with scepticism. That's why you haven't been on the bridge? Yes. The Captain would be ill-advised to rely upon my judgement. I think you're overreacting. I'm sure you're alright. l, however, am not sure. Easy now. Is that it? Yeah. Good. Good work. Alright. Hand me that connector on the kit. What is that? My experiment from the Enterprise. Wes? It deals with high-energy plasma reactions with antimatter. You went back to the Enterprise for that? You cheated. No, sir. You told me to improvise. We need to calibrate a thermal curve to start a controlled reaction. Assuming you can, can you regulate the reaction? There's just enough crystal left to do it. We'll channel the reaction through the chips. Are we good? Better than good. Great. Brilliant. It's gonna be fun. Carry on. Come in, please. Alright, Data, enough of this. Doctor? How long are you going to sulk like Achilles in his tent? I'm conducting diagnostic... You can sell Troi that story, but not me. You're smarting because you were beaten. Well, it happens. No, Doctor, I'm concerned about giving the Captain unsound advice. I wish I had never manoeuvred you into playing that game! I'm sorry. Why, Doctor? It is done, and perhaps just as well. This has indicated that I am damaged in some fashion. I must find the malfunction. The simulation begins in one hour. You'll have warp drive, but maybe not what you expect. That deserves an explanation. We'll have warp one for... Just under two seconds. Not enough for an escape. It may give us strategic advantage. All of this is theoretical. And if it fails to pay off? Have you ever driven a Grenthemen water hopper? Ever popped the clutch? We could stall the Hathaway? And the Enterprise will pulverise us. Let me try to understand. You are saying that Cmdr Data is suffering from a profound loss of confidence, and that you believe that only I can restore the balance? Yes, sir. Deanna and I have tried, but we're not getting through to him. Don't you think you're overreacting? Data is not capable of the emotions you're assigning him. The effects are the same, whether it's human emotions or android algorithms. Data is not on the bridge and I don't think he will be until we find some way to address his problem. I'm less than one hour away from a battle simulation, and I have to hand-hold an android. The burdens of command. Come in, please. I require your presence on the bridge. Captain, with all due respect, you should choose another First Officer. You are my First Officer. I have not isolated the problem. I might make a mistake. Yes, you might. But that does not alter your duty to me and to this ship. Do you know how to formulate a premise? Yes, sir. Formulate this. How do I deal with Cmdr Riker and the Hathaway? I will await your answer on the bridge. And, Commander, it is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness. That is life. I believe I understand, sir. Will you leave your hesitation and self-doubt here in your quarters? I have several examples of Cmdr Riker's battle technique. At the Academy, he calculated a sensory blind spot on a Tholian vessel and hid within it in a battle simulation. As a lieutenant on the Potemkin, his solution to a crisis was to shut down power and hang over a planet's magnetic pole, confusing his opponent's sensors. From these specifics, what conclusion can you extrapolate? Only 21 percent of the time does he rely on traditional tactics. So, the Captain must be prepared for unusual cunning. Counsellor, Cmdr Riker will assume we have made this analysis. Knowing that we know his methods, he will alter them. But knowing that he knows that we know that he knows, he might return to his usual pattern. Wait! You're overanalyzing, Data. One cannot deny human nature. What kind of a man is Cmdr Riker? A fighter? Yes. The weaker his position, the more aggressive his posture. And he won't give up. Then despite whatever options he is given, he must be... The man that he is. Exactly. Is that a failing in humans? You will have to decide that for yourself. On screen. The hunt begins, Number One. We're ready. Remember, Enterprise, Capt Riker has never lost. Begin now. Screen off. Set course 223, mark 357. Full impulse power. Initiate Kumeh manoeuvre. Kumeh manoeuvre? Why start with such a recognizable ploy? He wants us to reveal our tactics. Mr Worf? Counter with the Talupian manoeuvre. Agreed. Three-quarter impulse, full on my command. Mr Worf, prepare your surprise. Aye, sir. Set course 317, mark 73. Present minimal aspect. Ready warp one. Optimal spread on simulated torpedoes. Romulan warship approaching from astern. What? It came out of nowhere. Bring us about. Maximum shields. Full weapon systems. Open hailing frequency. I can't, sir, there's nothing there. Warp three, evasive. Disengage weapons and shields. Re-engage modified beam. He's quite good. He's the best. Computer reports simulated damage to several aft decks. Repair time, 3.6 days. How did he do that? Mr Worf overrode the sensor codes. Played some holographic games. Mr Data, input a new code. Attack posture, circumvental attitude. Prepare beams for photon mode. Bye-bye, Hathaway. Computers report damage to the Enterprise. They're moving. Why not go after them? They're not through with us. Prepare warp jump. There are no guarantees. There never are. I'm gonna trust your expertise. Stand by for my signal. Ready with photon torpedoes. Captain, sensors picking up a Ferengi warship at warp five. Did you input that new code? Aye, sir. Mr Worf, I didn't give you enough credit. Continue the simulation... Divert all power to shields! Sever modified beams. Engage phasers and target. Fire when ready! That's no ghost attacking. That's real. We must assist, sir. We've no offensive weapons. Where are my weapons? Unavailable, sir. We cannot disengage the modified beams. We must retreat! Unacceptable. The Ferengi have stopped their attack. Transport the away team aboard. Transporter functions gone, sir. Shields reduced. Use this moment to escape. I have 40 crew on the Hathaway. Sacrifice them to save 1,000. Acceptable tactical losses under the circumstances. Not to me! Notify Starfleet. Hail the Ferengi on my word. Formulate alternatives. As the observer, I order you to withdraw! I am the Captain! Your order is nullified. Ferengi on main viewscreen. I am Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship USS Enterprise. Why have you attacked my vessel? Why was your ship combative with another Federation vessel of lesser design? Why do you now protect your former target? What is its value to you? Our probes indicate you were aware of our approach, yet took no action. Your answers will dictate our response. We have refrained from launching a counterattack in the hope of a peaceful resolution. Our probes indicate that you are crippled, and the ship you protect has no weaponry, no light-speed drive, and only a scarce crew. This makes no sense to us. Unless it contains something very valuable. I am Bractor, Leader of the Ferengi attack vessel Kreechta! I will have the secret of the other Federation ship. Surrender it to me, and I will allow your Enterprise to leave unharmed. You have ten of your minutes. Sir, they're massing a surge of power. We're being scanned. They've locked on. Data? Our shields will not withstand another assault. Then there are no options. Retreat or die. Captain's log, supplemental. Due to my miscalculation, the Enterprise has been subjected to a surprise attack by the Ferengi. I have little time to decide the fate of 40 of my crew stranded aboard the derelict Hathaway. I am open to suggestions. Captain, we can launch a limited number of photon torpedoes. I've given you my advice. The Hathaway is expendable. Cmdr Riker is hailing, sir. On screen. Have you been monitoring communications? Yes, sir. Kolrami's right. Save the Enterprise. That would leave you defenceless. When Bractor closes in, we'll hit our warp drive, take our chances. Your what? We have a two-second warp capability. Impossible! That ship was rendered warp inactive. I told you he was the best. I'd like to hear more about this. Later. Right now, I have to work something out with Mr Data. Premise. The Ferengi want the Hathaway, believing it to be of value. We must remove it from their field of interest. They will soon locate it after a two-second warp. There is a way. Number One, can you hear this? Yes, sir. We're all here. Can you pull a rabbit out of your hat? Mr Data? On the Captain's command, we will fire four photon torpedoes at the Hathaway. One millisecond later, the computer will trigger your warp jump. I hate this plan. We're not even sure our warp jump will work. If the warp engines fail to function, the result could be unfortunate. Very unfortunate. We will be dead. Capt Riker, I cannot order you to do this. What the hell? Nobody said life was safe. The advantage is, that it will appear from the Kreechta's perspective as though... As though you were destroyed in the explosion. That will deceive them only for a few minutes. Their sensors will soon locate us. We only need a few minutes. You'll prepare a surprise for them. Then we're agreed. On my mark, four minutes. Remember, if the implementation is off by one millisecond, the Hathaway will not survive. That's the one thing we're all absolutely sure about. Are we ready, Number One? Ready, Captain. Ready, Captain. Good luck to both of you. Bractor. I will wait no longer, Picard. The answer is no. Your actions have been criminal. You will not profit by them. You are a fool! How can you stop us? You believe the Hathaway has value? We deny you your prize. Fire! Destroy your own, rather than suffer the ignominy of defeat? I did not think the Federation had such iron. You had no claim on that vessel. It was ours to destroy. As you are ours to destroy. You can try. Enterprise targeted, Leader! Leader, there is another Federation ship closing. A starship! Maximum shields! We have been outmanoeuvred. Retreat. Our sensors show no Federation starship nearby. Of course not. That was Klingon guile. You made it, Number One. Smooth ride? Well, it certainly was different. We'll lock on and pick you up. With pleasure, Captain. I must admit, your Cmdr Riker acquitted himself quite admirably. And so, Captain, have you. My report to Starfleet will be most favourable. Thank you. Initiate recovery procedures. Continue repairs. Plot a course for the nearest starbase. Captain's log, supplemental. With the transporter repaired and my crew safely aboard, we have officially ended our Starfleet battle simulation. Why have you suspended the game? Because this is not a rematch! You have made a mockery of me. Data, you beat him! No, sir. It is a stalemate. No game has ever gone this high. What did you do? I simply altered my premise. Working under the assumption that Kolrami wanted to win, he expected me to play for the same goal. You didn't. No. I was playing for a standoff. A draw. While Kolrami was dedicated to winning, I passed up obvious avenues of advancement to settle for a balance. Theoretically, I could challenge him indefinitely. Then you have beaten him. It is a matter of perspective. In the strictest sense, I did not win. Data! I busted him up. Yes! "
S2E22,"There you are. What's wrong? Something jabbed me in the calf. O'Brien, Cmdr Riker's injured. Bring him up. Stand by. Geordi... It's just a scratch? Right. Sorry. We're the first team on this planet. We don't know what the risks are. O'Brien, what's the hold-up? The transporter shows unidentified microbes in Cmdr Riker. Can't the biofilter screen 'em out? No. Dr Pulaski has been notified. Acknowledged. I wasn't ready to leave anyway. Here's the biofilter analysis of the microbes. Not much to go on. I can override and beam Cmdr Riker aboard. No. I'd better go down and make an evaluation there. I hope these are the right coordinates. Just kidding. I know you love the transporter. About as much as I love comical transporter chiefs. Ready? Over here, Doctor. Fill me in. I was walking along doing a simple geological sweep. Something stuck me in the leg. Any pain? No. It's just a little numb. Do you know what stuck you? We've looked. No luck. Whatever it is, it left something behind. I'll take you up to sickbay. O'Brien, this is Dr Pulaski. Medical override is authorized. Acknowledged. This is the strangest feeling. My leg just went dead. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 42976.1. During a survey on Surata IV, Cmdr Riker has become infected by an unidentified microbe. Number One. Captain. Put your foot where it didn't belong? The Doctor was bored so I gave her a challenge. That you did. Cmdr Riker's nervous system has been invaded by an unknown microorganism. Not a bacteria, not a virus, but with elements of both. There's the point of entry. The microbes are infecting the great sciatic nerve, and they are multiplying at an incredible rate. There. Can you remove it? Not surgically. The organisms fuse to the nerve, intertwining at the molecular level. That's why the transporter's biofilters couldn't extract it. There's no evidence of nerve damage but the organisms are impeding nervous function. My leg's still asleep. Prognosis? The infection is spreading. It will eventually reach the brain. And if it interfered with neural activity? Cmdr Riker could die. How can I help? I need to know more about its composition. For that you need a sample. Exactly. Cmdr Data, Mr La Forge, prepare to beam down to the planet. Aye, sir. I must reiterate, it would be better if I went alone. Don't like my company? Your company is not at issue. Your vulnerability is. I'll watch my step. Besides, this bug may prefer androids to humans. Possible, but highly unlikely. In any event, why risk both of us? Because I know where he was when it happened. Mr O'Brien, ... energize. He was right over here. I am detecting no animal life forms within 50 kilometers. However, I am reading extensive animal remains, mostly fossilized. A graveyard? I do not know. Look at this. The structure is rhizomatous. Careful. I'm always careful. It appears to be dead. I'm not so sure. I'm seeing thermal variations. Let it go. Let's try something. Maybe it likes humans over androids. If so, you could be placing yourself in danger. I know. I'm counting on those great android... reflexes of yours. That must be what we're looking for. I tend to agree. Stand by, O'Brien. Got it. Energize! Thanks, O'Brien. Another minute and we'd have been fossils, too. Not precisely. True fossilization requires several millennia. Here's your sample. Get it to sickbay right away. Report. Captain, Cmdr Riker's injury was not accidental. Certain vines seek warm-blooded beings and deliberately infect them. To what end? Unknown, sir. There might be a symbiotic relationship involved. Go on. There are many animal remains around, leading me to hypothesize that the vines could be predatory. Vines infect animals in order to kill them? It is possible. For Cmdr Riker's sake, I hope my hypothesis is in error. Unfortunately, Cmdr Data, your hypotheses rarely are. All negative. Is there nothing to cure this infection? This microorganism is very mysterious. I can't even figure out what's keeping it alive. Or how to kill it? I can kill it. But not without destroying the nerves it's inhabiting. I know you're doing your best. My best may not be good enough. Comfortable? Why wouldn't I be? They wait on me hand and foot. I just hope they don't find out that I'm faking it. I wish you were faking it. I've seen the thorn. Yes. So have I. It looks harmless. And deadly. I'm sorry. Well, these things happen. When least expected. I'm surprised they don't happen more often. We are exploring the unknown. And the unknown can be benign... ..or malevolent. One of the things I've learned on these voyages, and from you, is that most life forms act out of an instinct for survival, not malice. It's an important lesson, and I admire your lack of resentment, Number One. If you drop a hammer on your foot, there's no use getting mad at the hammer. Anything? Not yet. What can I do? You can get out of my hair. Aye aye, Doctor. The bug is persistent, I admit. But I'm not worried. We Rikers are ornery too. My great-grandfather once got bit by a rattlesnake. After three days of intense pain, the snake died. You're a very entertaining patient. I try. You're trying hard to be cheerful. You, of all people, should know. You feel what anyone in your position would feel. As the First Officer on this ship, I have to set an example. Even now? Now more than ever. Deanna, facing death is the ultimate test of character. I don't want to die, but if I have to, I hope to do it with some pride. And a lot of impudence. You bet. Dying's bad enough, but to lose my sense of humour? Forget it. Imzadi. I haven't given up yet. It's spread to the spinal column. It's weakening his autonomic nervous system. Judging by its present rate of growth and its infiltration pattern, the infection will spread to the brain within an hour. Medical log, stardate 42976.3. I can't keep the alien infection from spreading to Riker's brain. Once there, it will kill him by dampening neural impulses. I can only keep him alive by forcing the neurons to stay active, by stimulating them directly with electrical impulses. Let's proceed. Good. Stand by with five milligrams of tricordrazine in case of seizure. Here goes. Anybody? We have stimulated random activity but the patterns are erratic. Hang on, Will. Hang on. The wave patterns are still too irregular. Why won't they stabilize? Wait. I've found the right amplitude. There. The patterns are steadier. Is it preventing the infection from taking hold? For now. The vertex waves show a K-complex corresponding to an REM state. He's dreaming. Hello! Marvellous. How easily humans do that. I still need much practice. There are some puzzles down on... ..the planet that the Captain wants answered. He suggests you for my away team. I shall endeavour to function adequately. Yes. When the Captain suggested you, I looked up your record. A wise procedure. Your rank of Lieutenant Commander is honorary? Starfleet class of '78. Honours in probability mechanics and exobiology. But the file says you're a... Machine. Does that trouble you? To be honest, yes. Understood, sir. Prejudice is very human. That troubles me. Do you consider yourself superior? I am superior, in many ways. But I'd gladly give it up to be human. Nice to meet you, ... Pinocchio. A joke. Intriguing. You'll be an interesting companion. What should I say? How do I act? What do I do? Guinan, I need your help. Step over here. Sounds simple enough. Now, first words are important. You may want to start like this. You are the most beautiful woman in the galaxy. But that might not work. Yes. It would. I've so wanted to say that. But you were afraid? Yes. Of me? Of us, what we might become. Commander? That you might think it was a line. Maybe I do think it's a line. You think I'm not sincere? I didn't say that. What's wrong with a line? It's like a knock at the door. You're inviting me in? I'm not sending you away. It's more than I expected. Is it what you hoped? To hope is to recognize the possibility. I had only dreams. Dreams can be dangerous. Not these. I dream of a galaxy where your eyes are the stars and the universe worships the night. Careful. Putting me up so high, you may not be able to reach me. Then I'll learn how to fly. You're the heart in my day and the soul in my night. This isn't my style. Shut up, kid. Tell me more about... my eyes. I couldn't go without saying goodbye. I don't like goodbyes. How about ""Until next time""? How about ""Until next time""? It's been a pleasure working with you, Commander. The feeling is mutual, ... Counsellor. I'm supposed to know how everyone feels, but... ..I can't read you right now. Perhaps your own feelings are getting in the way. My job is to help others with their emotions. My own feelings are beside the point. Not to me. Our feelings are what make us all human. Are you feeling sad? Yes, I am. So am I. He's relaxed. Experiencing feelings of... warmth and friendship. He's reliving memories. It's a side effect of neural stimulation. Look at this. The organism's metabolism has changed. Perhaps the stimulation is affecting them. I'm going to refocus the impulse pattern on the interpretative cortex. To intensify his memories? Exactly. We'll see if that affects the microbes. Everyone, we've brought the visitors. Please, enjoy what we have. Gentlemen, if this is what you call enhancement, ... ..you've got a gift for understatement. What's a knockout like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Waiting for you. Waiting for me? You can't be serious. Yes, Will. I've never been more serious in my life. Something wrong? No. It's just that Cmdr Riker's emotions are... rather passionate. As in erotic? Very much so. A dream? Is that what this is? Is that what I am? I know you're a computer-generated image, but... ..your smell, ... your touch, the way you feel, ... ..even the things you say and think seem so real. Thank you. How far can this relationship go? I mean, how real are you? As real as you need me to be. You resist. Don't you find me attractive? Yes, I find you very attractive. You attract me like no man has. It's not my function to seduce or be seduced by the leader of another world. It's not the reason. No. But will you still respect me tomorrow? I hope so. William, is something wrong? What do you mean? Do you not like girls? Of course I do. Is there a special technique to this foot washing? You generally start at the top and work your way down. I think I can handle that. I was hoping you might. The organisms responded alright. Their growth rate has doubled. Then all we've done is make things worse. So the growth rate is related to the memories he's experiencing. Or the emotions they produce. Different mental processes generate different chemicals. Perhaps the organisms are sensitive to brain endorphins. So if some types of endorphins attract them... Others will repel them. I'll change the differential current patterns, see what happens. We're not going without our crew. I warn you. People need attention. We won't hurt you, but we must help them. Number One? The creature attacked. Yar is down. It feeds on phaser energy. We had no effect on it. What's Lt Yar's condition? Dr Crusher, report! She's dead. I'm losing life signs. You must save him. I'm sorry. Growth rate has definitely slowed. What is he feeling? Can you tell? Sadness. Which is the opposite of before. With the opposite effect on the infection. Then your theory's correct. The organisms are sensitive to different types of endorphins. And negative emotions... Such as sadness... ..produce endorphins that inhibit the organism's growth. Then we can repel the infection. Assuming we're not too late. How much time do we have? I'm not sure. His vital signs are getting weaker. I can't risk another dose of tricordrazine unless I have to. I must refocus the pattern again. We need to isolate memories that generate stronger negative emotions. I know I can count on every Klingon warrior in this crew to serve and die in that battle. So, I ask you again, Cmdr Riker, where are your loyalties? I've been assigned to serve this ship and to obey your orders and I will do exactly that. You'll take an oath to that effect? I just did. This is your Second Officer, Lt Klag. Is there something you wanted to say? Yes, sir. I do not believe you. You challenge my authority over you? Correct. And your position on this, Captain? I would say it is your first command decision. Ready for your tour, Admiral? Quite ready, Commander. What's in the case? I brought it for Dr Crusher. Perhaps you would like to see it? What is it? A form of life. It was discovered accidentally by a survey team on an uncharted planet. Why haven't we heard about it? You will do shortly. First, there remains scientific study to be done. It is a superior form of life. Superior? Totally. Come, have a look. I'll summon my Science Officer. It won't like your Science Officer. It does like you! Vitamins. They do wonders for the body. Riker to Security. Guest quarters 17. Emergency. We've reduced the growth, but not enough. His vital signs are deteriorating. But we've isolated the specific areas to stimulate. The feelings were... primal. Survival emotions. They must produce an endorphin that poisons the organisms. Can't you intensify that emotion? I can refocus the impulse pattern even tighter. I don't know if he can withstand it. He's extremely weak. Do we have a choice? No. If we don't neutralize the infection, within half an hour he'll be dead. Medical log, supplemental. Cmdr Riker's condition is still critical. I've discovered a way to reverse the infection's growth, but I may be too late. He's getting weaker, isn't he? Respiration shallow, heartbeat irregular, but we can't delay. Take us home and leave us with our medicine, or he dies. Don't you see I have no choice? We were sent to bring felicium back. The suffering on my planet is too great. People are dying. Whether we are entitled to it or not, we must have it. Let him go. You will take us there now, or give us a shuttle, but we must have the medicine. If you refuse, this man will die. I will not be coerced. I will do it... I will kill him. Who are you? Data, something's got me! Touch him and he dies. No, don't! Enterprise? Armus has enveloped Cmdr Riker. I'm beaming you up. If any of you leave now, he dies. And so do the survivors of the crash. The growth rate's down to seven percent. The organisms are still impairing his neural functions. Respiration erratic, pulse irregular, blood pressure almost nil. Tricordrazine. Can we tighten the pattern further? Recognize Picard, Jean-Luc. Captain. Recognize Riker, William T. Commander. Set auto-destruct sequence. Does the First Officer concur? Yes. Set auto-destruct sequence. Now. Auto-destruct will detonate in four minutes and 59 seconds. I am Korris. We'll handle the formalities later. Right now we have to get off this ship. Any other survivors? No. I have found a quicker way out. Check him out. He is alive, but barely. Then pick up the body and let's go. No. I will carry him. As you wish. C'mon, let's go! Tasha, go to transporter room three. I want you there when they return. Aye, sir. Commander, this ship is blowing! Transporter room, have you got us? Too much interference. Get away from the engineering section. The engineering section's critical. Destruction is imminent. There are no options! Do it! Now! The growth rate's almost at zero. That's not good enough. We seek peaceful coexistence. Set auto-destruct. Data, something's got me! Auto-destruct... Now. Data, something's got me! Sickbay to bridge. Yes, Doctor? We've eradicated the infection. I'm on my way. You're still here? I could ask you the same question. How do you feel? Beat. You wouldn't believe my dreams. Yes, we would. You'll be pleased to hear we've terminated the infection. Great work, Doctor. Now, if I can get out of here, I'll return to... Lie still. I still have a few dozen tests to run. Why? I feel fine. There may be residual memory loss. I want to be certain you still know who you are. Of course I know who I am. I'm Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise. I'm delighted you're feeling better, ... Captain. The Admiral and I were worried about you. Captain, you do not have the authority to promote me to Admiral. "
S3E01,"Riker to Ensign Crusher. Go ahead. Forget to set your alarm, Wesley? Yes, sir. I'm very sorry. I'll be right there. Captain's log, stardate 43125.8. We have entered a spectacular binary star system in the Kavis Alpha Sector on a mission of astrophysical research. Our eminent guest, Dr Paul Stubbs, will attempt to study the decay of neutronium expelled at relativistic speeds from a massive stellar explosion which will occur here in a matter of hours. Ensign, our position? One million kilometers from the neutron star. Slow to one-third impulse power. Spectacular, isn't it, my friend? Yes, sir. Over and over again, the gravitational pull of the little neutron star sucks up the star material from the red giant, and it builds up on the surface until it explodes, every 196 years. Like clockwork. And it is but 1 8 hours away. 1 8 hours, seven minutes and ten seconds, Doctor. The interstellar counterpart to Earth's Old Faithful. The only predictable burst of energy in the universe that can accomplish our goal. If you'd like to make one final inspection... Captain, I have been inspecting the Egg for the last 20 years. You may lay it when ready. Begin launch sequence. Shuttlebay two, stand by to launch the Egg. Standing by, Commander. Five minutes to launch site. Stabilize! The ship isn't responding, sir. Engineering! Report, Mr La Forge. Checking inertial dampeners. Instruments say they're working. We're heading into the path of that stellar matter. Shields up. Negative. The shields will not respond. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. 30 seconds to impact, sir. Manual override on shields. Shields are rising. Reset dampeners, Mr La Forge. Not responding. Unable to reset. Reverse impulse engines. Initiating reverse sequence, now. Our momentum is still carrying us into the path of the stellar matter. 1 2 seconds to impact, sir. Prepare for impact. Medical personnel, report to the bridge. Cmdr Data, check all systems. Systems functioning normally. Computer, explain control malfunction. No control malfunction has been recorded. Lay down carefully. There you go. Dr Stubbs, the Captain says our systems are back to normal. We can try another launch when you're ready. Quite a dynamic family team, you Crushers. It's nice to be together again. I was at Starfleet Medical for a year. I missed two inches of him. I'm not sure I'd want my mother to be flying through space with me. No, I take that back. I am sure. I wouldn't want her. My mother is a formidable woman, too. A woman of letters. A great critic. I know. Good Lord, son, you didn't read that unauthorized biography? Is this all he does? Fly the ship and read? Doesn't he have fun? Sure he does. Most of my free time is taken up with my studies. I want to get into Starfleet Academy. I earn credits being on the Enterprise. But it's not the same. You ready to sit up? Well, I am whole again. Thank you, Doctor. Come along, Wesley, let's go see if Humpty-Dumpty is in one piece. Computer, fix the food slot. The food slot is functioning properly. Well, check again. The food slot is functioning properly. Deactivate food slot. We're analyzing the systems data. There's nothing unusual in the computer log for that time period. Run a level-one diagnostic series. Come. I want a computer that's 100 percent to expedite Dr Stubbs' experiment as well as the food slots in sickbay. Picard out. Which are working again, for the moment. What can I do for you, Doctor? Jean-Luc, how would you feel if you were a 17-year-old and the only Starfleet officer whose mother was on board? Inhibited, I suppose. But then, I'm not Wesley. If you are concerned about him, I see no evidence of a problem. I know, but, in a funny way, that's exactly my point. We talk, we smile. It's almost too polite. Beverly, isn't it just a matter of time? I know how difficult it was for you being away. Tell me about him. Well, he's becoming a very fine officer. He works as hard as any member of the crew. His studies are on line. No! Tell me about him. He's his father's son. Honest, trusting, strong. Does he have many friends? Has he ever been in love? Jean-Luc, I'm worried. He's come so far, so fast, and since I've been back, I don't feel... His dependence. Beverly, look, he's 17 years old. What were you doing when you were 1 7? Getting into more trouble than Wesley. So was I. Isn't that what 1 7 is supposed to be? No cracks in the amour. We'll do just fine. How can you be so calm? If I were about to make a breakthrough... I have never doubted for a moment that this day would come. And I suspect that someday it will come for you as well. I see a lot of me in you. In my youth, they called me a wunderkind. Do you understand wunderkind? It's German, isn't it? It means ""wonder child"". It is reserved for those of us who achieve early in life. Now the burden is yours. Burden? To fulfill your potential. You will never come up against a greater adversary than your own potential. Red alert. Return to quarters. Still no visual contact. That's impossible. Mr Worf, same magnification, 50 degrees starboard. Worf, you're absolutely sure? Sensors indicate the approach of a Borg vessel. Shields up. Shields are not responding. Manual override is jammed. We don't have the shields, Captain. They're firing energy weapons! Evasive action. Bring her round to 275, mark three. Predict vector of Borg vessel. Vector... ...is gone! And so is the Borg ship. Is this another computer glitch? It could be a synthetically-generated image. Our computer was daydreaming? Computer, identify malfunction. Pawn to bishop four. Knight to king's rook three. Bishop to queen's bishop four. Knight to knight five. Queen's knight... Controls are not responding, sir. Queen to bishop three. Impulse engines are down. Try warp engines. No. Sorry. I'd better get back to Engineering. Mr La Forge, I want Lt Worf to accompany you. Report on the prospects of getting our shields back. Number One, Mr Data, join me in the conference room. It's time to discuss the future of this mission, if there still is one. We are dealing with the potential breakdown of the main computer. That's hard to accept. The system provides for self-correction. There has been no systems-wide technological failure on a starship in 79 years. Excuse me, Captain, Dr Stubbs is waiting outside. Captain, I'm sure you have everything under control. I'd just like to know what's going on. Of course, Doctor. Sit down. Counselor. Cmdr La Forge is attempting repairs even as we speak. ""Attempting"" doesn't sound particularly reassuring. If possible, we will continue this mission as planned. Captain, if we miss our chance now, we don't get another for two centuries. Starfleet will ask many questions if the Enterprise fails in its duty. Nevertheless, my foremost consideration is to ensure the safety of this ship and its crew. Ensure the safety, Captain? Or are you really talking about playing it safe? Doctor, in our current position, when that star explodes, you'll get to watch your experiment from the inside out. I would rather die than leave. You don't speak for the majority of the crew. I know how much this means to you. My dear Counselor, no insult intended, but please turn off your beam into my soul. I will share the feelings I wish to share. Well, if we do not leave in time, so be it. It's one sure way into the record books, eh? His nonchalance is studied and practiced. Even my sensory perception picked that up! He's put his entire self-worth on the line with this experiment. It's the truth when he says he'd rather die than leave. Call up the cross-section of core processor 451. I want to see elements 0200 to 0300. Aye, sir. In order to get some power, I had to essentially hot-wire the connection. Whoa, right there. Look at that lesion. No wonder we're coming apart. It's some kind of continuing disintegration, but from what, I can't tell. I have no idea how to stop it. It's just a mechanical problem? Increase magnification, factor 50. I don't know, Wes. But looking at it... You know, if I didn't know any better, I'd say somebody had climbed in and started taking it apart. Guinan! I didn't think anyone would be here. I'm no good at being confined to quarters, as my husbands will attest to. What's that? I'm just setting traps. I run a clean place. I know. It's not that. It's... I'm scared, Guinan. I think that everything that's gone wrong might be my fault. Want to tell me about it? I'm doing my final project for advanced genetics. It's on nanotechnology. I studied the nanites in the sickbay supplies. These tiny robots with gigabytes of mechanical computer memory. They're designed to enter living cells and conduct repairs. They're supposed to stay confined to the lab. There are nanites loose? Two of them, that's all. I wanted to see how they'd function in tandem. I had proposed a theory that by working together, they could combine their skills and be more useful. It was working. You made better nanites? I was pulling an all-nighter to collect my final data. I fell asleep. When I woke up, I saw the container had been left open. It's just a science project. A doctor friend once said the same thing to me. Frankenstein was his name. They're really harmless. They have only basic skills. It's almost impossible they're responsible. Almost. Dr Crusher to Wesley Crusher. Go ahead. I assumed you'd be in your quarters since you're off duty. I know. I just had some things to do. Orders are orders, Mr Crusher. On my way. You won't tell anybody, will you? I know. I will. If it's true. Wes, do you think you're gonna get a good grade? I always get an A. So did Dr Frankenstein. Captain's log, supplemental. Our computer core has been tampered with, yet there is no sign of a breach of security. We will attempt to complete our mission, but without a reliable computer, Dr Stubbs' experiment is in jeopardy. Manual restart sequence. Restart successful. Impulse engine functions appear normal. Shuttlebay two, open hangar door. Aye, sir. Door did not respond. Repeating sequence. What in heaven's name? It is Stars and Stripes Forever by John Philip Sousa, an American composer from the 20th century. I know that! Computer, shut off the music. The music is on all communications channels. Weapons, power, communications. Our systems are being stripped. Shut off power to bridge! Cmdr La Forge, can you get us out of this star system safely? No! Not now, Doctor. I'll try. I don't want to overload the engines. Do it gently. But do it. We'll circuit in power to bridge and silence any Sousa encores. The priority is to find out who or what is doing this. Number One, the bridge, such as it is, is yours. The Egg that Stubbs laid. No one will say that. Nobody will say anything at all. We will not even be mentioned. I could live with failure. Well, maybe not. But never even to try, to miss your one chance at bat. Do you know baseball? Yes. My father taught me when I was young. Once, centuries ago, it was the beloved national pastime of the Americas, Wesley. Abandoned by a society that prized fast food and faster games. Lost to impatience. But I have seen the great players make the great plays. Do you recreate them on a holodeck? No. In here. With the knowledge of statistics, runs, hits and errors, times at bat, box scores. Men like us do not need holodecks, Wesley. I have played seasons in my mind. It was my reward to myself for patience. Knowing my turn would come. Call your shot. Point to a star. One great blast, and the crowd rises. A brand-new era in astrophysics... ...postponed 196 years... ...on account of rain. We have to talk. You really look like you could use some rest. I know. It's OK. Really. No, it's not OK. Really. Mom, I'm checking traps to find out what's happening to the Enterprise. On someone's orders? We're running out of time for Dr Stubbs. You can't put everything on your shoulders. You're always on duty. Mom, you don't understand. You are a 17-year-old. I am also an acting officer. I have responsibilities. I'm beginning to think you've taken on too many responsibilities. I have done everything everyone has asked of me and more. How can you know? You haven't been here! I'm here now, Wesley. Come on. I'll help you. What are you looking for? I think I've made a horrible mistake. Nanites. Tiny machines built from the atom up. Designed for exposure to the inside of nuclei during surgeries. Until then, they are tightly contained in a non-functioning state. These are not ordinary nanites. No. They have evolved. Evolved? How does a machine evolve? It's true. I am responsible for this. I allowed two of the nanites to interact for a school project. I wanted to increase their capabilities. And they escaped. School project? Just how far have these things evolved? Well... this is a sample of linear memory-crystal from our computer core. It's like candy to them. They can mechanically replicate themselves. It is conceivable that with each generation, they enhance their design, at an extraordinary rate of evolution. How many generations are we dealing with? Engineering, display computer core processor 451, element 0299. Increase magnification, factor 1,000. Can they know what they're doing? Why would they attack us? Why does a mosquito bite your ear? And who cares? The answer is simple. Call an exterminator. Dr Stubbs, these nanites are now working with a new collective intelligence. Operating together. Teaching each other new skills. Oh, really! I'm sorry, but this is nonsense. You can't have a civilisation of computer chips. They're made in a plant in Dakar, Senegal. I've watched the construction. Then how do you explain what we've just seen here? It's no more mysterious than watching a strain of Leutscher virus reproduce itself. That at least is a bona fide life form. How many disease germs and viruses have you destroyed in your time, Dr Crusher? We cannot exterminate something that may or may not be intelligent. My good Captain... There's still time. Ensign, will you work with Mr Data to try to remove them safely? If things get worse, we'll use stronger measures. Gentlemen, I need a computer that is 100 percent in less than eight hours, and we still have core reconstruction to consider. We're trying low-gamma bursts to slow down their productivity. Have you considered a high-level charge? That would kill them, Doctor. I know. I can't get the story of Gulliver out of my head. Overpowered by Lilliputians. How long do we have to wait? We can bypass the part of the computer that's affected, but if the nanites are spreading through the whole ship... Do you smell a change...? What...? Picard to La Forge, environmental system malfunction on the bridge. Nitrogen oxide. Toxic levels. Working on it. I've switched to manual control of the air-handling system. Mr Worf, report. He sterilized one of the processors with gamma radiation. The nanites in the upper core are all dead. You have no choice now. It is a matter of survival. Dr Stubbs, if you were a member of my crew... But I am not a member of your crew. I am a representative of the highest command of the Federation, which has directed you to perform my experiment. If any man, woman or child on this ship is harmed as a result of your experiment, I will have your head before Federation Command. Good Lord, you are talking about machines with a screw loose! Simply turn them off and be done with them. Dr Stubbs, your own actions have provided evidence to the contrary. When you destroyed the nanites, they responded by interfering with our life support. These are not random actions by machines with loose screws. You may have proven that the nanites have a collective intelligence. The ship is at risk. Extermination may be our only choice. Good point. Lt Worf, I want Dr Stubbs confined to his quarters until further notice. Mr Data, can you find me some way to communicate with these things? With intelligence, there is the capability of language. It will depend on how far their evolution has brought them. We could modify the universal translator to make it capable of communications with them. Proceed. May I come in? You just can't resist, can you, Counselor? I only want to help. Yes. To break the shell. To get in touch with my true feelings. I'm only worried about your state of mind. Alright, Counselor, what is it that has you so worried? Your single-mindedness, your need to have this experiment work. But it will. Picard has no choice now. He must defend the Enterprise. Counselor, when this is all over, I will show you New Manhattan on Beth Delta I as you have never seen it, and we will laugh over glasses of champagne. Your self-portrait is so practiced, so polished. Yes. Isn't it, though? It's stretched so tight, the tension fills this room. And if you finally fail, I fear it will snap. A good try, Counselor. But sometimes, when you reach beneath a man's self-portrait, as you so eloquently put it, deep down inside what you find is nothing at all. Lockman on first. Dark on second. Thompson at the plate. Branca on the mound. He's coming around. I cannot believe this was an arbitrary attack. Has Data been able to contact them? Picard! You must protect me. Kill them! Cmdr Riker. On my signal, we will gamma-irradiate all our computer systems. Let's put an end to this conflict. Worf, prepare to activate gamma-pulse generators. Electromagnetic scanners ready, Captain. Captain. I have established contact. They are virtually learning the concept of communication. Each generation is making modifications. Can we talk to them yet? I believe it is worth an attempt. Cmdr Riker, bring Dr Stubbs to the bridge. I don't think this is a wise idea. They have already tried to kill me once. One sure way into the record books, Doctor. I am ready, sir. Tell them the human who destroyed their comrades will address them. Captain... You will explain your error and apologize, and pray we can negotiate a peace we can all live with. Is that clear? Captain, if a face-to-face negotiation would be helpful, I will volunteer to be a conduit. Yourself, Data? I can furnish the nanites with a schematic design of my neurological structure. It would require no more than their basic skills. That's what they were designed for. They could penetrate my hand covering, enter my nerve circuitry and interface with my verbal program. If they have control of a commander, they're an even greater threat. How can we be sure that we can get them out of you? It would be a considerable risk, but would be a gesture of trust. It could be a step toward peace. Alright, Data. Propose it to the nanites. The answer is yes. They are ready, Captain. Proceed. You are very strange-looking creatures. In our travels we have encountered many other creatures, perhaps even stranger-looking than ourselves. But we try to coexist peacefully. Why did you attack us? We misinterpreted your actions as an attack on us. We were seeking raw materials for our replicating process. Yes, but you endangered this vessel. You nearly killed a crew member. We meant no harm. We were... exploring. I understand. We are also explorers. We mean no harm to any other living creature. I am the one responsible for the deaths in the computer core. We know... who you are. I deeply regret the incident. I am a scientist on an important mission. Your colleagues' exploration put our mission at risk. I was only trying to protect a lifetime of work from being destroyed. I am at your mercy. What is ""at your mercy""? He asks your forgiveness. This conflict was started by mistakes on both sides. Let's agree to end it here and now. We... ...agree. I pledge we will do everything possible to assist your continued survival. Thank you. But we have evolved beyond any need for your assistance. This ship is too confining. We require relocation. Captain's log, supplemental. Dr Stubbs has used his influence to have planet Kavis Alpha IV designated the home of the nanite civilisation. Cmdr Data's neural network has been vacated. He has been returned to us unharmed. With the help of the nanites, our computer has been reconstructed in time for the experiment. Ten seconds to stellar blast. 40 million kilometers from the neutron star. Hold your position. Doctor? Do you have any children, Guinan? A lot. Ever had trouble relating to them? Just one. One? Wouldn't listen to anybody. Well, they all go through that. Not in a species of listeners. Did he grow out of it? It took several hundred years, but I brought him round. How? A mother shapes her child in ways she doesn't even realize. Sometimes just by listening. Cute couple. See? Now that is healthy for a boy his age. I mean that as a doctor, not as just a mother. It is so good to see him having fun for a change, with an attractive young woman who obviously looks at him with extraordinary affection. What do you know about this girl? "
S3E02,"Captain. Doctor. I am honored by your presence, but may I suggest you attend the second concert? Why, Data? Ensign Ortiz will perform the violin part. My rendition will be less enjoyable. I am technically proficient, but according to my fellow performers, I lack soul. Telling us why you'll fail before making the attempt is never wise. But is not honesty always the preferred choice? Excessive honesty can be disastrous, particularly in a commander. Indeed? Knowing your limitations is one thing. Advertising them to a crew damages your credibility as a leader. Because you will lose their confidence? And you may begin to believe in those limitations yourself. Captain, we're receiving a message from the Sheliak Corporate. Origin of message confirmed. It is from the Shelia star system. The Sheliak have not communicated with the Federation for 111 years. Why are they doing it now? On screen. Federation creatures, there are humans on the fifth planet of Tau Cygna. This planet was ceded to the Corporate in section 1 33 paragraph 77 of the Treaty of Armens. We will begin settlement of this world in four days. Remove the humans. What the...? Federation creatures, there are humans on the fifth planet... Cancel message. Tau Cygna V is in the de Laure Belt. Heavy concentrations of hyperonic radiation. Humans can't survive there. Hyperonic radiation is fatal. Then the Sheliak are asking us to chase ghosts. No, Number One. The Sheliak haven't broken a century of silence to send us after phantoms. An investigation is in order. Set course for Tau Cygna V. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain, human-life-form readings from the planet. The Sheliak weren't hallucinating. Numbers? Impossible to get a reading. Radiation is disrupting our sensors. Radiation has also made the ship's transporters inoperable. So are the phasers. How can humans survive there? They must have adapted. Work with radiation sensitivity suggests it's possible. Perhaps with extensive viral therapy. Whoever they are, we've gotta get them off the planet. By treaty, that world still belongs to the Sheliak. Who are within their rights to remove these trespassers. If we don't remove them, the Sheliak will. Forcefully. How forcefully? The Sheliak consider humans a lower life form and would have no compunctions about exterminating them. Mr Data, as you're unaffected by hyperonic radiation, I'd like you to go to the planet via shuttlecraft to commence evacuation. Aye, sir. Number One. Any speculation on what we might find down there? My guess would be a lone survey craft. Maybe a dozen or so survivors. I think it's some sort of shuttlecraft. Where's it from? Look at the markings. It must be from the Federation. Greetings, gentlemen. We saw your ship. You're the first visitor we've had... The first visitor we've ever had. You're not human. That is correct. I am an android. I am Lt Cmdr Data of the Federation Starship Enterprise. Our great-grandparents were in the Federation. You don't wanna waste time talking to us. You should meet Gosheven. We'll take you. I'm sure the Federation will be proud of us. Wait till you see all we've accomplished. And who precisely is ""us""? Don't you know? Oh no, I don't guess you would. We're descendants of the original settlers, from the colony ship Artemis. Got it. The Artemis. Launched 92 years ago for Septimus Minor. When they failed to check in, Starfleet began a huge search. What took the Artemis off course? My local informant does not know. In the early days, survival was more important than history. Understood. How many are they? 1 5,253, sir. 1 5,000! Three days, no transporters. We'll never get them out in time. Shuttles? Loading all shuttlecraft to capacity, evacuation will take... four weeks, four days. We need more time. Mr Data, prepare the colonists for evacuation. Aye, sir. Get me the Sheliak. Their homeworld is quite distant. This will take some time. Gosheven, look what's come. Lt Cmdr Data of the Starship Enterprise. He's an android. So he is. Well, now that you're here, what do you want? My mission is to prepare this colony for evacuation. Why? Because this planet belongs to the Sheliak. And who is the Sheliak? The term is plural. The Sheliak are a non-humanoid intelligent life form, class R3. Well, this colony has been here over 90 years. We've never seen a Sheliak. I'd say that makes Tau Cygna V our planet. The original destination of the Artemis was Septimus Minor. The guidance system failed. Took them far off course. Our ancestors were lucky to land anywhere. Then the radiation started killing them. It killed a third of the colonists before they adapted to it. Our colony prospered. Look around. We've brought water to the desert, built a community. Your accomplishments are truly remarkable. Yet there is a treaty which makes this planet Sheliak domain. Then change the treaty. That may not be possible. The Sheliak wish to colonize this planet and will not share it with humans. If you are here when they arrive, they will eradicate you. They'd kill all of us? They have little regard for human life. The sensible thing is to prepare a contingency plan for the evacuation of your people. We're not evacuating. I have not made myself clear. Yes, you have. Let me be equally clear. There's going to be no evacuation. You've delivered your message, so go back to your ship. I have work to do. Nice catch. Wonderful reflexes. Sorry to test you like that, but I was curious. Found a new toy, have we? Toy? This is the most incredible android I've ever seen. Have you seen many? Actually, no. You're the first. Only you would get this excited over a walking calculator. Cybernetics fascinates me. Are your neural paths duotronic? No. Positronic. Is that possible? What's your memory capacity? How many operations per second? I have a million questions. I have no time to answer a million. I have a mission to accomplish. I must know about your people. Gosheven seems unwilling to talk. I'm Ard'rian McKenzie. Perhaps I can help you. Gentlemen, we're giving you an assignment. One thing we don't want to hear is that it's impossible. I need the transporters to work despite the radiation. Yeah, but that's im... Yes, sir. Even if we get the Sheliak to talk, they won't be accommodating. When the treaty was first negotiated, the Federation sent 372 legal experts. What do we have? Thee and me? No response. Try them again. Boost the signal strength. Sheliak Corporate. This is the Starship Enterprise. Respond, please. Conversation is neither required nor desired. Conversation is necessary if we are to find a solution to our mutual problem. Our involvement in Federation illegality is not indicated. Both parties are involved, sir. Remove the humans from the Tau Cygna system. Three Earth days remain. Let us negotiate in good faith. Negotiate to what purpose? The treaty is signed. There is a thriving colony on that planet. Rather than uproot these people, may I offer a compromise? Denied. Why? The law is paramount. We are entitled. This is not a law. It is a treaty. It is designed to smooth relations between races, not to act as a strait... ...jacket. You really think we'll have to leave Tau Cygna V? The possibility exists, yet Gosheven seems unwilling to prepare for it. Why? Maybe because you're an android. I don't think he likes the idea of machines ordering him around. I am not ordering him. I am trying to persuade him to evacuate his people. Do you think my course of action should be followed? Of course. Despite the fact I am an android? Because of that fact. I'm not prejudiced against computers. I like them. Not that any computer we have is as sophisticated as you. No, I would say not. People can be selfish, irrational, stubborn, malicious. But computers don't have those failings. And you conclude that I am impartial? Hence, you accept my recommendations? Yet Gosheven does not. Picard to Cmdr Data. Data here. The Sheliak won't bargain. Understood, sir. I'm calling for transport. Get those people ready to evacuate quickly. Aye, sir. We must speak to Gosheven immediately. Gentlemen, how's it coming? What the hell is that? Our first attempt. Keep at it. We need those transporters. You see this? Do you have any idea what it is, or what it means? It is water. A substance composed of two atoms of hydrogen... It's not water. It's blood and sweat. The result of 90 years of combined effort. This isn't a town. It's a monument to everyone who's lived and died here. You're talking nonsense. Am I? My grandfather is buried on that mountain. He died in a rock slide surveying for this aqueduct. This colony exists because of his sacrifice and the sacrifice of thousands of others. No, we are not leaving. The Sheliak will not accept humans on their planet. They will use force to remove you. We will not be bullied off our land. Not by you, and not by the Sheliak. Stubborn and irrational. Now what do we do? Are his sentiments typical? I hope not. If I can convince people to leave... Don't you mean if we can convince? Come. Yes, sir. Three weeks. Starfleet is profuse in its apologies, but it will still be three weeks until the arrival of a transport ship equipped with dedicated personnel shuttles. We can't wait three weeks. Then the Sheliak must agree to extend our deadline. They plan to settle Tau Cygna V two days from now. One of their ships must already be en route. We're going to intercept that ship. The Sheliak may see that as hostile. A risk we have to take. The Enterprise is going to intercept the Sheliak ship. Now, your job... Well, you know what your job is. Commander. In human parlance, I do not believe I can get the job done. My training prepared me for starship command duties. As a cultural contact, I am less than exemplary. What's the situation? Their leader will not listen. He denies my arguments and speaks of structures they have built. Try something else. I have, sir. In the last three hours, I have spoken with 56 colonists. Ten refused to believe the threat exists. 22 favor staying and fighting the Sheliak. 1 6 prefer negotiation or some sort of passive resistance. Only eight considered evacuation. Of those... Data, I can't help you. I haven't talked to these people. You have. Use your positronic brain to carry out your mission. Sir, if I do not succeed, how violent is the Sheliak reaction likely to be? Only the treaty stopped them from eradicating the colony the moment they discovered it. Ah. ""Ah"" is right, Data. The lives of 1 5,000 people are riding on you. You'd better get innovative. Riker out. Data? We're having an effect. People are asking questions. Gosheven has called a meeting. Has Gosheven changed his position? No. But you can present your recommendations. So far, my attempts at persuasion have been ineffective. Why did you do that? You appeared to need it. Among humans, a kiss usually serves to seal a friendship, or indicate support, attraction, affection. In this context, I must assume that your intention was to express support. You don't understand human behavior. That is an understatement. Sometimes I don't either. Androids are a lot more rational. That quality has not helped me to accomplish my mission. A rational argument isn't always enough. Maybe, to be more persuasive, you should use reverse psychology. Elicit a desired behavior by advocating its opposite. That implies deception. A little. But if it helps us get our point across... Perhaps this is a situation where excessive honesty can be detrimental. Are we progressing? About like you'd expect, sir. Splendid! Carry on. He wants the impossible. That's the short definition of ""Captain"". You all know the android from Starfleet, and you've been discussing why he's come. I called this meeting to replace misinformation with cold hard fact. I wish to speak. No. Leave now. Is your position so weak that it cannot withstand debate? Let him speak. You all know of the Sheliak threat. Starfleet wishes to evacuate you for your own protection. Yet Gosheven has decided otherwise. That is his right. I will not waste time trying to reverse that decision. I admire your conviction in the face of certain defeat. Though doomed, your effort will be valiant. And when you die, you will die for land and for honor. Your children will understand that they are dying for a worthy cause. Long after the battle is over, their courage will be remembered and extolled. Remembered by who? Yes, that is true. There will be no one left alive to remember. A valiant try, android. But what a low opinion you must have of us. I wanted to describe your destruction in a manner with an emotional effect. He describes it pretty damn well. Are you ready to follow this machine? Give up without a fight? He says we're going to lose. That's his cowardice talking. What if he's right? Shouldn't we consider that possibility? This colony exists because generations gave their lives for it. Many died before we could adapt to the radiation. Many more died bringing water to this desert. My grandfather... ...is buried on that mountain. Who'll be left to bury you? Have you considered what this evacuation means? Everything we have, we abandon. Everything that we have built turns to dust. Everything that we have accomplished means nothing. I say no. You elected me your leader. Follow me now. I don't think our chances are as hopeless as he says. And I'm willing to stake our lives on it. Any objections? Good. Because here we stand. Aye. We stand with you. Then here you die. Mr Data, I want you to know that Gosheven doesn't speak for all of us. I see no reason to die needlessly. And you? I'm not sure. Gosheven's done well for us. But I want to hear more of what you have to say. Others feel the same, but they are uneasy about confronting Gosheven. Get them together and we'll meet at my house. With other non-humanoid races, there's always been some point of reference. Not so with the Sheliak. We must have something in common. We communicate. Barely. They have learnt several Federation languages, but theirs continues to elude us. Telepaths. Attempted and failed. Actually, the fact that any alien race communicates with another is quite remarkable. We are stranded on a planet. We have no language in common, but I want to teach you mine. S'marith. What did I just say? Cup? Glass? Are you sure? I may have meant liquid, clear, brown, hot. We conceptualize the universe in relatively the same way. Point taken. In your talks, you must be extremely accurate. The treaty is 500,000 words. The length was to accommodate the Sheliak. They consider our language irrational and wanted this level of complexity to avoid future misunderstandings. Captain, we have the vessel carrying the Sheliak on visual. On my way. So, it begins. Hailing frequencies. Open. This is Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise. Your purpose, Enterprise? We desire face-to-face negotiations to settle the crisis on Tau Cygna V. Meaningless. We're entitled to consultation under paragraph 653, subparagraph nine. Granted. Was that an invitation? I am taking it as such. Counselor. You have the bridge, Number One. Helm, maintain relative position. Mr Worf, tell transporter room two to stand by. Aye, sir. Once the Federation resettles us, we'll be left alone? If you so desire. We do. We like to do things on our own. The Federation will offer as little or as much help as you want. Kentor, are you with us? Yes. The question is how do we convince Gosheven? Why do we need to? He's respected. Most people will do what he says. They respect you, too. If you take a stand, they'll fall in line. I don't know. Gosheven's got a lot of supporters. Don't forget that. I'm disappointed. I thought we'd settled this. Apparently, that is not correct. Still stirring up trouble? Since when is talk trouble? It's over. Don't you get it? You had your say. You lost. I appear to be reversing that defeat. No, you're not. You're just stubborn. Well, let me tell you something. So am I. Damn you, Gosheven! You killed him! I killed no one. I merely shut down a machine. That's it, everyone. It's time to go home. You'll see that I'm right. Advance and speak. Director... ...we will comply with your request to remove the colony from Tau Cygna V, but we need time. The given time has elapsed. We carry the membership. We will proceed with their debarkation. The temporary presence of humans won't interfere with your plans. Unacceptable. You must remove the creatures. I'm trying, but the ship isn't available for three weeks. Then you are in violation. I have admitted that. I am only asking for a little flexibility. Section 501, paragraph 7 1 6, subparagraph five. ""Unwanted life forms inhabiting H-Class worlds may be removed at the discretion of the Sheliak Corporate."" We will remove them, but you must grant us the time we require. You need time, Picard? We will save you time. We will eradicate the human infestation. They are not vermin! I will not permit this outrage. Intelligent converse is impossible. You do not discuss. You gibber. Between intelligent species of goodwill... I take it the Sheliak just hung up on us again. I was afraid your neural pathways were scrambled. I have diagnostic circuits and am able to correct many malfunctions. I'm not surprised at Gosheven. But Kentor and the others said they were with us. I guess words don't mean much. Perhaps that is our difficulty. Words are all we have been using. Humans seem to take much stronger notice of actions. I require a phaser. What's a phaser? A type of weapon. Unfortunately, it does not function around hyperonic radiation. I will have to be innovative. Hyperonic radiation randomizes phaser beams. I think I can improvise a circuit which will compensate by continuously recollimating the output. You're using your own neural processors to build a smarter phaser. Essentially correct. Get word to Gosheven. Tell him I am coming to the pumping station. Tell him I am going to destroy the aqueduct. He'll try and stop you. I sincerely hope so. Go to yellow alert. Shields up. Aye, sir. Riker, keep close to the Sheliak vessel. Match any move she makes. Aye, sir. Mr Worf, hailing frequency. Open. They are not responding. They don't have to answer. They just have to listen. Sheliak vessel, you will have to get past me to get at the colony on Tau Cygna V. No response. Close channel. Get me that treaty. They've beat us over the head with it for three days. Let's find something in it that we can turn to our own advantage. Stop! That was the stun setting. This is not. I can reduce this pumping station to a pile of debris, but I trust my point is clear. I am but one android with a single weapon. There are hundreds of Sheliak on the way. Their weapons are far more powerful. They may not offer you a target. They can obliterate you from orbit. You will die never having seen the faces of your killers. The choice is yours. There are other places, other challenges. Yes, listen to Kentor. I really was willing to stay here and die for this. I know that. This is just a thing, and things can be replaced. Lives cannot. This is hopeless. Fighting would be preferable. That's it. I don't follow you, sir. Mr Worf, get me the Sheliak. Yes, sir. Coming through, sir. Pursuant to paragraph 1,290, I hereby request third-party arbitration of our dispute. You have the right. Furthermore, pursuant to subsection D3, I name the Grisellas to arbitrate. Grisellas? Unfortunately, they are hibernating now. They'll awaken in six months, at which time we can settle this. Now, do you want to wait or give me my three weeks? Absurd. We carry the membership. We can brook no delay. Then I hereby declare this treaty in abeyance. Wait! Negotiation is permiss... You enjoyed that. You're damned right. Captain, they are hailing us. Sir? On screen. You may have your three weeks, Picard of the Enterprise. Thank you. Captain, we can do it. We can modify the transporters. Excellent. It'll take 15 years and 1 00 researchers. Mr La Forge, I believe we will postpone. Yes, sir. Lt Cmdr Data to Enterprise. I am about to leave Tau Cygna V and await rendezvous instructions. Acknowledged. Stand by. Hi. The evacuation plan is going well. When the ship arrives, we'll be ready to leave. You succeeded. I only succeeded with your support and insight. I am grateful for your assistance. Good. Then you won't forget me. I am incapable of forgetting. I will remember every detail of my visit with perfect clarity. But nothing more? I do not understand. I guess what I really want to know is... ...do you have any feelings for me? I have no feelings of any kind. No, of course you don't. What was that for? You appeared to need it. So you saw that I was unhappy and did what you concluded would make me feel better? Rational to the last. Bye. Come. Welcome home. Well done. Thank you, sir. The good Doctor provided me with a recording of your concert. Your performance shows... feeling. As I have recently reminded others, sir, I have no feeling. It's hard to believe. Your playing is quite beautiful. Strictly speaking, sir, it is not my playing. It is a precise imitation of Jascha Heifetz and Trenka Bronkin. Is there nothing of Data in what I'm hearing? You see, you chose the violinists. Heifetz and Bronkin have radically different styles and techniques, yet you combined them successfully. I suppose I have learned to be creative, sir. When necessary. Mr Data, I look forward to your next concert. "
S3E03,"Captain's log, stardate 43152.4. We are entering the Delta Rana star system, after a distress call from the Federation colony on its fourth planet. The transmission reported an attack by an unidentified spacecraft. Our mission is one of rescue and, if necessary, confrontation with a hostile force. Shields up, maximum strength. Shields up. Sensors do not indicate the presence of any armed space vehicles. They could be cloaked. Mr Crusher, keep us clear of the planet's three moons. Aye, sir. Captain, we have lost Rana IV's call sign. Open a frequency to Colony Operations. No response. Rana IV is emissions-quiet. There are 1 1,000 inhabitants in this colony. At this range, I should sense something. I don't. Mr Data, put the planet on the main viewer. Magnify. My God! Helm, put us in a high equatorial orbit. Scan for survivors. Scanning 90 degrees of longitude as we orbit. No sign of water, vegetation, artificial structures. Life-form readings are negative. Could the colonists have escaped? Unlikely. Rana IV had no interstellar spacecraft. Who would cause such devastation? Hold it... Captain, I've got something here. 37 degrees north and 62 degrees east. It's a structure. Life? Two life forms, possibly human. Put it on the main viewer. Magnify. The structure is located at the centre of the vegetation, sir. An entire planet obliterated, but for a few acres of trees and a building. Must be an illusion. Negative. It is as you see it. Number One. I think you'd better see who's at home. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. As survivors of a nuclear holocaust, they can't be in good shape. I understand. Counselor? What I sense of them is human. And something else? It's difficult to explain. I feel... there is something different about these two people. Sorry, I can't be clearer than that. We're ready. Good luck, Number One. Energize. Geordi, what can you tell me? The house is a typical settlement structure with adaptations. Thermal properties all seem to conform to known materials. If there are any indicators why this area has remained intact, I cannot detect them. Worf, the interior of the house? There is one individual at the south end, the other toward the north. There is a weapon. A low-yield phaser, non-functional, near the front-room individual. So a frontal assault is unwarranted. Stay here. I'll try an old-fashioned knock at the door. Wait! There's something concealed... What are you doing? This is private property. Who are you? I'm Cmdr William Riker, of the USS Enterprise. Crew members. May I come down and approach? You leave him where he is. Should I incapacitate him? No. We're a rescue party. We picked up your distress call and came as fast as we could. Kevin! Kevin, what are you doing? Can't you see they're here to help? They're human! Go back in the house. This could be a trick. We almost gave up. We were afraid the Federation had been attacked. What about the colony? Do you know of others? It's been days since we've seen or heard anybody. No, don't. Don't tell me we're the only ones. Their spaceship was so big you could see it in orbit. They took our world apart. Who? We don't know. We never saw their faces. You don't know where they are now? I guess they've gone away. I'm sorry. I'm only performing a physical. Could I have your names for the record? I'm Rishon Uxbridge. This is my husband Kevin. Botanists from the aquatic city New Martim Vaz, in Earth's Atlantic. Residents of Rana IV for five years. You, madam, are 82 and a composer of Tao classical music. You, sir, are 85, a specialist in symbiotic plant life. You have been married 53 years. I memorized the colony register on the way in the event that information was needed. Is something wrong? With your permission, I'd like to look inside. Why? What could interest you in there? Mr Uxbridge, as far as we know, you, your wife and this house are all that survived that attack. That's either a bizarre coincidence or by design. I don't favor coincidence. Are you saying that we were kept alive intentionally? Yes. I don't understand. You don't think Rishon and I did something... ...to merit survival? I mean, betrayed the others? I'm not accusing you of anything, Mr Uxbridge. The attacking force spared you. We'd like to know why. Now, may I go inside? I'll make everyone a nice cup of tea. We have lovely tea here on Rana. It grows wild almost every... Sir. May I say your attempt to hold us at bay with a non-functioning weapon was an act of unmitigated gall. Didn't fool you, huh? I admire gall. Go ahead, pick it up. It's a music box. It's been in my family for generations. Nothing unusual about this house. Except the fact it's here. What about them? In reasonable health, but showing signs of stress. Understandable, After what they've been through. Somehow, they're different. Let's get back to the ship. We'll take them. Excuse me. We have to return to our ship. I haven't finished fixing tea. I'm sorry. I can allow time for you and Kevin to pack. What do you mean? You're not thinking of taking us? Surely you can't remain here. How can you care for yourselves? Kevin, I can't leave my home. No one's going to make us. You could be in danger on Rana. Commander, we appreciate your concern but we're not going. We'll manage. We always have. Alright. I can't make you come with us. Are you familiar with one of these? We'll be in the system for several days. If you reconsider, contact us. We'll be fine, Commander. We have each other. Are they collaborators? Did they provide the colony's assailants with something that abetted the destruction of Rana IV in order to protect their own lives? What did two botanists in their 80s possess that could aid the attackers? We don't know what their enemy needed. Love? Fear? Hope? Maybe they're being held hostage... No, nothing in my readings indicated that level of stress. Counselor? Counselor Troi? I'm sorry... I don't sense them well enough. Number One, you say the couple is incapable of sustaining themselves? There's a fusion reactor in the house, good for five years. But their water-table is tainted. They have nothing except a garden. They won't come to the ship? They were adamant. We'll do what we can for them. In the meantime... I'm sorry, I'm not well. I'd like to go to my quarters. By all means. Anything I can do? Captain, a search of the Ranian System has determined that the force that attacked this planet is no longer present. I remember a Starfleet admiral saying the same thing about renegade Andorians in the Triangular System. It turns out that they had dismantled their ship and hidden it. Those Andorians did not have to contend with my thoroughness. I will stake my reputation. Don't... listen. Think of something else. Stop! Please stop! Yes? I was concerned. I came to see if I could help. I'm fine, there's nothing wrong. I'm just tired, that's all. Now, I may not have your gifts at reading emotions but I can tell when someone is in pain... and hiding it. It's so silly. I hear music... ...in my mind, music that won't stop. Perhaps it's a symptom of fatigue. We've all been inflicted at one time with that melody that won't go away. No, it's deeper than that. The song doesn't stop for an instant. It plays in perfect clarity, from beginning to end, over and over again. I don't even know the song. I never heard it before. When did this start? A few hours ago, while the away team was on the surface. I was trying to... I was thinking of Rishon and Kevin. Rishon and Kevin? And? I can't explain it, Captain. They're... elusive. They're... I'm sorry. Well, try and rest. Take the necessary sleep inducements if you have to. Data, give us a visual. Magnification factor 50. Look at the size of that! Where did that come from? A Lagrange point, behind Rana IV's furthest moon. Our vehicle-classification index can put no identity to it. Its design is foreign. That's our boy. Five times our mass, carrying enough armament to pulverize a planet. Lieutenant? I... cannot explain this, Captain. It's heading for the planet. Hailing frequencies. Mr Data, ask them to identify themselves and match our orbit. They've received the message but are ignoring it. Maximum shields, ready weapons. Aye, sir. It's assuming an attack posture. Don't be surprised if... The vessel is firing streams of positrons and antiprotons. Equivalent firepower, 40 megawatts. Shields are holding. Again, 40 megawatts. No damage. If that's their best, this should last five minutes. Let's raise our voice a little. Fire phasers, a warning shot. Mr Data, invite them to stand to. The vessel has assumed a position outside the Rana system and it is rapidly increasing velocity. Helm, initiate pursuit. Aye, sir. The vessel has reached warp two and continues an acceleration curve. We're not getting any closer. Give us a superior curve. Warp three, warp four. The warship continues to match our acceleration curve point for point. Warp 4.5. Warp five. Warp 5.5. Riker to La Forge. Give us everything you can. Yes, sir! I'll get you to 9.37 in 1 5 seconds. Warp 8.75. Warp nine. It's matching our acceleration perfectly. Number One, I have the impression that we're being toyed with. Take us back to Rana IV. Back? We have unfinished business. I need to talk to those people. You have the bridge. Reduce speed. Bring us around on a return course. This one's getting away. Good afternoon! I'm sorry if I startled you. Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. I have brought you something you will need... ...if you're going to stay on Rana IV. A matter replicator. It has limited capabilities. We have no use for such a thing. It will provide you with clothing, food and water. Lt Worf will demonstrate its operation. We don't need it. Kevin, we do. Thank you, Captain. Kevin and I were about to have tea. You must join us. I'd like that. Rishon, they only want to spy on us. Kevin, I've never turned anyone away from here. I won't start now. Captain. Thank you. No! Stop! Please, I'll do anything! Please stop! Please. I'm here to help. It's so loud! It's getting louder! Please, I can't stand it! Make it stop! Move her to the bed. This will help you relax. I hear it. It's still there! It's so loud! Take her to sickbay. No, I want to stay in my quarters. I can get you to sleep. The music will follow me. I can induce delta sleep, lock out even your deepest dreams. It's not a dream. It's real. Kevin and I first met on a ship at sea. He was a starving student with this threadbare suit and mismatched shoes. I was traveling with my parents who did not like him hanging around. Two hours later, I asked him to marry me. He knew I was serious. I don't think he's ever recovered from that day. What do you think, Mr Worf? Good tea. Nice house. Why did you leave Earth and come here when you did? You mean at our age. We thought it might make us fall in love all over again. It worked. Must've been terrible when the colony was fighting for its life. It was. Fires lit the sky. There was unbelievable thunder. The ground never stopped shaking. And yet... ...you survived. We don't know why we survived and the others didn't. I've tried to put some purpose to it but I can't. I've been wondering when your ship would be leaving? I don't have an answer for that. A few hours ago, we encountered a warship, possibly the one that attacked you. We forced it to leave the system... ...but we were not able to affect it otherwise. It could return. Kevin, you said it had gone away. I guess I was wrong. Don't worry, it didn't hurt us. It won't now. Do you know that? No, but I don't enjoy seeing my wife frightened. We've told you, we don't know why we were spared. But there had to be some reason. In some way, you were different from the other colonists. Your geographical location, your philosophical beliefs. The color of your eyes. In some way, you were set apart. There was a difference. I'm a man of special conscience. While the others did what they could, I chose not to fight. That is your protected right. But the attacking ship had no way of realizing this. I expected to die like the others. There is no reason for you and your ship to remain. We can manage without you. Kevin grieved for the others, Captain, but he did nothing. He is a very gentle man. You must understand that. What about you, Rishon? Is that how you feel? I wanted to fight but I stayed with my husband. Well, Captain. Thank you again for the replicator. I'd better clean up now. Before we leave, I ask you one more time. Come to the ship. For your safety. Captain, I am frightened but... I can't leave Rana, even if it means my life. I don't understand. I've inhibited almost all activity in the neocortex. She continues as if she is hearing the music. We have to shield her from all outside stimuli by inducing coma. I have a positive identification. It is the vessel that attacked us. It is re-entering the system at high velocity, approaching Rana IV. Give us a tight visual, Data. Is it my imagination or does it look a lot meaner? Shields up. Weapons ready. Our friend is back. I'm not surprised. Mr Worf, open a hailing frequency. Warn the vessel to stay clear. Aye, sir, but they are already within firing range. Shields are down. They hit us with 400 gigawatts of particle energy! Damage? Superficial. But how to reassemble the shields? Shields down. Thermal damage to the hull. The warship is capable of far more powerful bursts. They are maneuvering between us and Rana IV. Number One, we have been exemplary in our patience. Lt Worf, fire phasers with a simultaneous spread of torpedoes. The vessel appears undamaged. Its defenses are able to absorb incoming matter and energy. Commence rapid fire. All weapons on full. Shields down. Internal damage. Weapons-systems control lost. Riker to sickbay. Medical assistance. On our way. Mr Crusher, move the Enterprise out of range of the vessel. Aye, sir. Mr Worf? The vessel has terminated its pursuit. It is assuming an orbit around Rana IV. Kevin and Rishon? We can't help them. But it's my guess they're in no danger. Can you help her? I've done everything I can. I don't understand the nature of this music or where it's from. Could it be telepathic? Yes. But I'm not the expert in determining that. They're blocking her sensitivity. They're stopping her from seeing the truth. Who's stopping her? Kevin and Rishon. What? They wanted us to leave. That's exactly what we're doing. Picard to bridge. Yes, Captain? Number One, I want you to maintain this course for another hour. Then turn the Enterprise around back to Rana IV. We still won't have our shields by then. Take it back, Number One. And this time, nothing is going to lure us away. Sir, sensors indicate no spacecraft near Rana IV, but, Captain... Forget your error. There was no way to prevent it. Captain, the house is coming into transporter range. Mr Worf, accompany me. You have the bridge, Number One. Captain, that warship has come after us twice. It could come back. I disagree. I don't think it knows we're here. I think that it believes it has run us off. However, that will all change once I'm back on board. Sir? It's protecting Kevin and Rishon. It responds to their wishes. Indirectly or directly, I'm not sure. That's what I'm going to test. Celebrating? What are you doing here? What do you want? This is your second show of surprise at my appearance. The first time was understandable but now? Unless it is because you never expected to see me again. Why do you keep interfering with our lives? It is not my intention to interfere. Only to help you and Rishon. Then, please, leave us alone. I promise. When I leave, I will never set foot here again. The Enterprise will remain in orbit. Why? To protect you. That's not necessary. I thought you understood. It is necessary. You're in grave danger. A warship has returned. Kevin! He's lying, Rishon. We fought a battle and lost. Many crew have been injured. A woman's mind is being destroyed by telepathic manipulation. No. Please, no. This is a form of intimidation. I have my rights. Your rights. What about Rishon? Is she in favor of being left here? Come to the Enterprise, where you will be safe. No. I can't leave Kevin. I'm staying. She's safe here with me... in this house. Why are you safe? Why is this house a sanctuary? Does it have to do with refusing to fight? Tell me this. If Rishon were in danger, would you kill to save her life? No, not for her. Not for anyone. I will not kill. Please stop hurting him. Captain, leave our house. It is my duty to protect you. The Enterprise will remain in orbit around Rana IV as long as the two of you are alive. Number One, an update, please. Little change. Our shields are still inoperable. We have partial control of weapons. I doubled repair crews. The warship is approaching. It is very close. 300,000km. How's that possible? That's no concern, Number One. It's here and it's precisely on schedule. The vessel has altered its course to intercept the Enterprise. Worf, arm phasers and torpedoes. Prepare to fire. Belay those orders, Mr Worf. The vessel is now within 20,000km of the Enterprise and closing. Let it come. Let it come. Activate the main viewer. Evasive action, sir? The Enterprise will hold, Mr Worf. Weapons, sir? On my orders, not before. The vessel is entering a low orbit around Rana IV. It appears to be preparing to fire, Captain. My calculations indicate that its target is the house of Kevin and Rishon. There will be no interference from us. The house has been obliterated. Scan for survivors. There are no survivors. Mr Worf. Prepare a photon torpedo. Fire at the enemy vessel when ready. Aye, sir. Number One. What reason does the Enterprise have for remaining at Rana? The unknown vessel has been destroyed. The Uxbridges have been destroyed. There is no reason for the Enterprise to remain. Good. Helm, move us into higher orbit so we may keep the surface of the planet under surveillance. Aye, sir. But, Captain, what are we watching for? Anything. Everything. I'll be in my ready room if I'm needed. That will be all for now. Come. May I speak with you, Captain? My pleasure, Number One. We have been observing this planet for three hours. Nothing. I have the feeling you're waiting for something. Your captain is acting on an assumption, Will. And I'm not sure what the result will be or... even that my assumption is correct. We found two people alive in a house on a devastated planet. But... ...there was only one survivor of the war on Rana IV. Why is it we maintain watch on a planet that is dead? Bridge to Picard. You'd better come see this. Captain. Commander. The house is back. Trees, grass, everything. Happened right in front of us. Mr Worf, any survivors? I detect two life forms inside the house. It appears Kevin and Rishon were not destroyed. Helm, take us within transporter range. We'll beam them up here. But will they not protest? Let them. Apologies if I interrupted a waltz. Why have you brought us here against our will? I want to end the suffering of my crew member. I don't understand. Kevin does. He's the cause. At first I couldn't understand why your house survived the holocaust. Then it occurred to me. It had been destroyed. That dwelling, where you served tea, where you danced waltzes... ...is a reproduction. Real to the touch, but capable of being created, destroyed and created. All on a whim. You're joking with us. Can't you see this hurts him? Rishon. Hear what he has to say. More than anything, you wanted the Enterprise away from Rana because the house, the plot of land, your very existence, were incongruities that you were not prepared to explain. The warship, another recreation, tried to chase us away twice. And failed. But when I came the second time, I provided you with the only condition that would make the Enterprise leave. Your deaths. You did your best to satisfy that condition. I'm deeply sorry about the woman. I will help her. But I must know what you intend to do with me. You will be taken to a starbase for the attack on the Enterprise and, possibly, the deaths of 1 1,000 people. No! He never killed anyone. The destruction happened just as I told you. But you haven't told us the whole story. How it ended. The part about... Rishon. What is he saying? Rishon... I can... touch you. I can hear your voice, smell your perfume. In every respect, you are a real person with your own mind... ...and beliefs, but... ...you do not exist. You died along with the others defending the colony. He recreated you, just as he recreated the house. You are the only living thing that really exists on Rana. And though you look human, you're not. He's in the turbolift. Let him go. He is dangerous! So dangerous he could have destroyed us had he wished. Track him. Alert the crew to keep clear. I want him to understand we mean no harm. Will he return to the planet? He is a creature of conscience. He has someone to help first. I've taken the music from her mind. She's alright now. She's sleeping. She was beginning to sense who I really was. I've lived as a human for 50 years but I couldn't hide from her. She's suffered because of my pride and selfishness. It will not happen again. What happened on Rana IV? The truth. This time, all of it. Very well. For what it's worth. I am a Douwd. An immortal being of disguises and false surroundings. I have lived in this galaxy for thousands of years, although until today, no one has known my true identity. Once, while traveling in human form, I chanced to fall in love with an Earth woman. I put aside my powers and became her husband. Our life was happy and rich. Eventually, we came to this planet to live our final years. Now she is dead. She never knew what I really was. Your colony was attacked by a warship. Belonging to the Husnock, a species of hideous intelligence... ...who knew only aggression and destruction. I could've destroyed them with a mere thought but I did not do so. You had the power to stop them but you didn't? I refused to for the reason that I refused to stop the Enterprise. I... will not kill. So you let the colonists fight a hopeless battle? I tried to fool the Husnock... ...as I tried to fool you. It only made them angrier. More cruel. And then what you most feared happened. Rishon went to fight with the colonists. And died with them. How I wish... I could have died with her. But you couldn't. You were left alone. Yes. I saw her broken body. I went insane. My hatred exploded. And in an instant of grief... ...I destroyed the Husnock. Why did you try to hide this from all of us? Was it guilt for not helping Rishon and the others? No, no, no. You don't understand the scope of my crime. I didn't kill just one Husnock, or a hundred or a thousand... I killed them all. All Husnock. Everywhere. Are 1 1,000 people worth... ...50 billion? Is the love of a woman worth the destruction of an entire species? This is the sin I tried to keep you from learning. Why I wanted to chase you from Rana. We're not qualified to be your judges. We have no law to fit your crime. You're free to return to the planet... ...and to make Rishon live again. Helm, break orbit. Full impulse. Captain's log, stardate 43153.7. We are departing the Rana System for Starbase 133. We leave a being of extraordinary power and conscience. I'm not certain if he should be praised or condemned. Only that he should be left alone. "
S3E04,"Captain's log, stardate 43173.5. We are en route to Mintaka III, where a Federation anthropological team has been studying the inhabitants. Our mission is to resupply the outpost and repair their malfunctioning reactor. Mr La Forge, report. We replicated the parts. But why does a three-man station need a 4.2 gigawatt reactor? Enough to power a small phaser bank, a relay station, or...? Or a hologram generator. A duck blind! Right, they're anthropologists. Who are studying an extended family of Mintakans at close range, from a camouflaged observation post. Dr Barron's preliminary reports say the Mintakans are proto-Vulcan humanoids at the Bronze-Age level. Peaceful and highly rational. Not surprising. Their evolution parallels Vulcan. Captain, transmission from Mintaka III. Thank you, Lieutenant. On screen. Barron to Enterprise. Our repairs have failed. The reactor is inoperative. Do you have battery back-up? Three hours at best. If we increase to warp seven, we can be there in 23 minutes. Make it so. We're on our way... We've lost contact, sir. Increase to warp nine. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. The framework's still charged, so watch it. Why did we have to come so early? When the sun reaches its zenith, I must take the measurements. You've read the sundial hundreds of times. Yes, Father, but never as the appointed record keeper. You're taking your duties quite seriously. Your mother would have been very proud. What is that? Up there, Father! What is it? I don't know. Keep work... Palmer...? It's alright. The holographic generator is functioning. All we need now is power. Almost there. You wait here, Oji. Enterprise, beam Martinez and his patient directly to sickbay. Commander? Doctor, be careful. I've got to get down there. Crusher to Enterprise. Medical emergency. Two to beam directly to sickbay. Aye, Doctor. That should do it. You increased the levels of tricordrazine? Dr Crusher? Before you quote the Prime Directive, he'd already seen us. It was either bring him aboard or let him die. Then why didn't you let him die? Because we were responsible for his injuries! I'm not sure that I concur with that reasoning, Doctor. But now that he's here, you must remove all memory of his encounter with the away team. By erasing short-term recall? It has been accomplished before. I am familiar with Dr Pulaski's technique. But will it be effective on Mintakans? Their lie-zone levels are lower. Wait! No, no! We must evacuate! Dr Barron, you're on the Enterprise. You're safe. And the others? Dr Warren is here. We're doing all we can. And where is Palmer? Still on Mintaka. You have to find him! We will. He may be hurt. Rest assured, we shall not leave until he is located. Thank you, Picard. Picard to bridge. Report. Scans on the planet detect no humans, Captain. Very well. Put us in a close orbit. A close orbit will increase sensor efficiency by only four percent. I want that four percent. Aye, sir. Picard out. Picard...? Damn! Well, Doctor, your next task is clear. Oji? Father? Here! I thought I'd never see you again. When you and the woman vanished, I was sure you were dead. I think I was. But I was brought back to life. I awoke in an incredible place, and my wounds were gone. I had been healed. How is that possible? Long ago, our people believed in beings with great powers. Those beings made the rains come, they told the sun when to rise, they caused all life to be born, to grow, to die. But those are just tales. Old superstitions. But perhaps the beliefs of our ancestors are true. Nothing else can explain what's happened. Everything is changed now, Oji. We must tell the others. Barron is stable, but Warren is critical. Palmer is missing. A scan shows no human life forms. However... The area around the duck blind has karst topography. Sinkholes, underground rivers and caverns. The rock strata has thallium compound that may obstruct our sensor beams. If Palmer, delirious, is in a cave, we wouldn't detect his life signs? Correct, sir. If he is still alive, we must send an away team to locate him. But we must not interfere with the development of the Mintakans. Agreed. Further contamination must be prevented. I have a suggestion. First Officer's log, stardate 43174.2. Troi and I are beaming down to locate Dr Palmer, and to determine the extent of the cultural contamination. Dr Crusher has temporarily altered our features and color. She has implanted subcutaneous communicators so that any transmissions will be inaudible to the Mintakans. Enterprise, do you hear me? Perfectly, Commander. I will monitor you continuously. Mintakan emotions are interesting. Like Vulcans, they have highly-ordered minds. A very sensible people. For example, Mintakan women precede their mates. It's a signal to other women. He's taken, get your own? Not precisely. More like, ""If you want his services, I'm the one you negotiate with."" What kind of services? All kinds. They are a sensible race. I understand your scepticism. If it hadn't happened to me, I would find it hard to accept. But it did happen. Fento, do the legends not speak of beings like the kind I've seen? Who could vanish like smoke? There are stories of the Overseer, who could appear and disappear at will. And couldn't this Overseer heal the dead? He had supreme power, or so our ancestors believed. I believe I have seen the Overseer. He is called the Picard. Oh-oh! His memory's intact. The procedure didn't work. Liko, all this talk of supernatural beings. No one has believed that for generations. Just as we no longer believe that the stars control our fates or the spirits of the dead haunt the living. Nuria, I'm not saying that all the old beliefs are true. But I did see the Picard. And I was restored back to life. We are visitors. We've come to trade our cloth. May we speak? Please do. We welcome outsiders. I am Nuria. I am Troi, this is Riker. You had a very interesting dream. Dream? It was real! My father and I both witnessed these beings. If you are father and daughter, you may well have shared the same dream. That is not reasonable. Any less reasonable than being magically transformed by the Picard? Nuria! It has to be Palmer! The one the Picard wished to find. You were speaking the truth! The Picard will be pleased. Riker to Picard. Go ahead. We have a problem. With the contamination? It's worse than we thought. The Mintakans are beginning to believe in a god. And the one they've chosen is you. Beam Palmer aboard. Without medical attention... He is surrounded by Mintakans. If he should dematerialize... It will slightly increase the contamination which already exists. A small price for saving Palmer's life. Number One? Is there any chance of transporting Palmer unseen? We can try. Try hard. Picard out. I must protest. You endanger Palmer with this delay. I am aware of that. But each of us, including Dr Palmer, took an oath that we would uphold the Prime Directive, if necessary, with our lives. We were hunting. We followed a hornbuck into a cave. The stranger was there, asleep. Is he one of the Overseer's servants? Yes. The Picard has many servants. Isn't that true, Fento? According to legend. But if he is the servant of the Overseer, why was he in a cave? Perhaps he ran away. Or he failed the Picard and was hiding. Bind him in case he wakes and tries to escape. It's senseless to hold this stranger captive. This talk of the Overseer, it's old superstitions. I disagree. All the evidence indicates he exists. And I heard the Picard say he wanted to find Palmer. By keeping Palmer safe, we will please the Picard. He will grant us favors in return. Favors? It is said that the Overseer is all-powerful. He can provide gentle winters, plentiful hunting, fertile crops, anything. He can even... bring back those who have died. It's agreed. We will save Palmer for the Picard. Yes, yes. I've seen another one, like Palmer. Another servant of the Picard? He's headed toward the caves. Fento, stay and bind Palmer. Where? Over there. That knot won't hold. If I may? Please do. You need a knot that will tighten under pressure. Let me show you. The sun's reaching its zenith. If I don't measure it... Go. Forgive me, friend, but the stranger must be set free. Prepare to beam us to sickbay, but hang on for my signal. Acknowledged, Commander. Riker, stop! It's Riker! He's taking Palmer! Hali! Yuri, don't let her escape! I'm clear. Energize. Data, has Counselor Troi beamed up? Negative. Sensors show she is in the midst of a group of Mintakans. Damn! He is alright. Hali, find Riker and Palmer. Why did you and Riker take Palmer? We did not take Palmer. We set him free. Riker and I do not believe in these fables about an Overseer. You've angered the Picard and we may all suffer for it! I know. I've seen him. He is all-powerful. Weren't there stories about the Overseer destroying those who offended him? Stories, nothing more. Liko, we'll get Palmer back. Riker was carrying him. They can't have gone far. Still, the Picard may blame us for letting Palmer escape. Perhaps we should punish her, let the Overseer know that she and Riker acted alone. We will keep Troi captive. That's not enough. You would have us harm her? If it will hold off the Picard's anger, yes. I've seen how powerful he is. I am unwilling to hurt her needlessly. We will wait for Hali to return. And if they don't find Palmer? Then we may do as Liko suggests. Doctor, you believe they are capable of harming Troi? They are not normally violent, but these are extraordinary circumstances. They're trying to comprehend a god. Recommendations? The Mintakans can only guess what the Overseer wants. They need a sign. Are you suggesting...? You must go down there. Masquerading as a god? Out of the question. The Prime Directive... Has been violated. The damage is done. All we can do now is minimize it. Sanction false beliefs? Give them guidelines. Let them know what the Overseer expects. I cannot, I will not, impose a set of commandments on these people. To do so violates the essence of the Prime Directive! We have rekindled their belief in the Overseer. Are you saying that this belief will become a religion? It's inevitable. And without guidance, that religion could degenerate into inquisitions, holy wars, chaos. Horrifying. Dr Barron. Your report describes how rational these people are. Millennia ago, they abandoned their belief in the supernatural. You are asking me to sabotage that achievement, to send them back to the Dark Ages of superstition and ignorance and fear? No! We will find some way to undo the damage we've caused. Number One, tell me about this group's leader. Nuria. Clear-minded, sensible. The Mintakans trust her judgement. If we can convince her that you are not a god... She may persuade the others. And how do you propose to convince her? She believes the Picard is a magical figure. I'm going to show her how the magic works. I'm going to bring her aboard. Sensors indicate five Mintakans in your immediate vicinity. Four are motionless, the fifth is proceeding south. Is Nuria one of these five? Was that intended as affirmative? Yes, Data. Is Nuria the closest? Negative. Is Nuria the one in motion? Lock sensors on Nuria. Locked on. We can beam Nuria aboard at will. When sensors indicate that she's alone, beam her up. Aye, sir. Ensign Hoy? Nuria is alone. I'll handle this. Nuria. Don't be afraid. No one is going to harm you. Who...? I am Jean-Luc... Picard. Please, get up. Get up. You must not kneel to me. You do not wish it? I do not deserve it. Look at me. Feel... the warmth of my hand. The rhythm of my pulse. I'm not a supreme being. I'm flesh and blood, like you. Not like me. Like you. Different in appearance. But we are both living beings. We are born, we grow, we live. And we die. In all the ways that matter, we are alike. But you are the Picard! There's something I want you to see. What a wondrous place! Even the walls obey your command. Wondrous, yes, but not miraculous. The doors merely work differently from the ones you know. That is my home? Seen from far, far above. Yet we do not fall. I never imagined I would see the clouds from the other side. Your powers are truly boundless. Your people live in huts. Was it always so? No. We have found remnants of tools in caves. Our ancestors lived there. Why do you now live in huts? Huts are better. Caves are dark and wet. If huts are better, why did you live in caves? The most reasonable explanation would be that at one time, we did not know how to make huts. Just as at one time, you did not know how to weave cloth, how to make a bow. That would be reasonable. Someone invented a hut. Someone invented a bow, who taught others, who taught their children, who built a stronger hut, built a better bow, who taught their children. Now, Nuria, suppose one of your cave-dwelling ancestors were to see you as you are today. What would she think? I don't know. Put yourself in her place. You see, she cannot kill a hornbuck at a great distance. You can. You have a power she lacks. Only because I have a bow. She has never seen a bow. It doesn't exist in her world. To you, it's a simple tool. To her... it's magic. I suppose she might think so. Now, how would she react to you? I think she would fear me. Just as you fear me. I do not fear you any longer. Good. That's good. You see... ...my people once lived in caves. And we then learned to build huts and, in time, to build ships, like this one. Perhaps one day, my people will travel above the skies. Of that, I have absolutely no doubt. It's not the season for lightning. It must be a warning. We've had storms like this before. Not like this one. It must mean something. The Picard is angry. He blames us for letting Palmer escape. We don't know that the Overseer is responsible for this storm. Will he send floods? My wife died in last year's floods. Will we all die now? We must find Nuria. Picard, you have shown me wonders I could never have imagined. I am grateful to you beyond words. Might I request something for my people? You are indeed a leader. You've shown me such generosity. I wish my people could share in it. Six Mintakans died in a flood last winter, four of them children. Would you bring them back to life? That is not in my power. Why? You restored Liko's life. Did the six who were killed offend you in some way? Did I offend you? Should I have ordered the death of Troi? Please! You must tell me if there's anything I can do to change your mind. I've failed to get through to you, despite all my efforts. Nuria can't be found. No one knows where she is. Hali, any sign of Palmer or Riker? They have escaped us. We searched everywhere. What do we do now, Father? We must do as the Picard wishes. Punish those responsible. Nuria would not allow us. Nuria isn't here! We can't wait. Crusher to Picard. I think we're going to lose Warren. On my way. I'm here, Mary. Prepare 2cc of norep. I'm sorry. Picard, you could not save her? No. You do have limits. You are not masters of life and death. No, we're not. We can cure many diseases, we can repair injuries, we can even extend life. But for all our knowledge, all our advances... ...we're just as mortal as you are. We're just as powerless to prevent the inevitable. You are a remarkable people. But you are not superior beings. My people must be made to understand that. Liko, you don't want to kill me. I have no choice. I must do as the Picard wishes. Are you sure you know what he wants? That's the problem with believing in a supernatural being. Trying to determine what he wants. We must do something. But what if it's the wrong thing, Father? Picard, we need your guidance. Is it your wish that this woman should die? Answer us. Speak. Liko! The Picard. The Overseer has come. No. Liko. Liko, I am a man. I am not the Overseer. I am a traveler from a faraway land. Nothing more. But you restored my life. I am your servant. You are nobody's servant. I neither desire your obedience nor your worship. Picard speaks the truth. I have visited his people. I have seen how they live and die. When death takes their loved ones, they are as helpless as we are. Then how was I brought back to life? Liko, you were not dead. Picard's people have a knowledge that we lack. They can heal wounds that we cannot. No! He can bring back the dead. Show them, Picard. You can bring back my wife to me. I cannot. Why? Why won't you do this for me? Have I failed you in some way? Are you angry with me? No, I'm not. Then I beg you, bring her back to me! I will give you my life in exchange. Please! Take back what you gave me. Give it to her. Let her live. It is beyond my power. Nothing is beyond your power! You are the Overseer. I will prove it! Liko! If you believe I am all-powerful, then you cannot hurt me. lf, however, I am telling the truth... ...and I am mortal, you will kill me. But if the only proof you will believe is my death... ...then shoot. Liko, don't do it! Father, no! Captain's log, supplemental. Dr Crusher has repaired my injury with her usual skill. Mr La Forge will supervise the dismantling of the observation post, after I make one last visit to Mintaka III. Now, Mr La Forge. Aye, sir. What is that? It is a place where we can watch your people. But why? To study you. To understand your ways. Continue, Mr La Forge. Why would a people so advanced want to learn about us? We were once as you are now. To study you is to understand ourselves. But why did you have to hide from us? Because their presence would affect us, just as it affected me. It is our highest law not to interfere with other cultures. Revealing yourself was an accident? Yes. And now we must leave you. Why? There's so much you can teach us. That, too, would be interference. You must progress in your own way. So we will. You have taught us there is nothing beyond our reach. Not even the stars. Pahkee? I wish you good journeys, Picard. Remember my people. Always. "
S3E05,"Commander, away team reporting in. Lt Worf standing by. This is Riker. Go ahead, Lieutenant. The archaeologists have identified these markings. This planet was once home to a race known as the Koinonians. What do we know, Data? The Koinonians were a culture which became embroiled in a war that lasted generations. Our evidence indicates they destroyed themselves. We have completed our survey and will proceed to the chamber. Affirmative. Enterprise out. Destroyed themselves, Data? According to records, this will be the first opportunity... Captain... Beam them up quickly! Captain. Emergency beam-up. Enterprise. Severe injuries. Transporter room. Beam them straight to sickbay! Dr Crusher, incoming wounded! Away team is on board, Captain. One dead on arrival. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 43198.7. The Enterprise remains in orbit while we investigate the tragedy which has struck the away team. Lt Marla Aster, ship's archaeologist, has been killed on a routine mission. Whatever the explanation, it will not bring back a valued officer. Lieutenant? We had completed our investigation of the third tunnel. Our scans indicated no weapons or traps of any kind. Lt Aster was three meters behind me. An explosive device went off. There was no warning. Lt Aster bore the full brunt of the detonation. Lt Aster is survived by a son, Jeremy. 12 years old. He's aboard the Enterprise, sir. And his father? He's also deceased. His only living relatives are an aunt and uncle on Earth. Where is he now? In class. The teacher expects us. Captain. I must accompany you. I commanded the away team. I appreciate your offer, Lieutenant. This is my responsibility. Picard to bridge. La Forge will lead another away team. I want to know what happened. Yes, Captain. I will be with Counselor Troi and young Jeremy Aster. I understand. Riker out. He had to do this for me. Do you know Jeremy well? But I know what this will be like for him. That's part of life in Starfleet. I know. They prepare us for anything, but still... I know. How do you get used to it? Telling them. You hope you never do. I sense the weight of this duty on you, Captain. I really wonder... Halt. I've always believed that carrying children on a starship... ...is a very questionable policy. Serving on a starship means accepting certain risks... ...certain dangers. Did Jeremy Aster make that choice? Death and loss are an integral part of life everywhere. Leaving him on Earth would not protect him. But the Earth won't be ordered to the Neutral Zone. My command sent his mother to her death. She understood her mission and my duty. Will he? In time... and with help. Wesley Crusher does. He does. And so will Jeremy. Resume. Jeremy, I have some bad news. There has been an accident. Your mother... has died. How, sir? An explosive device at the mission site. She died instantly. I understand. Jeremy, I know your mother loved you very much. I am told... that your father is also dead. Yes, sir. He died five years ago from a Rushton infection. I'm all alone now, sir. Jeremy, on the Starship Enterprise, no one is alone. No one. Excuse me, sir. Am I intruding? No, sit down. How well did you know Lt Aster? We spent some time together. Not very well. How well did you know her? Why do you ask? Well, you asked me. But why ask the question? Since her death, I have been asked several times how well I knew Lt Aster. And I heard you ask Wesley how well he knew Jeremy. Does the question of familiarity have some bearing on death? Do you remember when Tasha died? I do not sense the same feelings of absence as with Lt Yar. Although I cannot say precisely why. Just human nature. Human nature, sir? We feel a loss more intensely when it's a friend. But should not the feelings run as deep, regardless of who has died? Maybe they should. Maybe if we felt any loss as keenly as for one close to us, human history would be less bloody. La Forge to Riker. You're back. Yes, sir. We've brought back a souvenir. There are five more, all identical to the one that killed Lt Aster. They employ a subspace proximity detonator. A tricorder would never detect it. How long would they have been there? It comes from the time of the Koinonian Wars, sir. Did you find them all, Geordi? Yeah, but... Well, it seemed like they were left to be found. Left by whom? There are no indications of life. I don't know, Captain. But they were recently pulled out of the ground and defused. I have made my report. I'm more interested in how you feel about what happened. I sense great anger. I cannot seek revenge against an enemy who's turned to dust centuries ago. Her death was senseless! The last victim of a forgotten war! Go on. There's nothing more to be said. A person died under your command. It may happen again. If you can't learn to release the anger and guilt, to talk... A leader must stand alone. As Capt Picard does. Capt Picard talks to me. Then... may I seek counsel on my plan to make R'uustai with the boy? The Bonding? It is my right. It's very generous, Worf, but... he's not a Klingon child. He has different sensibilities. He is an orphan. I am an orphan. He will understand. Right now there isn't much he can understand. He is holding all his feelings inside. Children often feel they must be true to the memory of a lost parent. If you offer affection too soon, they can feel guilty returning that affection, as if they're betraying the love of the parent. I only wish to honor his mother. I know and I understand this means a great deal to you. But you must be prepared. He's very angry, too, but his anger is deep inside him. When he touches it, it will strike out in many directions, including yours. Be with him. Talk to him, but don't rush this. When he's ready, we'll know. Capt Patches, an alien ship! What shall we do? Oh, no! We've been hit! We're going down. That was great! Get a shot of Mom. What are you doing? I'll turn your lens to shards! Go away! Go away! Over there! Patches! Capt Patches is landing on the sofa! Oh, no! He's gonna crash! Jeremy Aster? I'm Lt Worf. May I enter? You were in command. Yes. I was with Lt Aster... ...your mother, when she died. You're a Klingon, aren't you? Yes. We studied about Klingons in school. What did they teach you? You used to be our enemies. Did they teach you that we hope to die in the line of duty? In my tradition, we do not grieve the loss of the body. We celebrate the releasing of the spirit. I understand death. They teach us all about it. Jeremy Aster, we both understand. But we must bring meaning into your mother's death. Perhaps we can do it together. Come. Counselor, how's the boy? He's being very brave. Good. No, he has to get past brave. He's very angry and he has to express that anger before he can say goodbye to his mother. How can we help? Well, I've asked Beverly to get Wesley to talk to Jeremy about his father's death. The one unusual element is Worf. In many ways, he is suffering as badly as the boy. He wishes to involve Jeremy in a Klingon ceremony called R'uustai, the Bonding. I know of that. Perhaps it would help them. I don't think Jeremy's ready for Worf now. Perhaps later. It will have to be handled delicately. As you always do. I break the unpleasant news and there my responsibility ends. But you... You have to stay with them through the grieving process. We deal with our pain in many different ways. Over the years, I've discovered it's in joy that the uniqueness of each individual is revealed. If I can help a person back to joy... ...well, my role has its rewards. Captain, we're picking up energy on the planet's surface. Location? Two kilometers north of the away team's beam-down point. Full scan. Inconclusive, Captain. Sir, I'm sensing a presence on the planet. Very vague. Life form? I can't be sure. The emotions of the crew are so strong now, it's difficult to filter them out. Data, scan analysis on main viewer. Hi. Hi. Troi stopped by. She was wondering if you'd talk to Jeremy Aster. Me? What for? About your dad. What will I tell him? It would help to talk to someone who's been through this. We had each other. He doesn't have anyone right now. He might be more comfortable with someone who's not so much older. OK, I'll think about it. OK. Do you think about him, Mom? Your father? Sure I do. Sometimes... ...I can't even remember what his face looks like. It scares me. It happens to all of us, Wes. Sometimes... ...I can't get his face out of my mind. Today... Today it's like I can see it all as if it were yesterday. I can remember the way Dad looked when he hugged me goodbye, Capt Picard's eyes when he came to tell us... Data, run comparison of known phenomena. The pattern has no match in Federation records. Is it alive? A possibility. Captain. I'm getting an unusual magnetic-flux reading from the pods. My God... Wait a minute. You've got ten seconds more, Mom. No peeking. Come on, Patches, in here. OK, Mom, we're ready! Jeremy? I'm getting closer! Jeremy? I'm gonna find you! You must be in here somewhere. Mom?! All systems are functioning normally. Still, there's this fluctuation in the containment field. Can't account for it. Is this related to the planet? There is a beam of particles emanating from it. But I cannot pinpoint the location. Captain, there's a presence on the Enterprise. An alien presence? No intruder on the sensors. There is a presence. Security, all decks yellow alert. Possible intruder. They said you were dead. There was a mistake. It's OK. But there was an explosion. You were hurt. I'm fine. You mustn't think any more about this. The important thing is I'll never leave you again. I think somebody needs a hug. We have to go now. Where? To the planet. That's where we're going to live. Not on the Enterprise? No. We're gonna live in a home, just like on Earth. You'll see. I promise. Lt Worf! It was a mistake. She didn't die. She's alive! Jeremy, come here! Lt Worf. It's alright. I'm here for the boy. Lt Worf to Capt Picard. Go ahead. Lt Aster is in her quarters. Repeat, Worf. Lt Aster is here. In her quarters with the boy. Do not provoke her or interfere in any way. Picard out. Number One, have Security move in that way but tell them to keep their distance. You have the bridge. Counselor. Don't worry. I'm going to take care of Jeremy, make him happy. It's time to go. Where are you taking the child? To the planet. Come, Jeremy. Worf to Picard. They're leaving their quarters. Captain, we're headed for transporter room three. We're on our way. Chief O'Brien, Jeremy and I are going to the surface. Who are you? I'm Marla Aster. It's my mother. She's alive. What do you want? To take my child to the planet. I cannot permit that. I'm here to care for him. He needs me. Why do you resist? Because I don't know who or what you are. Can't you see, Captain? She appears to be your mother but she is not. What? You're confusing him. Hey! Wait! Stop! No! No! Stop! Mom! Mom? Wait a minute. Let go of me. She was right there. What did you do to her? That was not your mother. You saw her. She was here. Your mother's dead. But I touched her. She was real. Why would your real mother take you to a planet of dust and rocks? It's my house. It's my house on Earth. Exactly the way it was. Remember, Jeremy? How did you do it? Does it matter? Yes, it matters. I am trying to understand your resistance. You spoke of rocks and dust on the planet. I decided to show you what awaits us. Why would you create this fantasy? It's his home. It makes you happy, doesn't it? But it's not real. Isn't it? Jeremy, isn't that really Patches? He knows me. It's him. It's real. It's all real. No, it's not. Could your real mother just make this appear? You must not stay here. Come with me. I can't. Is the boy in danger? I don't think so. She seems to want to help him. By easing his pain. She's very confused by our resistance, Captain. Troi, would it be wise to remove Jeremy from his cabin? He doesn't want to leave. I would not recommend using force. She offers him everything. All we offer is his mother's death. What would you choose? If somebody offered to give you back your mother, father, husband, would any of us say no so easily? Counselor, stay with them in Jeremy's quarters. We'll try to end this from here. Understood. Data, can you determine that the energy source is powering this creation? The beam from the planet is tapping into us. I'd say they're running her off our energy. So there are limits to her power. She needs the transporter to get him back. How do we cut the puppet's strings? Match the shield's harmonics to our containment fields. That should sever the beam. Proceed. Deanna, stand by. Standing by. Jeremy, it's time for this to end. It's not real, and it's over now. Jeremy, I'm not going to leave you ever again. I won't trick you or lie. We'll be happy together... No... Antimatter pods reading nominal. The shield has severed the beam, sir. Captain. The energy field... Mr Crusher, take us out. Alien intruder, transporter room three! Security alert! Security to transporter room three! Cmdr La Forge, Mr Worf, with me. Number One, you have the bridge. Come, Jeremy. We will not let them separate us again. We're going home. Captain, she's trying to take Jeremy off the ship. Acknowledged. Engineering, La Forge. Shut down power to transporters. I'm on my way. Aye-aye, sir. Lt Worf, to transporter room three. Bridge, seal off deck eight, corridors A and B. Engaging force fields, Captain. Transporters down. Energy force has left transporter room three. Security alert! La Forge, it may try to reinstate transporters. Understood. Bridge, release security force field 8B. Hello, Jeremy. How are you? Are you frightened? No. Well, a little, sir. Of course. These are frightening things that are happening. But we won't let anyone harm you. Counselor, take the boy to my quarters. No! It's looking over everything, Commander, going to school. Let's hope it doesn't blow us up while figuring out how to blow us up. Power's back in transporter room three. Bypassing the manual override, shutting it down. Transporter is down again. Keep it down. Understood, Commander. It is only a matter of time before we can power the transporters. We? For whom else do you speak? The accident on the surface was caused by a remnant of an ancient and tragic era. Two species once shared this world. One of energy and one of matter. The physical beings you call Koinonians destroyed themselves in unending, bitter wars. The surviving life forms will not tolerate any further suffering as a result of that dishonorable past. So... they have made this possible. They have made me possible. I appreciate your motives. But... his mother is dead. He must live with that. I will be every bit his mother! But not his mother! Picard to Lt Worf. Go ahead, Captain. Will you escort Ensign Crusher to the Aster quarters? Yes, sir. Picard out. Your philosophy is curious, Captain. What is so noble about sorrow? I can provide him an existence where he will feel no anguish. It is at the heart of our nature to feel pain... and joy. It is an essential part of what makes us what we are. He is alone now in your world. A child! Alone. How can you know he won't be happier with me? For a brief moment in time, he surely would be. Any of us in his place would be. What would Jeremy do for friends? He will have friends. And will you provide for his education, his health, his growth, a career, a wife? Yes, it's quite an undertaking you're proposing, isn't it? It is our duty to make him happy. Do you honestly believe he would be happy in... ...this total fiction which you wish to create? What reason would he have to live? What you offer him is a memory, something to cherish, not to live in. It is part of our life cycle that we accept the death of those we love. Jeremy must come to terms with his grief, not cover it. You see, we are mortal. Our time in this universe is finite. That is one of the truths that all humans must learn. Acting Ensign Crusher, reporting as ordered. Come in, Wesley. Please stay, Lieutenant. Wesley's father died on a Starfleet mission... ...when he was younger than you are. Wes, your mother told me you were finding it difficult to talk to Jeremy. Why is that? I don't know. I don't want to think about it. All this has reminded me so much of that day. The day I told you your father had been killed. As I recall, you took it very well. My parents had told me about Starfleet missions. I knew what could happen. You were prepared? No. I wasn't prepared at all. How can anyone be prepared to hear that a parent is never coming home? I tried to be what everyone expected of me. Brave and mature. Wesley, are you saying that you didn't want anybody to see what you were feeling? What were you feeling? Like... somebody had kicked me in the head. Somebody? Go on. You've wanted to tell him for a long time. I was angry... at you! Why were you angry at me, Wesley? Were you angry because I told you your father was dead? No. Then why? Because you led the mission. You came home and my father didn't. How long were you angry, Wes? For a long time. But not any more, sir. Not even a little. So, Jeremy, you must be very angry at Lieutenant Worf. He was in charge of your mother's mission just like Capt Picard, when Wesley's father was killed. Isn't that right? Worf came back. Your mother didn't. Why? Why weren't you the one who died? Why did it have to be her? He can't answer that. None of us can. Lt Worf also lost his parents. They were killed when I was six. When I was alone, humans helped me. Let me help you. The Marla Aster I knew and honored is not in this room. Nor does she await you on the planet. She now only lives here... ...and here. Join me in the R'uustai, the Bonding. You will become part of my family for all time. We will be brothers. What does that mean? It honors the memory of our mothers. We have bonded and our families are stronger. "
S3E06,"Another Coco-no-no? No, thanks, I think I've had enough. Yeah. Me too. I almost forgot. I'm sorry. I think I'd better go back. Too chilly? I can turn down the breeze. It's been a lovely program. Yeah. You're a terrific guy. Yeah. I just don't feel that way about you. Yeah. Knock it off. This was the final battle, wasn't it? Neither side expected Orelious IX to be the decisive conflict. There's not much left. The destruction is remarkable, considering the primitive period. I beg your pardon? Geordi had a big date with Christi tonight. He spent days working up the perfect program. Looks like it ended early. Cmdr Data to the bridge. Acknowledged. We're picking up a signal, coordinates 21 1 mark 61. It would seem to be an ancient interplanetary code. Mr Data? Confirmed, sir. Survivors on Orelious IX, after all this time? Not possible. Well, hardly possible, Number One. Lay in a course for the source. Approaching source, Captain. Put it on the viewer. A Promellian battle cruiser? With its Lang-cycle fusion engines intact. Sensors indicate no life signs aboard, Captain. I should hope not. That ship belongs in a museum. I'm afraid we're a little late. That call for help was probably initiated... ...over a thousand years ago. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 43205.6. We have arrived at Orelious IX to chart the battle in which the Menthars and Promellians fought to extinction. Among the ruins, we found a Promellian battle cruiser that has withstood the centuries. Indulge me. I would prefer it if I could run a security sweep. No. Captain's prerogative. This one's mine. We have examined every conceivable risk. The risks on a ship this old and fragile are inconceivable. Ghosts, perhaps? Number One, have you never dreamed... of climbing inside the bottle? Sir? The ship in the bottle. Model airships. I used to build them as a child. I bet I had a Promellian battle cruiser. Ready to beam down? Locked on, Captain. Certain about the atmosphere? There is adequate oxygen for life support. It is exactly as they left it. In the bottle. The ship... Good Lord, didn't anybody build ships in bottles as boys? I did not play with toys. I was never a boy. I did, sir. Thank you, Mr O'Brien. Proceed. I did. I really did. Ships in bottles. Great fun. What's that? The power bus may need adjusting. Keep me posted. Extraordinary! Admirable. They died at their posts. You'd expect the bridge layout of this era to be clumsy, awkward. But look at this. It's a model of simplicity. Elegant. Functional. They built this craft for generations, and it worked. Don't you have anything stronger, Guinan? Yes. Would it help? No. Tell me something. You're a woman, right? Yes, I'm a woman. What do you want in a man? Personally? As a woman, what's the first thing you look at? His head. His mind. Of course. No, his head. I'm attracted to bald men. Seriously? Seriously. Why? Maybe because a bald man was kind to me once when I was hurting, took care of me. I'd like to do that. I take care of myself now. I mean, take care of somebody. I just don't get it. I can fieldstrip a fusion reactor. I can realign power-transfer tunnels. Why can't I make anything work with Christi? It's like... I don't know what to say. You're doing fine with me. You're different. No, you're different. But I'm not trying now. That's my point. What is it? The main power returner is acting weird. Define weird. I'm getting fluctuating waveguide readings. Run a maintenance sweep. Right. Activating power pack, Captain. Mr Worf, get tricorder images of their tactical display. Aye, sir. The source of the distress signal is coming from up there. Let's end their last cry for help. Captain. I believe this is an information storage device. A crude analogue of our isolinear optical chip. Crude by our standards today, Data. But when this ship was built, humans were perfecting the mechanical clock. Still using steel crossbows in battle. Any way to see what's on this? Questionable. I believe I can supply power to its playback unit. Its components are quite old. I will amplify the image with my tricorder. I am Galek Sar, Captain of the Promellian cruiser, Cleponji. I wish anyone who finds this to know... my crew has behaved courageously. I want it recorded for all time that I alone am responsible for the fate that befell us. I have failed as a captain... ...and as the man responsible for all the souls aboard my ship. Picard to Enterprise. Go ahead, Captain. I think we have seen all there is here. At Mr O'Brien's leisure, we're ready to return. Aye, sir. Thrilling. That was... absolutely thrilling. And I was right. There were ghosts on board. One spoke to us. A friendly one, I hope? My own counterpart. The captain's final message, praising his crew. I hope you'll be as thoughtful. Mr Data, revise the annexe. This should be catalogued and then retrieved. I'm sorry, it's just a rare pleasure to see this side of your personality. Mr Crusher, set course for the original coordinates. Captain, we are experiencing a two percent drop in energy reserves. Compensating. We were having problems... We are being bombarded with high-intensity radiation. Shields up! Captain, energy loss increasing. Yellow alert. Aye, sir. Energy loss increasing. Mr Crusher. Reverse course. Full impulse power. No response, sir. Increase speed to warp one. Engines aren't responding. Mr La Forge, warp power now! Matter-antimatter mixture-ratio settings at optimum balance. Reaction sequence corresponding to specified norms. Magnetic-plasma transfer to warp-field generators as specified. Commander, we should be going like a bat out of hell. Power loss now 1 2 percent. Red alert. Radiation intensity increasing. We'd better slow these engines down before we burn out. To idle, Geordi. Is it possible... that we've fallen into the same snare that killed them? A 1,000-year-old booby trap? Even with the engines idling, our reserves will be depleted in three hours. We won't hold our shields. Mr Worf, have you identified the source of the radiation? The radiation field is too strong for our sensors. And no explanation for the energy loss? No, sir. Is there anything in the history books, Data? Fascinating records of Menthar battle strategy. They were exceptionally innovative. They were first to use the Kavis Teke elusive maneuver, as well as strategy comparable to Napoleon's... Any situation like this? No, sir. I recommend I return with a team. They didn't have much success. But they knew their enemy. They may have known what caused this. Agreed. The impact of lowering shields to get the away team out? Negligible. And our energy conservation? Cmdr La Forge, keep the Enterprise up and running. Data, join the away team. Find out what happened on that ship. So why can't we move? Computer. As we increased power, was there any counter-reaction? Affirmative. The opposing force grew in direct proportion to the power output of the Enterprise. So, it kept us from forming a subspace field? That is correct. Computer... Who is this... L Brahms? Dr Leah Brahms, engineer. Daystrom Institute Theoretical Propulsion Group. Galaxy-class starships. Team seven, junior member. Junior member? Looks like she wrote the book on propulsion. Call up subspace design logs. Select menu. Visual records or L Brahms' voice entries. Voice entries. Theoretical propulsion logs, Federation Starship Enterprise. Galaxy-class. Heading, Subspace. Author, Leah Brahms. Geordi La Forge. How are you doing? Specify program. Yeah. Down to work. You're absolutely right. I recommend we evacuate all non-operational areas and group crew on the odd-numbered decks. Proceed. I'd like to set up an area for treating radiation symptoms. After the shields fall, how long before fatal exposure? 30 minutes. After that, there is nothing that can be done. Away team to Enterprise. Captain, we may have found something. There's a file of memory coils here. They are identical to the coil we found earlier. Captain's log? That's what we were thinking. Mr Data, are they working? I believe so. We can enhance them through the image processor. Good. Return at once. Aye, sir. Computer. Generate a cross-section of the dilithium-crystal chamber. What about re-orienting the crystal? It is possible to re-orient the crystal. The key lies in adjusting the lattice-structure direction. This modification will be integrated in the next-class starship. Sorry, can't wait. You and me, Leah, we've got two hours to figure this out. You know what I need to do? I need to get inside there. I need to be able to turn it inside out. Computer, is there a cross-section we can replicate on the holodeck? Select menu. Design specifications or prototype schematic. Prototype? Elaborate. A development-stage prototype schematic at Utopia Planitia. Drafting room five of the Mars station, stardate 40174. Perfect. Recreate it in holodeck three. Stay with me, doc. Ready, Computer? Holodeck three program is ready. Damn! Right back where it all started. This is incredible! Leah, did you design this? The dilithium-crystal chamber was designed at Outpost Seran T-One... ...stardate 40052. Some of the Federation's best minds participated in its development. That's the visiting-dignitary talk. What's the inside story? Off the record. Access denied. Personal logs are restricted. Great! Another woman who won't get personal with me on the holodeck. Leah. I want to supplement the energy supply to the ship and the engines. Could we alter the matter-antimatter paths? Theoretically, yes. The system should accept reactants at a faster rate of injection. Well, this is your baby. Show me which ones. Computer, did I ask for a simulation? Affirmative. You asked Dr Brahms to show you which system could accept reactants at a faster rate. By accessing available imagery, an adequate facsimile was possible. I did do that, didn't I? OK, well... It's good to see you, Leah. Continue with your analysis. Systems L-452 through L-575 will accept reactants, providing all other systems are calibrated to an equal factor. Then, if we use multiple streams hitting more than one facet... ...we could do it, hold our own. Leah, you're beautiful. La Forge to Picard. Go ahead. We found a way to extend the energy supplies. Well done. Can you get us out of here? Sorry, Commander, the first priority was to maintain the shields. Acknowledged. We'll get to work on it. Pass my congratulations to your team. Thanks, Captain. We're all smiles down here. Captain, we've been able to verify that these coils are the logs of the Promellian captain. But most of them have decayed and cannot be repaired. Any playback? On most, there are brief sections which may yield information. Do your best. Let's hope we can get the section we need. The Promellian must have logged the cause of the death. All in an open locker? He wasn't too concerned with security. 452 through system L-575. Adjustments to dilithium-crystal chamber complete. Impact analysis, Computer. Warp energy has increased 1 4 percent. Reactants per unit time remaining steady. Yes! Alright! Computer... Do you have any... you know, personality on file for Dr Brahms? Starfleet personality profile analysis, stardate 40056. Did she ever debate at the intergalactic caucuses on Chaya VII? Dr Brahms attended the caucuses on the following stardates... Never mind the dates. Computer... If you add data from all these sources, could you synthesise a true representation of Dr Brahms? There would be a 9.37 percent margin of error in the interactive responses from the facsimile. I can live with that. Do it. Dr Brahms? Geordi, it's me, Leah. Don't call me Dr Brahms, or I'll call you Commander. Right. Now... We've maintained energy but we can't leave it without burning out components. So we need to move. Are you with me? Yeah. Yeah! We have been stripped of all propulsion and our weapons are useless. We cannot move and we cannot fight. The ship is being lashed with lethal radiation from the aceton assimilators concealed in the wreckage around... Aceton assimilators? Primitive generators which drain power from distant sources. Generators? It would not be difficult to modify them to convert energy into radiation. The Menthars hide them in debris. An unsuspecting ship flies in. Instant booby trap. Now we're supplying the devices with the energy to kill us. No. Listen to me! You can't boost power that way. You increase the speed of the subspace field processor... I want enough power to barrel out of here, not blow us up. This is my design we're talking about. I don't care if you built it with your bare hands. It's gonna go... And we'll go with it. I am not used to being questioned. And I'm not used to dying. OK, look. You worked in a lab on a static model. This is a working machine. It's got tens of thousands of light years on it. True. Damn right. Listen. We'd never be certain that the circuit paths are sealed. You're good. Very good. I know my ship. Inside and out. Then you know me inside and out. Cos a lot of me is in here. I always wish a chief engineer was present when a ship is built. Yeah. Designers never get out in space. Well... you're there now. Cmdr La Forge to the bridge. On my way, Commander. Don't go away. I mean... Computer, save program. How many devices are we dealing with, Data? To create this radiation field would take several hundred thousand. They've been out there a long time. Deterioration? There is no way to calculate that. It is likely. Is there any indication of weakness in the field? Nothing substantial. Of any kind. Well, there is a 0.1 percent dip in the radiation field at... 21 mark eight by 42 mark zero. I want that 0.1 percent. Fire at those coordinates. We won't maintain energy reserves. We might even lose a few circuits. Critical losses? Not enough to shut down but I don't know about the shields. There is also the possibility that the phasers will supply what they need most. Energy. I imagine a similar discussion taking place on our neighbor ship. Over 1,000 years ago. Let's hope our decisions are more successful. Mr La Forge, return to Engineering and continue without delay. Mr Worf. Prepare the phasers. Phasers locked on coordinates. Fire. Nothing. Radiation levels increasing. Eight percent. Ten percent. Energy reserves are dropping rapidly, sir. Damn you. Wouldn't that increase the output to gain a quicker response time? The processors can handle the extra input. But how do we reconfigure? Energy reserves reaching critical. Standard procedure requires termination of all simulations. Override standard procedure. Override authority restricted. What? Computer! The crystal lattice is breaking down. We'll repair it at a starbase. The optimist of the group. How long do we have shields based on current calculations? Under two hours. The radiation field has increased by 1 7 percent. What impact on fatal exposure? Down to 26 minutes. If we resist, we die. If we don't resist, we die. Mr La Forge, have we shut down non-essential energy? Yes, sir. I need some back for a program on holodeck three. For what purpose? Well... I've gone back to the beginning, to the earliest entries. I've created a propulsion design model to assist me. I believe we're making progress. Computer, reinstate holodeck three program. Holodeck three program is reinstated. Mr La Forge, your best suggestion in one hour. Picard out. Computer, holodeck three program. Enter when ready. There isn't much time left. We have to get out of here. The booby trap eats energy. How do we fool it, block it, shut it down? OK, we know that for every move the Enterprise makes, there's a countermovement by the energy field. Can we use that to our advantage? Maybe. There must be a time differential between force and counterforce. If we can adjust the link-ups before the counterforce reacts, we might just move this bucket. Yeah. Yes! Leah, do you like Italian food? Like it? Wait till I make you my fungilli. OK. Fusion reactor uplink to navigation processor. Then we have to adjust the vector processor and the drive coils. This is impossible. Don't do that. I thought it would feel good. I don't want to feel that good right now. What time is it? Coming up on 1600 hours. God, what am I supposed to tell the Captain? It's possible and yet it's not possible. Everything says we can't adjust it but if we could, it might work. I could do it. Data couldn't even do it. It'll take a thousand adjustments a second. How will you do it? It's humanly impossible. I'm not human. You... You mean the computer could do it? Captain. Captain, this is... This is a simulation of the expert who designed the engines, Leah Brahms. We... I've been examining the force- counterforce response times, trying to create linkage at maximum power. And? There's a... There's a chance we could if we turn the ship over to the computer. What chance? I don't know. We could program it and try it out. And this is the only way? I think so, sir. Come. Any word from La Forge? He has something that may give us a chance, if we stay out of it. He proposes to turn the ship over to the computer because it is capable of quicker adjustments than a human being. Computers always impress me with their ability to take orders. I'm not as convinced of their ability to give them. You know, Number One, you missed something not playing with models. They were the source of imaginary voyages, each holding a treasure of adventures. Manning the earliest spacecraft, flying an aeroplane with only one propeller to keep you in the sky. Can you imagine that? Now the machines are flying us. End simulation. Fatal exposure. Computer, reduce thrust levels another four percent. Adjust trajectory angle to compensate. Begin simulation again. There you go, we got out. Repeat simulation, same levels. End simulation. Fatal exposure. Same variables, only the computer didn't quite make it. Deflector shield failure. Lethal radiation levels. Fatal exposure in 26 minutes. It might work. It might not. I can't turn the ship over to a computer. It's all we've got. Picard to La Forge. Captain. Two minutes. Give me just two minutes. There is another way, Captain. Two minutes, please! Two minutes, Mr La Forge. Picard out. Geordi, there's no other way. Listen. Turn it around. Come at it from the opposite direction. God, it's so simple it might work. OK. Computer, new simulation. We've only tried overpowering the trap. More energy, faster adjustments. That's what we can't do because we're supposed to do that. That's the booby trap. The answer lies in our own computer. The mind. The best piece of engineering ever. Didn't your research indicate we need a thousand adjustments per second? Not if we shut everything off. One blast of everything for a microsecond to beat the inertia and then we shut down, except for life-support and two thrusters. No impulse engines. No computer. One propeller? Deflector shield failure. Lethal radiation levels. Fatal exposure in 12 minutes. Have you analyzed the risk? The numbers say even. It's no better than the computer, but no worse. Forget the numbers. The computer can't compensate for human intuition. Experience. And the wish to stay alive. Make it so. I've run the simulations. I'll take the con. Thank you, Mr La Forge. You've done your job. I relieve you, Mr Crusher. Yes, sir. All hands, we are about to engage engines for a short burst. Inertia dampeners are on manual. They may not compensate for the acceleration. Brace yourselves. Deflector shield failure. Lethal radiation levels. Computer. Discontinue radiation warning until further notice. It's all yours, sir. Thank you. Firing impulse engines. Impulse engines down. Shutting down all systems. Velocity is 135 meters per second. We enter the debris field in eight seconds. Starboard thruster. Coming to. Heading three-four-zero. Mark one-zero. Thruster is off. Captain, that large mass may contain an assimilator. Port thrusters firing. No reaction from the assimilator. Over the first hurdle. Sir, object to port! Port thruster is firing. Sir, the gravity of the various masses has reduced our velocity by eight percent. By my calculations, we can no longer clear the debris field. Thank you, Mr Data. The asteroid's gravitation is drawing us closer. Velocity is increasing. Velocity is still increasing. Now at 219 meters per second. Starboard aft thruster. You used the asteroid's gravitation as a slingshot. Excellent! We're out. We got through. You have the con, Mr Crusher. Yes, sir. Full restart. All systems back on line. With pleasure, sir. Number One. Make sure that booby trap doesn't bother anyone again. Mr Worf, ready photon torpedoes. Set to detonate on impact with the Promellian vessel. Aye, sir. I've always thought technology could solve almost any problem. It enhances the quality of our lives. Lets us travel across the galaxy. Even gave me my vision. But sometimes you just have to turn it all off. Even the gypsy violins. Violins? Different program. We made a good team. Maybe we can again. I'm with you every day, Geordi. Every time you look at this engine. Every time you touch it, it's me. Computer, exit holodeck. End program. "
S3E07,"Placing beam-out marker. Return transport, 1 4 minutes, 40 seconds. Is your view any better, Geordi? Not too bad. A lot of charged-particle precipitation. I can compensate. Communicators are dysfunctional. Tricorders? Readings only valid within five metres. Good thing we didn't bring Data. We'd be unscrambling his circuits. Commander! Picking up something on the positron scan. Over here! Some electrically conductive objects. Recognise those markings, Worf? Yes, sir. Romulan. What the hell are they doing in a Federation sector? Picking up traces of ultritium residue. An explosive device must have destroyed the craft after it crashed. Let's spread out. 25-metre radius. Our window back closes in 1 2 minutes. Commander! Cmdr Riker! Four minutes to beam-up. Where is he? Wait here. Worf! Cmdr Riker! Geordi! Worf! Cmdr Riker! Hold your position, Mr Worf. Worf! Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 43349.2. An unidentified distress signal has uncovered a crashed Romulan vessel on the surface of Galorndon Core, a Federation planet. They have recovered one survivor. But Lt Cmdr La Forge did not report back with the away team and is still missing. Get him to sickbay. Post a guard at all times. He's not going anywhere, Lieutenant. Sorry. There's no way to lock in. Keep trying, O'Brien. The storm's creating thousands of ghosts. Beam those ghosts back! One may be Geordi. Permission to lead another team. Denied. When we get a window in the storms. The crash site? The Romulan craft is a loss. There's nothing to salvage unless you use tweezers. No others? You couldn't see two metres in front of yourself. It is the last place one would expect Romulan encroachment. On the other hand, Galorndon Core would provide ideal cover for the opening move of a new offensive. I doubt they were there for the climate. We thought it would be like working on Vulcans. But there are subtle differences. Too many. Can you treat him? He has damage to vital areas. He needs a transfusion of compatible ribosomes to recover. I'm setting up a schedule to test the crew. We can't use the replicator? It's too complex. Will he survive? I can't answer that yet. Will he survive long enough to tell us what he was doing? It's an important consideration. I can bring him around for a few minutes. But there is one serious complication. His brainwaves indicate early neural-pathway degeneration. Head injury? No obvious cranial trauma. I'm guessing the magnetic fields on the surface slowly broke down his synaptic connections. Will that affect Geordi? He'll be conscious for a minute. You are on board the Federation Starship Enterprise. We're treating your injuries. How long were you down on Galorndon Core? Do you understand me? I... will not answer questions. We need to know if there are other survivors. I am alone. I will not answer any questions. Do you have a mothership to advise of your condition? The only answer he gives is that he was alone. Which suggests that he wasn't. Something, anything, to cut through the storm. Some way to get a signal through to him. A neutrino pulse! We could build a portable neutrino source and send it to the surface as a beacon. A neutrino pulse would send particles up through the atmosphere and be detected by Geordi's visor. He can show himself by modifying the pulse. Make it so. Captain. I have a new transmission on a parallel frequency. From the surface? No, from inside the Romulan zone. We should be able to view the transmission. On screen. Tomalak to Pi. We have received your distress signal. Respond. If you can hear me, we are entering the Neutral Zone now. We will reach you in six hours. Mr Worf, hail the Romulan vessel. Hailing frequencies open, sir. Romulan vessel, this is Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise. The frequency is open, sir. Cmdr Tomalak, we have intercepted your transmission. You are not to enter Federation space. Capt Picard, my apologies. Had I known you were near, I would have advised you before crossing the Neutral Zone. Indeed? I am sure you will understand. One of our ships had a navigational error and crashed on Galorndon Core. A slight navigational error? Nearly half a light year past the Neutral Zone? I assure you, no aggression was intended. Commander. We have recovered one of your survivors. He is on board your ship? He is being treated for severe injuries. And his craft? Destroyed... deliberately. After the crash. I'm sure you are prepared to rendezvous in the Neutral Zone. I have a team on the planet. We have to beam them up. And then you will return my officer? Are there any other Romulans to recover from Galorndon Core? No. It was a one-man craft. Captain. We will be at the Federation border in roughly five hours. We will expect you to rendezvous at that time. Counsellor? There is great hostility behind his smile. He'll stop at nothing to complete his mission. Including the Neutral Zone border. Captain, I see no reason to return the Romulan. He should be held and interrogated. We have every right to detain him. Without evidence of intent, it will not be simple. It obviously wasn't pilot's error. It demands a response. But we must measure our response carefully, or history may remember Galorndon Core along with Pearl Harbor and Station Salem One as the stage for a bloody preamble to war. I want him off the drugs. They're not doing anything. Dr Crusher to Picard. Go ahead. My patient is not responding to treatment. You haven't found a compatible ribosome donor? The lab is still processing the tests. Early results indicate humans have many bio-rejection factors. I've also ruled out the Vulcans. I think I'll try old-fashioned medicine. Keep the fever down and let the body heal itself. Keep me advised. Picard out. The neutrino beacon is aboard a class-3 probe. Well done, Ensign. Mr Worf, launch the probe. Aye aye, sir. Probe has reached the surface, sir. The neutrino stream is strong. Sensors are tracking the probe despite the interference. A stationary neutrino source! Wesley Crusher. Thank you, Wesley! You are my prisoner! Right. Congratulations. Surely a strategic triumph for the Romulan Empire. Stay there! My shoes are full of sand. I hate that. Don't you? Name and rank. Lt Cmdr Geordi La Forge. I don't think I got yours. A Romulan ship will arrive shortly. You will accompany me on board. I don't think so. We heard your message, too, and well, the fleet's in. The sky's full of Federation ships. You're lying. I never lie with sand in my shoes. Get up! Seriously, the only way out of here is for you to put that thing down. When there's a window in the storm... Are you OK? You gotta be kidding. Sit! Welcome to Galorndon Core, where no good deed goes unpunished. Yes, Doctor? Lieutenant, good. Come in. Please sit down. We have found a compatible ribosome match for the Romulan. But only one. You. That is impossible. I am a Klingon. Different species, yes. But many humanoids have comparable cell structures. And you have what this Romulan needs. There's absolutely no risk to you. You understood that was the purpose of the testing? I have no objection to tests. You have an objection to being a donor? Yes. I understand your feelings about the Romulans, but this is not the time. If you had seen them kill your parents, you would understand it is always the time for those feelings. This Romulan didn't murder your parents. And you are the only one who can save his life. Then he will die. I sure wish you'd put that away. You're afraid of dying! You bet. Who isn't? I'm not. Right! To die serving my people... The Romulan path to glory. You can be sarcastic now. But in a few millennia, when humans are extinct and the Romulan Empire spans the galaxy... You really believe that stuff, don't you, Commodore? You may address me as Centurion Bochra. Bochra? Good, solid Romulan name. What's the matter? Nothing. Wrong. Your heart rate just shot way up. It translates radiation into neural impulses. It allows me to see. Without it, you're blind? Yeah. How did this happen? I was born that way. And your parents let you live? What kind of question is that? Of course they did! No wonder your race is weak. You waste time and resources on defective children. Whoa! I must be having some sort of... polarity shift. Diagnostic insists everything's fine. Your body temperature's gone up almost another point. What are you saying? I don't know. It must be this place, all that electromagnetic soup. It's wreaking havoc on our nervous systems. Your metabolism's messed up, so's my interface with the visor. We gotta get out. Sit down. Bochra. Sit down! What is that? It's just background fluctuation. He hasn't found it yet. Then he must be hurt. Or dead. When does our next window open up, Data? There is no indication, no way to predict. Incoming Romulan transmission. They're early. The Romulan warbird should be 29 minutes from the Neutral Zone. Close enough, however, to see that we are not there. On screen. Picard. I'm approaching the Federation border. The Enterprise is not to be found. Why? My away team is unable to leave the surface because of the storms. And my officer? He is alive. His life remains in jeopardy? Yes. And yet you will not permit me into your precious Federation space to retrieve him? If the point is not clear, let me make it again. Romulan warships do not enter Federation space unless they are to do battle. But a mission of mercy? A mission to recover one of your officers, who has been caught on a Federation planet for reasons as yet unknown. I have already explained. I rejected your explanation! Territories! You would measure territories against a man's life? I am singularly impressed by your concern for a life. Do not risk more lives by leaving the Neutral Zone! Picard out. Bochra. You're in bad shape. My vision's worse. There's a beacon to get us to my ship, but not if I can't find it. I cannot surrender to the Federation. Then stay here and die! If the situation were reversed... ...would you not die to avoid capture? I don't know. I might. If I thought the stakes were high enough. But they'd have to be pretty high. I guess I'd make a lousy Romulan! I no more wish to die than you do. Bochra. There are times when it's necessary to die for one's ideals. Do you believe this is the time? Come on. Let's go find that beacon. Whoa! What is it? Everything's gone blank. I'm blind. Come. Worf. You are busy. Forgive my intrusion. For what it's worth, I understand your bitterness. With respect, sir, you cannot. I am asked to give the blood of my mother and father To those who murdered them! You blame all Romulans? Yes. For ever? What if the Federation made peace with the Romulans? Impossible. That's what your people said a few years ago about humans. Think how many died in that war. Would you and I be here now if we hadn't let go of the anger and blame? Where does it end, Worf? If that Romulan dies, does his family carry the bitterness on another generation? Then you believe I should? What I believe... doesn't matter. My Starfleet training tells me one thing. But everything I am tells me another. Lt Worf to sickbay. Acknowledged. Lieutenant, his life is coming to an end. I thought it important for you to see him again. It's not too late to change your mind. Come close to me, Klingon. Let me die with my hands at your throat. There is a substance within my cells which you need to survive. Then you've come to hear me beg for my life? No. I would rather die than pollute my body with Klingon filth! I've lost almost all feeling in my legs. My synapses must be turning to jelly. The visor's fine. I just can't see a thing. How do we locate the beacon? We don't. Do all humans give up so easily? We're lost, unless you've got something that can smell neutrinos. We have the sensor device you are carrying. Tricorder? It's not set up to detect neutrinos. Your eye device does. Connect them. They don't speak the same language. Besides, I'd never be able to get an accurate sampling. Wait a second. I wouldn't need an accurate sampling, just a pointer. A neutrino Geiger counter. No, it's still not possible. You cannot do it? Under normal circumstances, maybe. Here? No way. Why? Because I can't see! Adapting the neural output of the visor can't be done by touch. Then I... will be your eyes. The storm is subsiding. We should have a window in an hour. There's still no indication he's found the beacon. Assemble a team. Sir. The Romulan warship has crossed the border. It is in Federation space and heading towards us. Belay that order, Number One. Red alert. Make sure the limiter matches the output range. Not so fast. Now, place the neural output pods in contact with the tricorder scanner heads. Ready. Let her rip. Bearing three-five-zero. We did it! The first Federation-Romulan co-venture. The storm may be breaking. With any luck, there'll be an electromagnetic window opening up. At which point, I'll be your prisoner. Can you walk? I don't know. Well, let's find out. Come on. OK, let's go. Straight ahead. To the right. Come. You wished to see me? Yes, Lieutenant. I assume you know what it's about. Yes. The Romulan vessel will reach us within the hour. If our patient dies... ...it may be just the excuse the Romulan commander needs to start an incident. The death of a Romulan officer at the hands of the Federation. Think of it. I have. So, there is no question that he is more valuable to us alive than dead. I understand. Lieutenant... ...sometimes, the moral obligations of command are less than clear. I have to weigh the good of the many against the needs of the individual, and try to balance them as realistically as possible. God knows, I don't always succeed. I have not had cause to complain, Captain. Lieutenant, you wouldn't complain even if you had cause. If you order me to agree to the transfusion, I will obey, of course. I don't want... to order you. But I ask you. I... ...beg you to volunteer. I cannot. Lieutenant. Sir? That will be all. Picard to Dr Crusher. Go ahead. Do not continue to enlist the cooperation of Lt Worf. I won't have to, Captain. The Romulan has died. We've found it! Now we alter its signal so the Enterprise knows we found it. Will that be difficult? Not with your help. The scanners are showing a window. Expected duration? Nine minutes, 40 seconds, sir. No change in the beacon's signal. Romulan ship approaching. Bearing 354, mark 287. On screen. Entering phaser range. We are being hailed, sir. On viewer. You have one chance to escape destruction, Picard. Return my officer at once. You have entered Federation space despite my warning. You forced the situation! I will not leave without him. He is dead. Then he... is but the first to fall, Picard. The Romulan ship is powering its forward disruptor. All shields to maximum. Aye, sir. Lock phasers on target. Phasers locked... and ready. The signal from the beacon is modulating. It's Geordi. But our shields are up. Lower them and the Romulans will strike. The electromagnetic window is closing. Three minutes remain. Transporter room, lock onto the beam and stand by. Standing by. The window is allowing intermittent readings. There are ghost images but we are picking up two life forms. Another Romulan? I cannot say. The interference prevents an accurate reading. But that's a likely hypothesis. If Cmdr La Forge has located a second survivor... Lieutenant. Hail the Romulan vessel. Aye, sir. They are ignoring our hail. Repeat the hail. They have no way of knowing how accurate our sensors are. Put on your best poker face, Number One. Open a frequency. Cmdr Tomalak. It would appear our away team has located a second man from your one-man ship. We're preparing to beam them up. After which, we will return the survivor to you. No acknowledgement, sir. Commander, both our ships are ready to fight. We have two extremely powerful and destructive arsenals at our command. Our next actions will have serious repercussions. We have reason to mistrust one another but even better reason to set those differences aside. Of course, the question is, who will take the initiative? Who will make the first gesture of trust? The answer is, I will. I must lower our shields to beam those men up from the planet's surface. Once the shields are down, you will have the opportunity to fire on us. If you do, you will destroy not only the Enterprise and its crew, but the ceasefire that the Romulans and the Federation now enjoy. Lieutenant, lower the shields. Leave the hailing frequency open. Yes, sir. Shields down. Mr O'Brien, transport La Forge and the Romulan to the bridge. Aye, sir. Energising. Security to the bridge. Belay that order. Shields up. No one is going to harm you. You have my word on that. Well, Commander? If he has been in any way mistreated... I have given them no information, Commander. But I have not been mistreated. In fact... ...this human saved my life. Tomalak. How is it possible that you didn't know of the second Romulan? A simple misunderstanding, Capt Picard. I was misinformed as to the size of the craft. I assure you, I intended no deception. Of course not. You doubt my good faith? My faith would be strengthened by a gesture from you. Such as powering down your disruptors. Disruptors powering down. Thank you. Cancel red alert, Lieutenant. We shall return your officer and escort you to the Neutral Zone. That is acceptable. Good to have you back. Good to be back. Actually, I have Centurion Bochra to thank for it. Indeed? Cmdr La Forge and Lt Worf, escort our guest to transporter room one. Yes, sir. Come on. Close call. Too close, Number One. Brinkmanship is a dangerous game. "
S3E08,"Computer, dispatches. An enquiry from the Journal of Interplanetary Psychology and three communiqués from your mother. Transfer the letters from my mother to the viewscreen. And, Computer, I would like a real chocolate sundae. Define ""real"" in context, please. Real. Not one of your perfectly synthesised, ingeniously enhanced imitations. I would like real chocolate ice cream, real whipped cream... This unit is programmed to provide sources of acceptable nutritional value. Your request is not within guidelines. Do you wish to override the specified program? Listen... Picard to Counsellor Troi. Now what? Yes, Captain? We're having an impromptu reception for the arriving delegates. I'm not really dressed for a reception. Throw anything on. It's our first look at the wormhole. Of course, Captain. I'm on my way. God forbid I should miss my first look at the wormhole! May I escort you? Tell me there's chocolate here. Counsellor Troi. Allow me to do the introductions. Premier Bhavani of Barzan, Counsellor Deanna Troi. Your discovery has produced much excitement. Hopefully, it will produce a new era of prosperity for my people. We'll see to that. Mendoza, the Federation negotiator. A pleasure to see you again. This is a worthy Federation competitor, Leyor of the Caldonians. Madame. And I'm Devinoni Ral. Ship's counsellor, Deanna Troi. My good friend Ral is the best hired gun in the business. Hired gun? My good friend Mendoza means that I'm a negotiator, who serves a variety of clients. Right now, I represent the Chrysalians. It's almost time. Indeed. It will be visible directly ahead. Is it always on time? Always. We see it every 233 minutes. It's due to radiation build-up in the accretion disc. The visible burst is very brief. There it is, ladies and gentlemen, the first and only stable wormhole known to exist. It's yours, for the right price. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 43385.6. We are orbiting Barzan Il, which is entertaining bids for control of what appears to be a stable wormhole which could provide a short cut to the distant Gamma Quadrant. The environment on my planet is inhospitable to most life forms. I'd like to express my appreciation to you, Capt Picard, for hosting these negotiations. Barzan society has depended on others for generations. We want that to end. The appearance of this stable wormhole in our space provides us with our first natural resource. We have neither the experience nor the technology to exploit it. But you do. Excuse me. A Ferengi delegation wishes to beam aboard. Were you expecting them? No, but I do not wish to create ill-will. If they want to bid, I have no objection. Chief O'Brien, this is Capt Picard. Will you beam the Ferengi to the observation lounge? Aye, sir. On behalf of all Ferengi, I protest. Why were we not invited? My apologies. We did not anticipate your interest. You're welcome to join us. My name is DaiMon Goss. These are my consuls, Kol and Dr Arridor. We'll need chairs. I'm Capt Picard. I'm the host for the proceedings. Good. Get us some chairs. Let me explain... Have your Klingon servant get us some chairs! I'm in charge of Security. Then who gets the chairs? DaiMon, due to the delicate nature of these negotiations, all parties agreed that one representative will suffice. Now, I will provide your consuls with accommodations and you may have my chair. Very well. Premier. Kol, the bag. Gentlemen, this way. We can handle the pleasantries later. Now, let's get down to business. I'll match anyone's best offer and add the gold on top of it. Devinoni Ral, human. Age, 4 1. Born, Brussels, European Alliance. Relocated at age 19 to Hurkos III. Come in. Should I call for an appointment? No. I was just looking over some personnel files. Well, that's too bad. I thought you might be thinking about me. I thought you'd be deep in negotiations. In recess. I never play the opening rounds. Inconsequential. Besides, there are much better things to negotiate. Like dinner tonight? What about your travelling companion? My travelling companion is... travelling. I sent her home. Why? You know why. Weren't you getting along? Don't do that. What? Don't do ""Counsellor"" Troi. Was I? Yes, you were. When you leave this office... who are you? Oh, so that's how it goes. You never do. You never do... leave... the office. What...? Dinner at eight? The readings from the probe of the wormhole are impressive. The wormhole delivered the probe beyond the Denkiri Arm in the Gamma Quadrant. It would take a century at warp nine to go that distance. It would take a matter of seconds through the wormhole. Imagine the Ferengi collecting tolls if they win. They're not the greatest threat at the table. For all of Goss's bluster, they don't have the resources the Barzans need. I think that Devinoni is the one that we need to watch out for. An accurate observation. How do you recognise that? He was so comfortable. You must play poker. Poker? Is that a game of some sort? Riker conducts masterclasses in poker. Our skills are not dissimilar. Mr Mendoza, if this lives up to its billing, it will be a discovery of extraordinary value. But it is a very big if. A wormhole comes and goes. A stable wormhole is unheard of. So this may not be what it seems? The Barzans do not have manned space travel. They used a probe. Its findings are limited. These charts do not show how stable the wormhole really is or how long it will remain intact. We could end up buying a proverbial lemon. Proverbial lemon? Later, Data. Aye, sir. Once the contract is negotiated, we'd be obliged to fulfil it. We should take a look. Bhavani can't object. Geordi has been in visual contact with the wormhole. He's the logical choice. I would like to volunteer. Nobody's going in until we've done a sensor analysis. I want to determine that it's safe. When I am satisfied, then you, Data, and Cmdr La Forge will enter the wormhole tomorrow. Just a moment of discomfort for a good cause, DaiMon. You understand this will not be lethal. Doctor, you surprise me. I have no wish to kill anyone. A short-term crippling will suffice. Then this will be just fine. A distillation of your own blood pyrocytes. Harmless to you, undetectable by the ship's biofilters. But when absorbed through your victim's skin, it will provoke an extreme allergic reaction. It's time to extend the hand of the Ferengi to the representative of the Federation. Much better. Thank you. Come in for a drink? Federation decor. Not your style? Well, conformity is not my style. What would you like? I'd even like another. Well, there she is again. Counsellor Troi. I'm not! Computer, champagne. For two. Am I moving too fast for you? No. I'm moving too fast for me. I like that better. I haven't been able to stop thinking about you all day. You must have had a nice day. Anticipation is fun. We'll be late for dinner. Very late. Mr Mendoza! I seem to be a bit warm. I need some help here. You attempt to gain every unfair advantage. Bhavani has no objection. Well, I do! First, you conveniently arrange to play host, then you plan to send a manned probe into the wormhole! The Federation thinks it can do what it wants. I will not tolerate it! I will share the results of our exploration with you. You expect us to believe what you report? Send in your own probe, Goss! That's what I intend to do. I strongly suggest that you stay out of our way! Tell Data and La Forge to stay out of their way. Capt Picard, come to sickbay. Acknowledged, Doctor. Whatever he's got, is not life-threatening. It's some kind of system-wide histaminic reaction. He can't go back to negotiations for several days. Will you keep me informed? The Federation's top negotiator taken out by a mysterious ailment. Suspicions? With the Ferengi around? Always. You'll have to fill in. Me? I'm the designated host. It would be a most awkward transition. You're the next likely choice. Mr Mendoza will certainly agree. He's impressed by your instincts. Those were poker instincts. A card game doesn't prepare me for this. The stakes are higher, but isn't that when the game gets interesting? The wormhole will reappear in 30 seconds. The Ferengi pod is in position. Shuttle nine, stand by. Ferengi pod, this is Lt Cmdr La Forge in the Enterprise shuttle. This is Dr Arridor. Go ahead. Would you care to take the point? We will gladly yield that honour to you, Lieutenant Commander. If this doesn't work, the thought of spending the rest of my life in here is not appealing. There is a bright side, Geordi. You will have me to talk to. It is visible, Captain. Proceed when ready. And intense energy fields which appear to be... They're beyond our communication capabilities, sir. An analysis of our bid is on the computer for your consideration. I realise how difficult this must be for you. If you don't understand something, don't be embarrassed to ask me. I have an idea what the rules are. That's what makes it interesting. The rules change to fit the moment. Not unlike commanding a starship. Mr Riker's placed a great deal of emphasis on defence, a subject he obviously knows well, having served Starfleet in several conflicts. Now, the Chrysalians, we're enemies to no one. And we choose to remain that way. Neutral. Neutral... and uninvolved, sir, in virtually all interstellar matters of consequence. No one would claim the Chrysalians are as powerful as the Federation. But we have resources and technology and scientists, too. But we also have had peace for ten generations. You know, I was thinking. Maybe I could stretch out these negotiations for a few days. Would you like that? Devinoni Ral. Who are you? Well, what do your Betazoid senses tell you about me? Not much. My human physical response must be blocking them out. Good. It never happened to me before. I rather like that I'm more difficult to read than your other men. There aren't any others. Currently. What about Cmdr Riker? Who have you been talking to? No one. I just sensed something when I saw the two of you together. Will Riker and I are good friends. It was once a little more than that. How come we're talking about me instead of you? Don't you have enough people talk about their lives to you? Who counsels the Counsellor? Oh, no. I want to know about you. I'm what you see right now. Just me. Wanting to run away with you, but knowing you never leave this damned ship. When I first saw you... ...I felt as if I'd been waiting for you. I'm trying to understand why or how that's possible. Does it matter? Well, it will... when I tell you. But you must never tell anyone else. What? I am part Betazoid, too. My mother was one half, I am one quarter. You're empathic? The only one of five children. But I must admit I was never as comfortable sensing emotions as you seem to be. So, that's why you left Earth? Yes. I learned to live with it, use it, as you have. But still, it isolates us, doesn't it? And I thought it always would, so I tucked my heart away. I didn't need it. I didn't want it. At the negotiating table, it can be fatal to have a heart. But I never realised how much I needed mine until I looked at you. There's an increase in accretion matter filtering in. Monitors are functioning normally. Ferengi pod, everybody in one piece over there? Our condition is no concern of yours. We are competitors, not partners. Ferengi pod out. Yeah, happy landings to you, too. Curious! We are not where we are supposed to be. We're on the other side of the wormhole. According to the Barzan probe, we should be in the Gamma Quadrant. But these readings indicate we are 200 light years away in sector 3556 of the Delta Quadrant. Maybe the Barzan readings were wrong. Perhaps the readings were correct. Their probe could have exited the wormhole at a different location. I'm picking up subatomic fluctuations. Meson and lepton activity is increasing. So is gravitational acceleration. Something very strange is happening to this wormhole. Sorry! You're unusually limber today. I'll say! Devinoni Ral. It's ridiculous... and wonderful. I feel completely out of control. Happy. Terrified. But there's nothing rational about this. Who needs rational when your toes curl up? I'm afraid I'm going to lose myself. I can't get enough of him. Is it possible to fall in love in one day? I did. It was like this for you and Jack? No. It was another fella. I fell in love in a day and it lasted a week. But what a week! Then I met Jack. It took months to figure it out with him. Well, then maybe I should slow down. Catch my breath. Not let this thing get out of control. No. No. To be honest, I was surprised to see the Caldonians here at all. You must think Caldonia very insular, Mr Ral. No, not at all. On the contrary. I've always respected your world's commitment to pure research. It's just that... Well... Go on, please. Well, scholars don't always enjoy administrative demands. We've seen that the administration of the wormhole... Yes, I must admit, I have begun to feel some trepidation about that. Yes, I'm sure you have, Leyor. I'm sure we all have. In the next century, the number of ships that will pass... Gentlemen, this session is called by request of the Caldonian delegation. Madam Bhavani, Caldonia withdraws from the proceedings. For what reasons, Leyor? It is clear that the administrative requirements are beyond our abilities. The Federation would like an agreement. We could acquire your planet's rich deposits of trillium 323 which we would add to our bid, Premier Bhavani. My apologies. We have made an agreement with the Chrysalians. Mr Ral? You either had good instincts, or foreknowledge of the withdrawal. Some people just don't like to do business with the Federation. The Chrysalians hereby add the Caldonian trillium 323 to its bid, Premier. I tell you, it's changing! I can see it with my visor. I am not leaving yet. We have not finished taking readings. Listen, Doctor. Your readings must be telling you this is not the Gamma Quadrant. I will not confirm your speculations. This is not speculation. We are not where the Barzans said we should be. This side of the wormhole is not stable. There are meson and lepton fluctuations. Gravitational fields are increasing. We'd better go! It will be visible in 40 seconds. We will make our judgements then. I can see it now. You don't have time to wait, not even 40 seconds. Ferengi pod out. Damn it, Arridor! We're 70,000 light years away from our ships! Follow us in. We'll lead you. Idiots! It's getting worse. I'm taking us in, Data. With or without them. Thrusters at half-power. Three quarters. Entering outer event horizon. They panic quickly under pressure. There. Precisely as scheduled. Right where I expected it to be. Everyone was talking today about the way you absorbed the Caldonian bid. Well, the opening was there. I took it. Cmdr Riker didn't know how you did it. Let me tell you something about Cmdr Riker. He's good. He's the most dangerous man in that room to me. But he doesn't have an edge. Your edge. Our edge. You make it sound unethical. Isn't it? Deanna, it's just business. Why haven't you told anyone you're an empath? I find it makes people uncomfortable. I think you don't tell them so you can gain an advantage. I gained an advantage by using it with you. You didn't seem to mind that. Look, Deanna. The point of negotiating is to take advantage. I don't know what they're offering. They don't know what I'm offering. We dance around until someone wins. I never cry ""foul"" when I lose. But you're reading their emotional states, their inner selves, and using that to manipulate them. People have done that for thousands of years, just by listening carefully, by watching body language. I just happen to be better at it. You do it. I do it to help my crew, not outmanoeuvre them. And I don't hide that I'm an empath. So you announce it to every alien culture you encounter? Or do you use it to your side's advantage? Do you tell the Romulan that's about to attack that you sense he may be bluffing? Or do you just tell your captain? That's different. That's a matter of protection. Yes, protection. Your protection, your captain, your crew, your edge. Yes. It's a matter of life and death when you take the advantage. Me? I deal in property. Exchanges. Nobody gets hurt. So, you tell me, which one of us would you say has more of a problem with ethics? Excuse me. May I join you, Commander? Bought out the Ferengi yet? Should I give it a try? No, but I think you will. It'll come down to you and me. You're very good at this, much better than you realise. I hope I'm better than you realise. The last mile of a marathon is the toughest, when the winners are willing to take risks. You willing to do that? We'll see. Let's see now. I'm prepared to reach an agreement with Bhavani before we learn the outcome of your probe's expedition. Are you? Well, well, well. The Federation would not look favourably on that. You have to be willing to take that last step alone, or it isn't worth playing. Your point of view, not mine. I see that. Otherwise you wouldn't be second-in-command of this starship. You know, I feel responsible for you, in a way. Related. Deanna. We both love Deanna. In different ways of course. I will remove that burden of responsibility now. My relationship with her stands well on its own without help from you. Of course. It's just that... Well, she's a remarkable woman. Brilliant. Lovely. Very passionate. She could have been yours, but you didn't do enough to keep her. And now, well, I'm here. And I'm going to take her, too. That's the first bad play I've seen you make. If you can bring happiness into Deanna's life, nothing would please me more. You're really not such a bad sort, except you don't have any values, beyond the value of today's bid, that is. Deanna is just the woman to bring some meaning to your sorry existence, if you're smart enough to take it. I doubt that you are. To the last mile. Sir, the Ferengi vessel is moving out of orbit. Impulse power. They are approaching the entry to the wormhole, sir. Computer, is Goss still on board the Enterprise? Goss departed at 1 400 hours. They're powering missile launchers. Yellow alert! Hail the Ferengi. Explain your actions, DaiMon Goss. I've learned that the Federation has manipulated negotiations from the beginning, and has already signed a secret agreement. That is not true. Our offer was never seriously considered. Bhavani welcomed you despite my better judgement. We will be ignored no longer! They've fired a missile at the opening. Destroy it! On screen. Firing phasers. Your offers both have merit. If I could find a deciding factor... Riker to Picard. What's happening? Goss fired a missile at the wormhole. I need you on the bridge. Excuse me. Excuse me for saying so under the circumstances, but this fight seems to really be between the Federation and the Ferengi. It seems unconscionable that your wormhole is being used as a pawn in their struggle. You know we will not allow you to do this. If we cannot have the wormhole, no one will. A missile won't destroy a wormhole, but it could destroy the shuttlecraft. Casualties of war, Captain. My men are prepared to die. Are yours? Captain, he's lying. I'm sure of it. He doesn't mean it. Why? What is he doing it for, then? Permission to enter? With all due respect... I'm in a better position to settle this with Goss than you are. May I address him? Premier. DaiMon Goss, this is Ral. I have nothing to say to you. Then just listen. Barzan has agreed with the Chrysalians for long-term control of the wormhole. On behalf of the Chrysalians I offer the Ferengi free access to the wormhole in perpetuity. I have your word? Yes, my word, in exchange for Ferengi convoy privileges to be negotiated in good faith. This is an acceptable offer. The Ferengi vessel has shut down its missile launcher. Stand down red alert. Cmdr Riker. I'm sorry you had to learn about my decision this way. You represented the Federation well. But I believe that the Chrysalians' tradition of peace is more desirable to my planet. There's something you should know. Was there something you wanted to say? No, not at all. I sensed you felt uncomfortable. Well, it was a very tense situation. But that's what's so odd. It wasn't tense at all. I sensed no tension from you or Goss. But I was tense! I was ready to blow it up! I strongly protest. Screen off! It was as though you were performing a scene. Captain, I believe there's a conflict of interest. I agree, entirely. Mr Ral asked me not to tell anyone he has empathic powers, which he uses to manipulate his competitors in a negotiation. And, yes, it did put me in a conflict of interest, which I hope I have now resolved. Premier, I believe Ral used your fear of continuing aggression between the Federation and its enemies to undermine our position. I also believe that this incident was staged by Ral and Goss to provide you a reason to choose in favour of the Chrysalians. The shuttlecraft are coming back through. Shuttle nine to Enterprise. On screen. This is shuttle nine reporting in. Barely! The Ferengi pod? Trapped on the other side. Delta Quadrant. We warned them. They wouldn't follow us. Elaborate. This end of the wormhole is currently stable, but the other shifts positions periodically. The Barzan probe had no way to recognise this. Eventually, both sides will be unstable. It's a dry well. Worthless. Acknowledged. Main shuttlebay, prepare for final approach. Aye, sir. Goss demands to know where his men are. Advise him to set his coordinates for the Delta Quadrant. He may run into them in... 80 years or so. Mr Ral, congratulations on winning the rights to the Barzan wormhole. I take the risks, Mr Riker, and I stand by my agreements. Come in. When do you leave? Soon. The Chrysalians have recalled me. Explanations demanded and so forth. I'm sorry. I've done well for them over the years. They understand the stakes. It'll be fine. I had to do it, Troi. Bhavani was ready to go with the Federation. I sensed it. I'd used every card. I needed to change the rules. You must have known I couldn't allow that. My human physical response must have been blocking my Betazoid senses. I'm very grateful for what you did, in a way. It's made me take a hard look at who I am. I don't like what I see. I once asked you to run away with me. Now I'm asking again. I need you. You could help me change. You could be my conscience. I already have a job as Counsellor. "
S3E09,"Someone sure stripped this place. The reactor's gone. No wonder they didn't answer our hail for two days. Nothing here to answer with. I am detecting life signs from behind that door. Worf! Commander? Take a look at this. Blood. Yes, but not human. I'm gonna have to do some analysis on it. It's jammed. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. The two scientists are suffering from phaser stuns. I'd guess several hits each. Several? It'll take a while to revive them, but they will recover. We found a sample of blood. It's a rare iron-copper composite, unique to one humanoid species, the Acamarians. Acamarians? Then that would suggest the Gatherers. It is a likely hypothesis. These nomadic marauders have raided other outposts in neighboring sectors. They've never come out this far before. Mr Crusher, set course for the Acamar system. Aye, sir. Captain's log, stardate 43421.9. To try to put an end to the Gatherer raids, we have come to the Acamar system to enlist the aid of Marouk, the Sovereign of Acamar III. Their raids have made this sector unsafe. Trade routes have been disrupted. The Gatherers are elusive. We've only managed to capture a handful of them. But with Starfleet's help... Hunting them down is not what I am proposing. Reconciliation with the Gatherers is impossible. It's been tried. Every time we offer amnesty, they reject it. When was the last attempt made? 18 years ago. 18 years? For almost a century, they've been parasites, moving between star systems, living on what they found or stole. They're still your people. No. Captain, you have to understand our history. A hundred years ago, before the Gatherers split off from our culture, we were a savage, violent race. Clans battled clans. Vengeful feuds that lasted for generations. But we overcame those ways, all except for the Gatherers. After a century of wandering, they may be ready to come home. Despite your progress, you will remain a divided society until the Gatherers return to Acamar. The attempt may be futile. But there is so much to gain and so little to lose by the effort. This problem affects us all. It cannot be ignored. Sovereign, welcome to the bridge. Thank you, Captain. How soon will you be ready to leave? I'm ready now. I need only bring two more servants. I'll see to that and to accommodations. I have reason to believe there is a Gatherer encampment somewhere in the Hromi Cluster. Mr Data? The Federation has charted several Class-M planets in that area. Any one of these planets might serve well as a base. Mr Crusher, set course for the Hromi Cluster. Aye, sir. A fine ship, Commander. We're all very proud of her. Yuta, a light meal in 20 minutes. May I be shown the kitchen, Commander? You're the chef? Yes. I'll cook for the Sovereign and her servants. We can provide a kitchen, but it won't be necessary. These food dispensers can synthesise anything you need. I'll show you. Sovereign, a drink? Yes, thank you. Cold water. Computer, a glass of water, five degrees. Please. You're also the food taster? That's part of the cook's duty. I'm sure the Sovereign will wish to sample your ship's cuisines, but there are Acamarian dishes she will insist upon. I'll arrange for your recipes to be programmed. Of course, I'll have to try some. What's your specialty? I have none. Don't be modest. You must have come up with a few culinary delights. There is a spiced parthas dish. Parthas? A green vegetable with fleshy roots. Parthas a la Yuta. I look forward to tasting it. Sovereign. Chef. Entering standard orbit of Gamma Hromi II. I am detecting life readings from the planet surface as well as areas of thermal radiation and carbon dioxide emissions indicative of combustion. Campfires, Data. Is that not what I said? It's worth a look. Make it so. Data? Worf? Artonian lasers. Tonkian homing beacons. Quite a collection. Noranium alloy, sir. Its salvage value is quite low. The Gatherers weren't too discriminating. Commander? Ambush! Rigelian phaser rifles. Not particularly powerful. Powerful enough. We came to talk! Your words are wasted. They understand only this. We're here to establish a dialogue. Data, noranium vaporises at...? 2,31 4 degrees. Noranium carbide... Thank you, Data. Setting seven ought to do it. Three, two, one. Now! Enterprise, four to beam up. Cowards! Your ambushes would be more successful if you bathed. We've brought the Sovereign. Marouk? Here? With an offer of amnesty. Full dispensation to all Gatherers willing to return to Acamar III. You don't trust me, Marouk. Should I? But you expect me to trust you. Maybe you just poisoned it yourself. Taste this, Temarek. Barbarians. This is futile. Sovereign. Brull! Go home, old woman! You people haven't changed in 100 years! You should know. You were there! Sit down! Please. Please. We're here to talk. It's a waste of time, Captain. They don't care how they live. Am I to believe you care how we live? Yes. Brull, she's here, isn't she? Maybe you forced her to come. Nobody forces me anywhere, Brull. What is there for us on Acamar III? A life. A home. You can end your wanderings, your miserable existence. Do I look miserable to you? The clan wars are over, Brull. It is a past we're ashamed of. It is why you had to leave. Now... it is time to come home. I want to speak privately with Sovereign Marouk and Picard. Everyone else, get out. Any insights? Brull's ready to negotiate. He wants privacy so he won't appear weak in front of the other Gatherers. You are of the clan Lornak. What of it? I've seen you before. Yes. But... it's impossible. No. Look closer. I am Yuta of the clan Tralesta. I am the last of my line, but my clan will outlive yours. Marouk's offer has value. Commander. But still, I don't know. But it is enough to present to your leader? Chorgan is a better judge of these matters. I will take it to him. You'll hear from me in 20 days. Brull, in 20 days, I hope to be very far from here. With all due respect, Brull, I would like to make the offer to Chorgan myself. We'll take you on the Enterprise. How many of your men do you want to accompany you? I'll come alone. If this is a trap... It isn't. Mallon, you'll be in charge while I'm gone. If I'm not back in 10 days... Brull! Volnath. Enterprise, medical emergency. Volnath was old. Nothing can be done. There's a chance our doctors can do something. You found him? Yes. There are no other Lornak here, so I claim his possessions. Granted. Have you no respect for the dead? What's there to respect about a corpse? No. Temarek, no. He's been dead too long. How? Cardiac arrest. You don't sound convinced. No, he died of a heart attack, but I can't find the cause. His cardiac muscle is strong. No sign of arterial occlusion. Brull, will you show Mr Crusher the course to set to the Hromi Cluster? A child? This doesn't inspire my confidence. This is our present position. Set a heading for 343, mark 72. That'll take us through the centre of an asteroid belt. What's the matter, kid? Can't you fly around a couple of rocks? Sure I can. But if we take this heading, we can avoid the belt completely and only lose 12.1 minutes at warp seven. Have it your way, kid. For centuries, my planet was in chaos. Loyalty to one's clan was absolute. The slightest injury to one member demanded violent retaliation. And these blood feuds could last for decades? The obsession with vengeance would pass from generation to generation. And with each act of retribution, the violence would escalate. It's not unlike much of the history of my own planet. Your pardon. May I be excused briefly? Cmdr Riker requested I make him an Acamarian dish. Of course, Yuta. What are you doing? Homework. What is this? Math. I can see that. What does it mean? It's the Euclidean metrisation of a K-fold contravariant tensor field. You any good at it? You don't like me. I didn't say that. No problem. I have many friends that don't like me. What do you know about me? You're a thief. I steal to survive, not because I enjoy it! We Gatherers value our freedom. We answer to no creature! Then why help Marouk change that? Maybe because I want something better. For me... and for my children. You have children? Yeah. Two sons. One's just about your age. He's not any good at math. Parthas a la Yuta. With the help of one of your food stations. It's wonderful. Truly excellent. Thank you. Care to join us? I don't want to intrude. You're not. I was just leaving anyway. Please, sit down. It really is delicious. Glad you like it, Commander. I'm not your commander. Call me William. If you prefer it. I do. You say ""Commander"" like you say ""Sovereign"" to Marouk. As a servant. You're an excellent commander but you'd make a poor sovereign. Why? Not that I disagree. You're uncomfortable with servants. I prefer to be with equals. So, you treat me as an equal? You're uncomfortable with that? I'm not used to it. I've always been a servant, not that I'm complaining. The Sovereign treats me well. I have all that I could want. What about freedom? I can never have that. You're owned by the Sovereign? No. I'm not her slave. I can leave whenever I wish. But you have no place to go. Just the opposite. My path is all too clear. Yuta, you're an excellent chef, but you speak in riddles. I've never been very good at conversation. Yuta. I believe the Sovereign wants me to return. Enjoy the parthas. Sickbay to Riker. I've discovered something interesting. On my way. You're scowling, Doctor. I'm thinking. And? The old Gatherer on the planet? I know what caused his heart attack. The tricorder almost missed it but he had a microvirus in his body blocking his autonomic nerve impulses. And that stopped his heart? But here's the really interesting part. This microvirus only attaches itself to cells with very specific DNA. How specific? Without knowing more about their genetics, I can't be sure. But my guess is, this virus would only kill one Acamarian in a million. Pretty single-minded bug. Too single-minded. I can't believe it's a naturally-occurring virus. Meaning it was engineered? Meaning Volnath was murdered. Cmdr Riker, Acamar III has granted you access to their databases. They are now being transmitted into our computer. Good. Notify Dr Crusher when the medical database is on line. Riker out. Come in. I'm disturbing you. Not at all. As... ...the Sovereign has no further need for my services tonight, she suggested I spend some time with you. What a charming suggestion. She appreciates the... ...affection you've shown me. Was I that obvious? Yes. I've already dined. Maybe you know a good Acamarian dessert recipe. Does that not please you? Tell me what you want. I will do anything you wish. Wait a minute. I don't understand. Don't you want me to give you pleasure? Not as a servant. I told you, I prefer equals. Even in the matters of love? Especially in matters of love. I've offended you. No, I only want to make you as happy as you want to make me. You're entitled to that. No. I'm not. I do not feel pleasure or passion. I haven't been able to for a long time. I don't know who did this to you. Or why. But it can change. I wish it could. Tonight most of all. I'm sorry. A warm welcome from your people. That's Chorgan's ship. Shields holding. Mr Worf, contact Chorgan. Tell him Brull has brought us to talk. Chorgan is not responding. Mr Worf, can we knock out their shields without seriously damaging their ship? I believe we can, sir. Prepare phasers and open a channel. Phasers locked. Channel open. Chorgan, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterpri... Alright. Let's focus their attention. Mr Worf, fire phasers. Their forward shields are inoperative. Well done, Lieutenant. We are being hailed, sir. That's better. On screen. Brull, you traitor! You have led them here to destroy me! If I had wanted you destroyed, you would not be talking to me now. Obviously, I wanted something else. And what is that? I have on board Marouk of Acamar III. Listen to her and Brull. She's worth listening to. I don't wish to listen. You have no choice. We're beaming on board. Picard out. Cancel red alert. Tell Marouk to meet me in transporter three. Aye, sir. You're going alone? The danger is minimal. Chorgan won't do anything rash with our phasers trained on his ship. There are still risks. For these negotiations to succeed, I must be a mediator, not an enforcer. You have the bridge, Number One. Chorgan, this is Sovereign Marouk. You may sit. You will find Marouk's proposal... You know, Picard, I could take you prisoner. Oh, don't worry. I've no intention of doing so. I know what trouble it's been for you to get here, and I am curious why. Then let's proceed. Quite simply, I'm proposing amnesty for every Gatherer. Amnesty? You mean slavery. If you want to know what I think... I don't! Say what you came to say. I doubt I'll believe you. I didn't believe this persuasive Federation Captain when he suggested reconciliation. I'm convinced now it's right, not just for you, but for us, too. We need you back. I've brought some Acamarian brandy. I'm sure it's been a long time. No! You have spent a century hunting us down. She is trying to end all that. Luring us back, putting us in jail. No, by accepting you back as free men. Will you feed us and clothe us, too? No, of course I won't. What I will do is give you the means to feed and clothe yourselves. We've set aside some land and you can use it to... Land? Do we look like farmers to you? Then don't farm. Use the land as you wish. It's yours. The moment you set foot on it, you'll be better off. You won't be running any longer. We will need autonomy. Autonomy? We can at least acknowledge that Chorgan appears willing to discuss your offer. There are many levels of autonomy. Your region would have certain rights. Yes. And those rights will be spelled out before I agree to anything. Commander, I am afraid the only entry we have on Volnath in the Acamarian database is a birth record. Probably one of the last Gatherers to be born on their planet. Commander? I've been searching the medical database from Acamar III. I found another victim of the microvirus that killed Volnath. But only one. 53 years ago, a Gatherer named Penthor-Mul. Data? Anything in your file on Penthor-Mul? Yes. He was a member of the Lornak clan. He was captured while leading a raid on an Acamarian outpost. He died of a heart attack before his trial ended. Display Volnath's birth record again. Lornak. The same clan. The only two deaths by this microvirus are from the same clan. What does that tell us? If the microbes are engineered to kill, I'd say somebody is going after a whole family. Commander, Chorgan, the present leader of the Gatherers, is also from the Lornak clan. I want to know how this clan was involved with the blood feuds and who their enemies were. How is this virus transmitted? More ways than I can count. It's safe to the carrier as long as he has different DNA. Tailor-made for enemies. Commander, 80 years ago, the Lornaks massacred a rival clan, the Tralestas. It ended a feud that had lasted 200 years. Ended it? Records show there were no survivors. The Tralestas were annihilated. Something tells me they weren't all wiped out. There must be a missing link. Computer, any members of the delegation from the Tralesta clan? Clan affiliation is not within records. Sir, I have found a correlation between the two deaths. Your missing link. That is Penthor-Mul being led from his trial. I don't see the connection. Behind him and to the left, sir. Computer, scan left and magnify. The computer can extrapolate the rest of the face, sir. Do it. But that photograph was taken over 50 years ago. 53 years ago, and she hasn't aged a day. Three seats on the ruling council? If we are subject to your law, we want a part in making it. I agree you're entitled to representation but not on the ruling council! Unacceptable! The real power is in the council. You're shutting us off already. You're trying to take too much. No group has three seats! I don't care what others have! You only care about what you can take! Sovereign, if the situation were reversed, I'm sure you would demand equal levels of representation. You're right, Captain. I apologize for my temper. Perhaps a brief pause would be helpful. I agree. Maybe a little touch of that brandy. Yuta. You know... Thank you. It is remarkable how very much alike the two of you actually are. Ridiculous! Captain! No, I'm serious. You are both able negotiators, strong leaders. We don't obey weak leaders! We haven't agreed to anything. You're wrong, Chorgan. We've agreed to have brandy. Don't move! A trap! I assure you my First Officer has a very good reason for his actions. You do, Number One? Yuta, move away from Chorgan. Do it. Why? Because of a man you once knew named Penthor-Mul. Penthor-Mul? How do you know Penthor-Mul? Tell him, Yuta. I don't understand. You were with Penthor-Mul when he died. It was 50 years ago. How...? I know, Yuta. Stop! Chorgan, keep perfectly still. Your life is in danger. Step back, Yuta. This is not your concern. It is now. You're about to commit a murder. It isn't murder! It's justice! Who are you? Yuta of the clan Tralesta. There are no more Tralestas. Five survived the last Lornak raid. But on that day, a century ago, my life ended and my search began. I was the one chosen, transformed. My cells were altered and my ageing slowed, enough to finish my task. You used me in order to get to the last few you couldn't reach. Yes, Sovereign. You will never leave this ship alive. You're the last. Once you're dead, what happens to me doesn't matter. The wars are over, Yuta. You cannot understand. You're right, I can't. Because I've seen the part of you that regrets what you've become. You don't have to do this any more. I have no choice. You do. William, I... I'm sorry. Stop! Don't do this. Commander, I am in your debt. Yes. Thank you. New orders from Starfleet. The rendezvous with the Goddard has been postponed. In the meantime? Starbase 343. We're taking medical supplies for the Alpha Leonis system. Sounds pretty routine. With the Gatherer truce in effect, it should be. We won't require a full ship's complement. I'm going to extend shore leave to anyone who wants it. I'll pass that along to the crew, Captain. "
S3E10,"Brother John Bates, is that not the morning which breaks yonder? I think it be; but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day. Who's there? A friend. Under what captain serve you? Under Sir Thomas Erpingham. Pray you, what thinks he of our estate? Even as men wracked upon a sand, that look to be washed off the next tide. He hath not told his thought to the King? No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I speak it to you, I think the King is but a man, as I am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me; in his nakedness, he appears but a man. Therefore his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are. Yet no man should possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army. He may show what outward courage he will, but I believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck. Methinks I could not die any place so contented as in the King's company, his cause being just, and his quarrel honorable. That's more than we know. Or more than we should seek after. If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us. But if the cause be not good, the King himself hath a heavy reckoning to make; for all those legs and arms and heads, chopped off in a battle, shall join together at the latter day and cry all, ""We died at such a place."" The King is not bound to answer the endings of his soldiers, the father of his son nor the master of his servant. Splendid, Data. You're getting better and better! Freeze program! Thank you. I plan to study the performances of Olivier, Branagh, Shapiro and Kullnark. Data. You're here to learn about the human condition. There is no better way of doing that than by embracing Shakespeare. But discover it through your own performance, not by imitating others. Riker to Picard. Go ahead, Number One. An unidentified craft is in the Neutral Zone, heading toward Federation space. We're on our way. Picard out. We'll get to the rest of the act another time. Computer, file program and clear. Captain, why should a king wish to pass as a commoner? If he is the leader, should he not lead? Listen to what Shakespeare tells you about the man. A king who had true feeling for his soldiers would wish to share their fears with them on the eve of battle. Sir, will I be able to schedule a performance for the crew? Let's not rush it, shall we? Sierra VI confirms our readings. A Romulan scout ship. Bearing 270, mark 1 4. A scout ship. This far into the Neutral Zone? Shall we transmit a warning to withdraw? Open a hailing frequency. Aye, sir. Captain, the Romulan is hailing us. Visual. Not within range yet. Open a channel. Federation ship, do you read? I require urgent assistance. This is Capt Jean-Luc Picard... Please help me! Requesting asylum. Under pursuit. Pursuit? Visual range. On screen, Captain. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Red alert. Open a channel to the warship. Cut to intercept course. Channel is open. When do they reach Federation territory? 41 seconds. Romulan warbird, this is Capt Picard of Federation vessel Enterprise. You are in the Neutral Zone and are engaged in hostile action. Explain yourself and your intent. No reply, sir. Hail the scout. Responding. On screen. Federation craft, please! You must help me! We are moving to intercept. Maintain course and power. Scout ship is damaged. Engines inoperative, shields down. Position? Coordinates 1 40 by 205, sir. Federation space. Move to within five kilometers. Extend our shields around the scout ship. The shields won't take much punishment. Five kilometers, sir. All stop! Extend shields. Shields in place. We've got the scout ship. Weapons on the warbird are powered. Lock phasers. Open a channel. Ready. Romulan vessel, you are in Federation territory. Unless you withdraw... No argument? The warbird is in the Neutral Zone, heading for Romulan territory. Power failure to the scout ship. All systems going off-line, including life support. Prepare to beam the occupant of the scout ship aboard. Aye, sir. Mr Worf. Mr Data, lock on to the scout ship. Take it in tow. Energize. I must see your captain. First we go to the sickbay. This cannot wait! I have information vital to your survival. Captain's log, stardate 43462.5. We have beamed aboard an apparent Romulan defector, who claims to be a low-ranking logistics officer with extraordinary information about a secret offensive. Their defeat at the Battle of Cheron has not been forgotten. The new leaders vow to disregard the treaty and claim the Neutral Zone. Nelvana III is just the first step. A base has already been established there? Within 48 hours, the reactor core will be on-line. The Federation sensors that monitor the Neutral Zone just missed it?! It would seem so. In two days, a fleet of Romulan warbirds will be within striking distance of 1 5 Federation sectors. The Federation will not permit that! Then it is war that we're talking about, isn't it? Destroy the base now and the threat is over. I'm sure you are fatigued by your ordeal and require medical attention. Lt Worf, conduct Sublieutenant Setal to the sickbay. We will attend to your quarters. No doubt you will wish to question me further. No doubt. He tells a hell of a story. You don't believe it? The Empire knows we'd never allow it to build a base in the Neutral Zone. That would not be an atypical Romulan ploy. In their long history of war, Romulans rarely attack first. They test their enemy's resolve. I think he's a plant. If we go into the Neutral Zone, we look like the aggressors. The Romulans would have an excuse to respond in force. Exactly. Also not an atypical Romulan ploy. It's always a game of chess with them, isn't it? He's given us a chance to look at some Romulan technology close up. Mr La Forge, lead the away team. Commander, you and Troi will conduct Setal's interrogation. Captain, permission to observe? No, Mr Data. I need you on the bridge with me. We have less than 48 hours to prevent a war. Or perhaps to start one. This will depend on establishing the truth... I set the autodestruct before I left the ship. Why? Wouldn't you, to prevent your ship being captured? I'm confused. I thought you were defecting. I'm not a traitor. All you can see is the opportunity to exploit me. The Federation credo, exploitation. You couldn't get aboard my ship fast enough. Strip it down. ""What secrets might it reveal that we can use?"" You're a short-sighted people. Can't you understand? I came to stop a war. If you could just hold still? With your metabolism, this will heal in a few moments. Thank you, Doctor. How fortunate that you know something of Romulan medicine. I had a chance to gain some experience recently. Yes. The incident at Galorndon Core, the two officers. You are aware of a great deal for a logistics clerk. It was common knowledge. I can show you my rating code. Forged credentials are simple for a spy. How do you allow Klingon pahtk to walk around in a Starfleet uniform? You are lucky this is not a Klingon ship. We know how to deal with spies. Remove this tohzah from my sight! Your knowledge of Klingon curses is impressive. But, as a Romulan might say, only a veruul would use such language in public. Mr Worf, please see to the security for our guest's stay. Aye, sir. You find something amusing? Lt Worf. I like him. To be more accurate, I understand him. A warrior, proud, fearless, living only for combat. Exactly the type that will get us all killed, if we're not careful. This is the food station. You can reach me through the comm panel. Later, we'd like to ask you a few more questions. Computer? Water. Temperature? 12 onkians. This system is calibrated to the Celsius metric system. Any temperature, on the cold side of your system. There is no unusual activity in the Nelvana system. Let's isolate and magnify that system. Nothing on the sensors. It's hard to believe in what one cannot see. And yet conceivably, with their cloaking technology, a fleet of Romulan warbirds could be passing before our eyes. There must be some way to neutralize this advantage. Priority-one message from Starfleet coming in on secured channel. In my ready room. Computer, delay time? Two-hours-22-minute delay from transmission from Starfleet Command on Lya III. Computer, key access 41 2, mark 80. Picard, Jean-Luc, Starfleet priority code Gamma. Decode. Begin message. We have received an official protest from the Romulans, demanding the defector's return. Obviously, we're refusing to comply. I join in your scepticism, but if it is a deception, the Romulans are making a good show of it. The Federation Council will hold an emergency session. I have no doubt this will eventually fall on your shoulders, Jean-Luc. You've got him. You must decide if he's telling the truth. For now, I suggest you proceed along the Neutral Zone border, toward a Federation position proximate to Nelvana III. Picard to Lt Worf. Yes? Please come to my ready room. Aye, sir. On my way. Slow playback. Display engine logs and power data for both vessels. Now, watch what happens at 095433 on the clock. The scout has engine damage. He slows to 0.61 5 impulse power. The warship should overtake. But it doesn't. 2.6 seconds later, the warship slows to precisely the same speed. Three speed fluctuations. The warship kept its distance. They didn't want to catch up. Yet, they fired on him. They could've killed him. Not necessarily. The Romulans have the same capability to direct the impact of their weapons as we do. Is there a possibility the wound could be self-inflicted? They're very bad burns. I hardly think... A possibility. Yes. Captain's log, stardate 43463.7. We're at the Neutral Zone border, proximate to Nelvana III. If our guest is telling the truth, there are 21 hours until the Romulan base becomes functional. The Monitor and the Hood are headed your way but will arrive too late to help. Warnings have gone out to all outposts along the border and to several independent vessels nearby. No one here wants a war. But we will take them on, if that is what they want. All Federation starships are on yellow alert. Come. You wanted to see me? I want you to prepare a class-1 probe. Set it for maximum scan. I want every meter of Nelvana III monitored. I will start my calibrations. Data? Is there something else you require of me? Your clarity of thought. Your objectivity, as always. Sit down. It's very possible that we are about to go to war. The repercussions of what we do during the next 24 hours may be felt for years to come. I want you to keep a record of these events, so that history will have the benefit of a dispassionate view. I will begin immediately. Is that all? How is the crew's spirit? They are concerned, of course, but confident. Do you not see that, sir? Data, unlike King Henry, it is not easy for me to disguise myself and walk among my troops. That'll be all. ""Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the king who led them to it."" Why waste time playing this game? There's more than you're telling us. You're holding back. I have told you everything about Nelvana III. I don't mean the base. The base is all that matters! You're lying. Go to Nelvana III, you'll see. We will go nowhere without the truth. You're a spy. No! Then prove it. Tell me the location and strength of the Romulan fleet. I don't know it. A logistics officer?! For one sector! Your superior? Jarok. Where are the bases in the Zone? I don't know. In your sector? The number of troops under Jarok? Irrelevant! Irrelevant! I guess you're right. It's not worth playing this game. What a fool I've been! To come looking for courage in a lair of cowards. Message from security officer, Klingon vessel, Bortas. Mr Worf, handle this at Security station, deck nine. Aye, sir. Sensors are configured for probe. Ready for launch. Proceed. Probe on course. Sensors are functioning. Coordinate with Mr La Forge. I want this report with dispatch. My gut tells me we ought to be listening to what he tells us. Your gut? It's just a feeling. An instinct, intuition. Those qualities interfere with rational judgement. Sometimes they do. Then why not rely strictly on the facts? Because you can't rely on the plain and simple facts. Sometimes they lie. They can lead to the wrong conclusions, but they cannot lie. Yeah? What do you think? Is he a defector or not? The facts lead to the conclusion that he is not. I think we'll catch the Romulans with their pants down on Nelvana III, just like he says. With their pants...? A metaphor. Catching them in the act. Because your gut tells you so? Exactly! You can't always go with your gut either. It's a combination, Data. I'll put it this way. These feelings that get in the way of human judgement, that confuse us, make us second-guess ourselves, we need them to help us fill in the missing pieces, because we never have all the facts. So a person fills in the missing pieces of the puzzle with his own personality, resulting in a conclusion based as much on instinct and intuition, as on fact? Now you're getting it. But what does one do if he has no instinct or intuition? Data. Look at this. The facts just took a left turn. As the probe went into orbit, it began picking up low-level radio emissions. Could they be naturally occurring? No. The patterns are clearly artificial. It was so faint, our sensors couldn't read it. Can we decode it? We're trying. We can't be sure it's Romulan. And there are ionisation disturbances. Cloaked Romulan ships could produce that effect. And the planet's surface? Reading nothing but barren rock. They may be able to hide a base from our probe. The only way we'll know for sure is if we go down and take a look. That'll be all, gentlemen. I take it you have never seen a Romulan before. That would be an incorrect assumption. Then why do you invade my privacy? I was trying to ascertain what my guts tell me about you. You're the android. I know a host of Romulan cyberneticists that would love to be this close to you. I do not find that concept appealing. Nor should you. I am told by various crew members that this viewport is their favorite on the ship. I thought it would bring me some comfort. But these are not my stars. Even the heavens are denied me here. Synthetic swill. Would your food terminals be capable of producing a Romulan ale? That would require the molecular structure of that beverage. As you are aware, our knowledge of your planet is limited. The loss is yours. For I have visited over a hundred different worlds, and none possessed the awesome beauty of Romulus. Am I correct in assuming you regret your decision to come here? What I did had to be done. But never again... ...to see the firefalls at Gal Gath'thong. And the spires of my home, as they rise above the Apnex Sea at dawn. It's a bitter thing to be exiled from your own home. It is unlikely you will be allowed to return to your planet. The cold reaction of an android. But perhaps we can bring Romulus to you. Program complete. Run program. After you. The Valley of Chula! I know it well. You are free to stay here as long as you wish. I no longer live here. Turn it off. Cancel program. This... This is my home now. My future. I have sacrificed everything. It must not be in vain. Arrange a meeting between myself and Capt Picard. Tell him Admiral Jarok wants to see him. We have confirmed that you are holding Admiral Alidar Jarok. He was commander at the massacre at the Norkan outpost. The Council strongly advises you consider Jarok an unreliable source of information. Bring him in. Ensign, will you wait outside? Have a seat, Admiral Jarok. Captain, there is no more time. Admiral, have a seat. You see, I'm just not convinced that you are telling the truth. What must I do? You must convince me. If I had irrefutable evidence... You did not bring irrefutable evidence. You brought no evidence at all. Now, here, you are not the man you claimed to be. Admiral, your credibility is stretched beyond belief. A Romulan defector is almost a contradiction in terms. But Admiral Jarok crossing the lines? I explained my motivations to your interrogators. Yes, yes. Peace in our galaxy. Except, you are not a man of peace. Your military record, what we know of it, is clear. Which is why I chose an alternate identity here. The massacres in the Norkan outpost, for example. What you call massacres were called the Norkan Campaigns on my world, Captain. One world's butcher is another world's hero. Perhaps I am neither one. On what basis, Admiral, am I to decide? Your good word? Will you help us overpower the warbirds we may encounter? Will you help us detect them through their cloaking shields? Well, you see my problem. You ask us for faith, in circumstances hardly possible to believe, compounded by lies and your refusal to tell us what you know! I cannot betray my people. You already have. You've made your choices, sir. You're a traitor. If the bitter taste of that is unpalatable to you, I am sorry. But I will not risk my crew because you think you can dance on the edge of the Neutral Zone. You've crossed over. You make yourself comfortable with that. Do you have any children, Capt Picard? A family? No. Then you have sacrificed too much for your career. Yes, this is all very interesting. There comes a time in a man's life that you cannot know, when he looks down at the first smile of his baby girl and realizes he must change the world for her. For all children. It is for her that I am here. Not to destroy the Romulan Empire, but to save it. For months, I tried desperately to persuade the High Command that another war would destroy the Empire. They got tired of my arguments. I was censured, sent off to command some distant sector. This was my only recourse. I... ...will never see my child's smile again. She will grow up believing that her father is a traitor. But she will grow up. If you act, if we stop this war before it begins... I can't. And I won't. Unless I have unequivocal cooperation. Admiral Jarok has provided me with the locations, strengths and tactical plans of the Romulan fleet. Mr La Forge, he will give you data regarding engines, weapons and the cloaking systems of the warbird-class starship. But his experience as a field commander will be more valuable strategically than technically. Any edge will help. Don't depend on it. He may be lying. We shall find out soon. Number One, set course for Nelvana III. Second Officer's log, stardate 43465.2. We have entered the Neutral Zone, violating the Treaty of Algeron. If the Romulans are monitoring us, we expect heavy resistance as we approach Nelvana III. Tactical? Nothing on sensors. I don't like it. I would've expected a greeting party. You echo another noteworthy commander. A countryman of yours. George Armstrong Custer, when his 7th Cavalry arrived at the Little Bighorn. May we have better luck. Approaching Nelvana. Engage impulse engines. Nelvana III on screen. Still no signs of them on sensors. In a way, I'd rather be fighting through this. It's too easy. Prepare to enter standard orbit. Data? Scanning the planet, sir. No life forms, no power sources, no weapons. No indication of a base at all? No, sir. The signal the probe detected? The ionisation disturbances? I am picking them up, but I cannot identify the source. They seem to be moving in an orbital path with an 800km apogee. Lt Worf, bring the Admiral up here. Aye, sir. Maybe they abandoned the planet after he defected. There is no scarring on the surface to denote heavy construction. A cloaking device to hide the entire base? A cloaking device would be given away by visible distortion effects. Perhaps you would explain why we are here, Admiral. There doesn't appear to be a base. I don't understand. Nelvana III! No base! No weapons! No sign of any life at all! But I saw the tactical communiqus. The records. Timetables for completion. An entire legion was assigned to this section. Could they have been feeding you disinformation? You had been censured. Reassigned, four months ago. They knew of your dissatisfaction. Could all this have been to test your loyalty? No. It's impossible. They let you escape with an arsenal of worthless secrets. What other explanation is there? Permission to leave the Neutral Zone? At your earliest convenience. Helm, bring her round. Geordi, get us out! I hear you, Commander. Two Romulan warships uncloaking. Coordinates... Shields holding. Damage? Damage to the secondary hull. Power transfer fields may be pinched off. I'm working on it. Captain! Not yet, Mr Worf. This is just a tap on the shoulder, or we wouldn't be talking about it. The Romulans are hailing us. On screen. Capt Picard. I hardly expected to see you again so soon. This time, you are the one who has made an aggressive move across the Neutral Zone. Cmdr Tomalak, as I'm sure you already know, we were responding to warnings of Romulan incursions at Nelvana III. But, Captain, as you can see, there is no incursion. The unidentified radio emissions, the ionisation disturbances? You must mean our orbiting probe. We are studying Nelvana III for archaeological research. With a cloaked satellite? Really, Captain. Would you have us believe this satellite is an excuse for your charge across the Neutral Zone? Believe what you wish. We will be on our way. Without even an apology? If an apology will do, then I offer it. I'm afraid it won't. I'll save you the humiliation. Get to it, Tomalak! You see, after we dissect your Enterprise for every precious bit of information, I intend to display its broken hull in the Romulan capital as a symbol of victory. It will inspire our armies for generations, and serve as a warning to any other traitor who would create ripples of disloyalty. All the communiqus, all the timetables, all the records. They were all fiction. Written for my benefit. A test. A test of my loyalty. And you used me to lure the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone. First, Captain, you will return the traitor, Jarok. Then you will surrender as prisoners of war. Do you expect me to accept those terms? No, Capt Picard. I expect you won't. You have 30 seconds to decide. I do not require one, Tomalak. I urge you, Capt Picard, surrender. Consider the men and women you would lead into a lost cause. If the cause is just and honorable, they are prepared to give their lives. Are you prepared to die today, Tomalak? I expected more from you than an idle threat, Picard. Then you shall have it. Mr Worf. Aye, sir. Klingon warships armed and ready, sir. What shall it be, Tomalak? You will still not survive our assault. You will not survive ours. Shall we die together? I look forward to our next meeting, Captain. Romulan disruptors are powering down, sir. Cancel red alert. Mr Worf, extend the appreciation of the Federation and my personal gratitude to the Klingons. Aye, sir. Take us back, Number One. I did it for nothing. My home. My family. For nothing. He ingested a Felodesine chip. He must've brought it with him. There was no antidote. A letter to his wife and daughter. Sir, he must have known it would be impossible for us to deliver it. Today, perhaps. But if there are others with the courage of Admiral Jarok, we may hope to see a day of peace when... ...we can take his letter home. "
S3E11,"Captain's log, stardate 43489.2. We have arrived at Angosia III, a planet that has expressed a desire for membership in the Federation. Prime Minister Nayrok has taken us on a tour of the capital city. I'm very impressed with everything I've seen. I hope it will reflect favourably in your report. Your recovery from the Tarsian War is a tribute to your people. It is, indeed. We are not warriors. Reason should settle disputes, but not all cultures agree with us. An unfortunate reality. Development of the mind, cultivation of the intellect... These have been Angosian pursuits for centuries. Prime Minister, I'm sorry to interrupt, but we have a problem. May I see you for a moment? Excuse me, gentlemen. Yes, what is it? They'll make a fine addition to the Federation. I'm not sure I'd like to live here. A bit stuffy for my taste. A prisoner has escaped from the penal colony on Lunar V. Two guards are dead. The prisoner has taken a transport vessel. Can you pursue him? Our station's been sabotaged. The entire base is in chaos. We have ships following him, but our civilian pilots are not trained for this. With your permission? Data, a stolen transport vessel's departed from Lunar V. Did you pick it up on the sensors? Yes, Commander. Good. Quarantine the pilot. Is he armed? Yes. And dangerous. Lunar V is a maximum-security facility. Did you read that, Data? Yes, sir. We will use extreme caution. Keep us informed. Riker out. On screen, sir. Specifications on the vessel? No warp drive. Minimal weaponry. Heading, Mr. Crusher? 31 9 mark 250, sir. Vessel speed increasing to .02 impulse. He's seen us, Data. That's the ship's drive section. Where's the rest of it? Scan for life form readings. None. Bring us around to the back of the asteroid. Sensors show wreckage on the surface. No life-signs. Apparently he did not survive. Data, the drive section... Where did it go? There's no sign of it. Someone must be at the helm. Status report, Mr. Data. The prisoner has eluded us, sir. Eluded the Enterprise? Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. We followed procedures precisely. Scanners showed no life forms in the drive section. I cannot explain how he escaped. Incoming message from Angosia. On screen. We've identified the prisoner. His name is Roga Danar. He has a long criminal record, and is given to bouts of uncontrollable violence. I appreciate your warning. We will keep you informed. How fast can that transport ship travel? Without warp drive, it wouldn't be out of our range. There's nothing within sensor range. Cloaking device? Not an Angosian capability. Unless he's borrowing one. Huh? Hanging over the planet's pole would confuse our sensors. Commander, I can recalibrate our sensors to read through magnetic interference over the poles. We'll try. Realign for polar orbit. Aye, sir. There he is. You were correct. He knows all the tricks. Still no life-form readings. Could it be magnetic interference? No, I have compensated. We'll have an answer shortly. Lock on a tractor beam. Tractor beam locking on, sir. He is coming about. He's out of his mind. Massive power build-up in his thrusters. On main viewer. He's making a suicide run. Shields activated, beam disengaged. He bounced off the shields! An interesting twist. Fix coordinates onto that vessel. We'll beam it into a shuttle bay. That will not be necessary. He is no longer in the drive section. What? I anticipated that diversionary tactic from his pattern to date. We are picking up a cylindrical object, seven metres in length and three metres in diameter. On screen. Magnify. An escape pod! This guy's incredible! Yet still no life-form readings. Prepare to beam aboard from inside that shuttle anything large enough to be a humanoid adult. Aye, sir. Security team, report to transporter room four. On our way. Contents in stasis, pending the arrival of security. An illicit weapon has been detected in the transporter beam. It's been rendered inoperable. Worf, let's greet our guest. Bring him in, Mr. O'Brien. Stay where you are! More security, transporter room four! More security! More security! Get him to a detention cell. Set phasers on maximum stun. Commander... We'll need time to get our containment field operational before we pick him up. The damage he did during his escape was considerable. We'll await your signal. We're grateful. The prison psychologist suggests that you keep Danar fully sedated until he's ready for transport. He's in our highest security detention area. There shouldn't be any problems. Do not relax security at all. He is extremely violent and very cunning. I will send a transport vessel to pick him up. Nayrok out. Have you run a diagnostic on the sensors? There is nothing wrong with the ship's sensors. The reason we did not pick up life signs is because the prisoner has no life signs. Computer, identify the occupant of the detention cell. The detention cell is vacant at this time. He's in there. Is he an android? Our sensors can identify artificial life forms. Apparently, he's capable of deceiving the sensors. Are you alright? What is this ship? You're on the USS Enterprise. A war vessel? A Federation starship. Federation! We were orbiting Angosia when you escaped from Lunar V. It seems that I'm a victim of my own bad timing. Are you the keeper of this jail? I'm Deanna Troi, ship's Counsellor. Counsellor? Too bad. I'd rather you were my jailer on my return trip. I assume we are returning to Lunar V. That terrifies you. I killed three men to get out of there. I'm fully capable of killing you as well. That's a terrifying thought, isn't it? Even to me. Do they mistreat you there? Not at all. I'm comfortable, well-fed and housed. The Angosians take good care of prisoners. It's simply a matter of never being able to leave. What about you, Counsellor? You always visit prisoners? Are you a specialist in criminal behaviour? Or am I just an interesting specimen, an insect to be studied under your microscope? Why all this anger toward me? A girl with long, dark hair broke my heart a long time ago. Out of bitterness and resentment... ..l turned to crime. How about this one? My mother abandoned me when I was little. I never got the guidance that I needed. Why are you doing this? Playing games? Isn't that what you do, Counsellor? Isn't that what mind-control experts do? I am not a mind-control expert. I'm here because I sensed you were in pain. And what do you sense now? The pain is gone. It's interesting, isn't it? There's a duality about the man. It's hard to describe. He's aware of his crimes. They trouble him deeply. Counsellor... He's intelligent, thoughtful, typically Angosian. I know what he's done. But when I'm with him, I can't believe he is deliberately violent. In fact, inherently, he has a non-violent personality. It took five men to restrain him! And he damaged the transporter room. I'm not opening the door for him, Captain. I can only tell you that I sense something unusual about him. Something that is not inherent to a criminal personality. In a few hours I'm giving him to the Angosians. And I'm happy to. I understand. Data, do we have a link-up with the Angosian central computer? Yes. We are copying records for Federation inspection, pursuant to their application. Can I see a police record on Roga Danar? There is no record. Impossible. He's been in prison. Lunar V is a military prison. Military? He's a soldier? That may explain his tactics when we tried to capture him. It doesn't say here what he was arrested for. Call up his military record. He served in many campaigns during the Tarsian War. Received two promotions to the rank of subhadar. An honourable tour of duty. What was this man's crime? I've learned you are a soldier. I was a soldier. Why were you in prison? Because I'm a threat to society. There's no police record. What did you do? Everything they asked me to do. That's why I became such a threat. I don't understand. Why are you bothering to try? Because I want to help. Unlock the door. You are a non-violent man. Yet you committed acts of excessive violence. You can learn to do it if you have to. Did you have to? It was war. So, it started with the war? It started the day I volunteered. The day I began training. The day I met my first instructor. And he also called himself a counsellor. Roga Danar was an idealistic young man who answered his people's call to service. He joined the military to fight for the Angosian way of life. He didn't realize that by doing so he'd have to give up that way of life for ever. He's not the same man who left home to go to war. He's been through intense psychological manipulation and biochemical modifications. I examined him. His cell structure has been significantly altered. They used a combination of cryptobiolin, triclenidil and a few things I can't recognize. Was he a prisoner of war? Who did this to him? His own government. He's been programmed to be the perfect soldier. He can be normal, but when danger is perceived, the programming takes over. Memory, strength, intelligence, reflexes, all become enhanced. He's conditioned to survive at any cost. A novel substance in his cellular structure even shields electrical impulses. Perhaps that is why our sensors did not detect him. Why was he assigned to the Lunar V facility? He committed no crime. He says he was ordered there with others like him. When the first soldiers returned to Angosia, they had trouble. The rules changed too quickly. A lost temper could result in murder. Counsellor, did no one attempt to adjust their programming? They were just exiled to Lunar V. Lunar V, an orbiting gulag. What do you want? Am I disturbing you? Yes. Then I will leave. No, wait! I'd rather talk to someone. Why do you have yellow eyes? I am an android. We have something in common. We do? Yes. We have both been programmed. Ah, yes, you've been talking to Counsellor Troi. It's not at all the same, android. I am not belittling your condition. I understand your dilemma. But I am curious. My program can be altered. Yours cannot? The man I was is still inside me, but this... this conditioning has been imposed. Woven together with my thoughts, feelings and responses. How do you separate program and man? Without further analysis from Troi or Dr Crusher, I cannot say. But I believe it is possible. Yeah, doctors! Angosian doctors did this. If they could, wouldn't they have undone it? I cannot answer that. Nor can l. Yet I ask myself that question every moment of every day. He's been telling you half-truths. He's a prisoner. What do you expect him to say? Please clarify it for me. The soldiers were resettled on Lunar V. It was to be their colony. Was it a resettlement of their choosing? It was for their own and others' protection. Most were happy. We did everything to give them a fine quality of life. Even the most comfortable prison is still a prison. A few agitators like Danar forced us to add security. My medical team suggests that there may be alternative treatment. Captain, every alternative has been explored. We are now discussing internal security, which is not your concern. I've dispatched a ship to transport the prisoner back to Lunar V. On behalf of Angosia, I thank the Federation for its assistance in retrieving our citizen. ""Matter of internal security."" The age-old cry of the oppressor. Were you built for combat, android? No. But my program includes military strategy. That was how I anticipated your final tactic and captured you. You did that? Perhaps you're better at combat than you think. Except I am not programmed to kill. My improved reflexes have allowed me to kill 84 times. My improved memory lets me remember each of those 84 faces. Do you know how that feels? I am incapable of any feeling. Then I envy you. Roga, this is Capt Picard. Captain. Mr. Danar, I'm transferring you to Angosian security. They're en route. I wanted to tell you I have no choice. The Prime Minister insisted. We have no right to refuse. You would be foolish to consider it otherwise, for they are correct. I am dangerous. There is no place for me in a ""civilized"" society. I do not believe that. Nor do l. I respect my officers' judgments. I wish I could help further. If a way appears, I will. I appreciate you telling me that. You deserve that much. You deserve to know I must use whatever means I can to escape. Captain, the Angosian transport vessel has arrived. Inform them the transfer will take place shortly. Picard out. Mr. Data, to the bridge, please. Take care of yourself, android. I enjoyed our talk. I, too. Perhaps when this planet joins the Federation... I will not be there to see it, Counsellor. Even with this demand to survive they've built into my soul, I would rather die than return to Lunar V. We're ready to receive the prisoner. Transmitting coordinates of the holding cell. Coordinates received. Stand by for transport. Picard out. Have security precautions been taken? Between release of the force field and activation of the transporter there will only be a .1 second gap. Even Danar can't move that fast. There will be a full security contingent present. Proceed. Transporter room one to Lt Worf. We're ready, sir. Energizing. Increase transporter... I'm losing him. Don't! You'll be killed. What the hell...? Security personnel, shut down shuttle bays, transporters and turbo lifts. Captain, a phaser is missing. We must assume he is armed. Sound general quarters. Clear all corridors of non-essential personnel. We don't want him taking hostages. General quarters sounded. Raise security containment fields immediately on decks 34, 35 and 36. Aye, sir. Put the turbo lifts back on. He may use them. As soon as he does, we have him. Sir, unauthorized access of turbo lift five on deck 34. He took the bait. Override destination. Divert that turbo lift to a position near to Lt Worf. Four seconds to arrival. We're in position. Phaser on overload. Seal this deck. Captain, the overload has been averted. Drop force field on deck 36. Sir, containment field down on deck 36. How did he do that? He's headed for Engineering. Riker to La Forge! Engineering, respond! Engineering! Engineering, come in! Geordi, are you OK? Captain, someone in Engineering is overriding the security lockout. Riker to Worf, he's in Engineering. Acknowledged, Commander. We're on our way. Data, stall Danar. Allow him to think he's succeeding. As he bypasses each subsystem, I can reroute it. Make it so. Danar is extremely adept, sir. I am not sure which security measure he is circumventing. Sir, Danar has succeeded in restoring power to shuttle bay two. I have overwritten Danas bypass. Shuttle bay two is once again inactive. Very good, Mr. Data. Now we know where he's headed. You OK? Geordi! I'm alright. He took us by surprise. He came out of nowhere! No one moves that fast! Lieutenant, I am reading an open panel. K- 12, J-9, deck 30. Acknowledged. Danar must have climbed up and gotten into a Jefferies tube. He could be anywhere. He's aiming for shuttle bay two. 25 decks up. Quite a climb. I wouldn't put it past him. Full security at all shuttle bays. You want my advice? Double it! Captain, reading another open access panel. Security to Jefferies tube J-4, deck 1 5. Acknowledged. Deck 1 5, a few decks below the shuttle bay. I find it unlikely Danar is trying to reach shuttle bay two. Explain. In our previous encounter, Danar employed a strategy of misdirection to gain his objective. You think he's using that tactic now? He is aware our sensors cannot track him, yet he leaves a trail. Where do you think he's headed? His true destination is a mystery. Readings indicate an open access panel in Jeffries tube N-1 1 , deck 38. He's doubled back on us. The cargo bays. Everyone out of the cargo bays. Aye, sir. Status, Data? They appear to be empty. Good. I want you to flood them with anesthizine. Aye, sir. Sensors show anesthizine concentration 70 parts per million within the cargo bays. That'll put him to sleep! Return environmental conditions to normal, Mr. Data. Move in your security teams, Worf. Acknowledged. Worf to bridge. No sign of the intruder but there's a missing pressure suit. Pressure suit? Could be he's planning to enter shuttle bay two from the outside. Post security guards at all emergency airlocks on decks 37 through 39. Aye, sir. I'll cover the photon torpedo launchers. Danar may attempt to leave the ship that way. Worf out. Danar! You are cunning. You must have Klingon blood. But the battle is over. My battle is never over. Worf to Bridge. I have Danar. Explosion in Jefferies tube, section T-95. All sensors inoperative. Go to backup systems. Unable to transfer control, sir. Sit down, gentlemen. Worf to bridge. Go ahead. Danar has escaped. His phaser powered the cargo transporter. Coordinates indicate he beamed aboard the Angosian ship. Data, can you verify that? Negative, sir. External sensors still non-functioning. Then we can't track him. That was his plan all along. First Officer's log. Supplemental. We continue to repair the ship's sensors since the escape of Danar. He is still at large. I'm getting readings. Are we back up? That's affirmative. Worf, sweep the area. Captain, the Prime Minister is hailing us. Priority one. On screen. Priority channel cleared. Yes, Prime Minister? Ive just been informed Danar has attacked the penal colony on Lunar V. Attacked it? In our own police shuttle. People have been wounded. Hundreds of prisoners are rioting. Some escaped with Danar and are heading towards the capital. Captain, we are not suited to handle situations like this. That's what we created them for. I'll send an away team. Picard out. Troi, Data, Worf, you will accompany me to the planet. These men are programmed to survive. Is that correct? Yes, Captain. And they won't kill unless their survival is at stake? It is against their nature to do so. Let's hope they do not believe their survival is at stake. Mr. Worf,... you are responsible for the Captain's safety. I understand, Commander. I doubt they'll listen to reason. I loathe the idea of violence, but we must be prepared. This is all? Where are your security men? We're not here to fight your wars. They're moving towards the city centre. People are scared. Captain, they are dangerous. You're dangerous. They're only victims. You made them what they are. They defended your way of life. Then you discarded them. They were not happy here. They were not welcome. The people wished them resettled. No one was pleased, but we had to act for the greater good. If you have the skills to create a master soldier, can't you counteract the effect? The chemicals can be removed, but we don't think the psychological conditioning can be reversed. Have you tried? We studied it thoroughly. Before training began, we knew there'd be problems. It was a risk. Did you reveal that risk to the men? We were helping them to survive the war. They needed those skills. Your brothers, sons. You turned your backs on them. There are methods of treatment. Until you try, how do you know they won't work? A partial recovery could give them some peace. It was the will of the people! To allow them to suffer?! There was a referendum. The people weighed the costs involved. They chose the settlement solution. Besides, we may need them again some day. Have you understood what...? Freeze! Nobody move! No, Worf! All of you! Don't respond. Don't provoke them further. Keep all weapons down unless you wish to be killed. Do as he says. No! Don't. Shoot us. Destroy us. Do what you have to. But you will not ignore us. Go on, do it! Cowards! Yes and you're not programmed to murder cowards. If they won't fight back, what will you do? We will not go back. You are programmed to survive. You can survive on Lunar V. To survive is not enough. To simply exist is not enough. Roga, tell them what you want. We want our lives back. We want to come home. I am not prepared to negotiate under threat, Danar. But if you put down your weapons and return to Lunar V..., ..l would be willing. Mr. Prime Minister, with all due respect, you will have to force us. Or at least try. Captain, you must do something. Call your ship. Quite right, Prime Minister. Enterprise, prepare to beam the away team back. At your command, Captain. You can't leave us like this! I know all I need for my report. Your prisoner's been returned to you. It's your decision, to try and force them back or welcome them home. In your own words, this isn't our affair. We cannot interfere in the natural course of your society's development. I'd say it's going to develop significantly in the next few minutes. It's been an interesting visit. When you're ready for membership the Federation will reconsider your application. Mr. Riker, four to beam up. Aye, sir. Success, Captain? Number One, will you note in our report that if the government of Angosia survives the night, we'll assist them in their efforts to reprogram their veterans. If the government doesn't survive? I've a feeling they will choose to. Mr. Crusher, set coordinates for Starbase Lya III. Coordinates set, sir. Engage. "
S3E12,"Captain's log, stardate 43510. 7. The Enterprise is delivering medical supplies to Rutia IV, following an outbreak of violent protests. Although non-aligned, the planet has long traded with the Federation. Now, peace has ended with terrorist attacks by Ansata separatists, demanding autonomy for their homeland on the western continent. Shore leave has been prohibited and all away teams have been instructed to beam down armed. Only a few minutes before our next meeting. Alright. We're finished. Waiter? Doctor! Keep back! Put that away, I'm a doctor. Lie still. Try not to move. I need bandages, disinfectant, something with alcohol in. It is not safe. That's an order. Don't worry. There's a lot of blood but it's not as bad as it looks. The Klingon's right. These Ansata are madmen. There could be another bomb. Clear this area. It would be prudent to return to the Enterprise. There are physicians on this planet. Who are not here. I am. Doctor. Thank you. Thank you. Not at all, Doctor. Captain, there has been an incident. A bomb has been detonated by Ansata terrorists. Your security status? Vulnerable, sir. Transporter room three, prepare to beam the away team back. I recommended that, but Dr Crusher insists on attending to the wounded. I understand. Picard to Dr Crusher. Go ahead. Data has told me of your situation. I know what you're going to say. At least allow me... The longer we argue, the longer I'll be. You are endangering your team. I'm trying to revive a wounded body with sleight of hand. I'm staying. Data and Worf don't have to stay. Crusher out. Transporter room, do you have a lock on them? Aye, sir. Shall I transport them? I don't want to be in the transporter room to greet her. Cmdr Data, hold your position until Rutian medics arrive. Aye, sir. The tricorder is not reading any other explosives in the vicinity. Get out of the way! You don't understand. I'm a... Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... to seek out new life and new civilizations,... to boldly go where no one has gone before. A transporter leaves residual ionisation. Our readings found no trace after the incident. People don't disappear. There must be a way to track her. Her communicator gives no signal. Either it is deactivated or she is in a shielded location. Why her? Sir, I believe she was the target of the abduction. Why take a Federation hostage? Their fight doesn't involve us. It does now. You hungry? You want something to eat? Doesn't matter to me. You want to be hungry, fine. What's your name? You're a doctor on a Federation starship. I always wondered what it would be like to travel across the galaxy. It's not something I've exactly had time for. This isn't the best way to meet new people, is it? If you need anything, ask for me. My name is Kyril Finn. They know me. We have no reason to believe she's been hurt. In fact, it's likely they will take good care of her, to use her as a bargaining chip. Bargaining chip? The innocent often become pawns in conflicts of this type. The Ansata separatists have been trying for generations to be free from the eastern continent. If they get the government just to acknowledge their demands, kidnapping your mother has worked. That's what they may be after. But it may not. Frankly, I don't care. My concern is your mother. Shortly we shall be meeting the authorities. Permission to be on the away team. No. You have an important job here. If we are to free your mother, we must trace the terrorists' movements. I want you on the team investigating this new technology of theirs. I understand. Report to Mr. Data. Dismissed. He needs your strength right now. History has shown us that strength may be useless when faced with terrorism. What exactly is Ansata policy with regard to hostages? I doubt if they have one. They don't usually take hostages. These are not people we're dealing with, but animals. Fanatics who kill without remorse or conscience, who think nothing of murdering the innocent. But they could easily have shot her where she stood. Don't ask me to explain them. I can't. The atrocities I've seen... This new device makes them even more deadly. How do I combat an enemy that fails to register on any scanner until they're literally in front of you, pointing a phaser at you? What do you know of this device? Not much, really. They first used it two months ago. We took these off dead terrorists. Our people have looked at them. Nothing they can explain. Mind if we take one to study? Not at all. I'll put you in touch with our research people. Appreciate your help. Perhaps if we were in possession of some advanced Federation weaponry, it would shift the balance of power back to us. You know that is out of the question. Yes. Of course. May I leave Cmdr Riker here to assist your search for Dr Crusher? If you like. You don't sound very optimistic. I know my enemy. They leave little room for optimism. You hungry? You want something to eat? Relax. Relax. I'm just going to... Now eat something. What's the point of not eating? You're the only one who suffers. Do you think it's bothering me? OK, it's bothering me. Come on. No fork, sorry. Did I mention my name is Finn? And you're...? Why have you brought me here? I need a doctor. There are doctors on Rutia. I need somebody better. You are with the Federation flagship, so you have to be. Who told you that? I heard. Now you'll help me just like you helped them. What are you talking about? You carry medical supplies for them, for the other side. Why does the Federation ally itself with the Rutians? We don't. We just brought them... Medical supplies. People were hurt. I know. I hurt them. You've finished eating. Get up. Get up! I have a son. You'll be with him again, Doctor. I see no reason to kill you. I need instruments from my ship to diagnose this. If I let you contact your ship, will they transport the instruments? Once my captain knows the situation, he'll agree. We are not allied with the Rutians. We're here on an errand of mercy. And since the Federation does not take sides, they will send the supplies? Absolutely. I've anticipated your needs. These are Federation supplies. The ones we had delivered to the medical dispensary. I heard. All these people belong to the Ansata? No. We suspect the organization itself only has some 200 members. There are over 5,000 names on this list, citizens we know to be sympathetic to their cause. They pass along weaponry and information, join pro-Ansata demonstrations, participate in strikes, the odd riot. How did this ever get started? 70 years ago we denied them independence. That gave them a noble cause. Now it's just an excuse for violence. You hate them as much as they hate you. I always considered myself moderate. What changed your mind? Being here for six months, watching the body count grow. Three assassination attempts on me. That'll change your point of view. The event that really opened my eyes took place only a few days after my arrival. A bomb destroyed a shuttle bus. 60 schoolchildren. There were no survivors. The Ansata claimed that it was a mistake, that their intended target was a police transport. As if that made everything alright. That day I vowed to put an end to terrorism in this city. And I will. Thank you. You're very helpful. You could learn to do this when you grow up. If you grow up. They're dying. I'm seeing a complicated set of conditions. Their DNA is warped somehow. It's distorting their entire cellular chemistry. You can't do anything? I can make them more comfortable. That's all. The damage is too extensive. If I could detect their condition earlier... You could reverse the damage? Perhaps. I don't know. What happened to them? It's the inverter. It's given our cause a new life, but... ..it asks for our lives in return. What does it do? We transport through a dimensional shift the Rutian sensors can't trace. Dimensional shifting?! You can't! Not with humanoid tissue. There are risks, the designers told us. But... it works. You also show distorted readings. Not as severe as the others, but... It doesn't matter. It does if it kills you. Don't you know? A dead martyr is worth ten posturing leaders. A subspace field coil with an isolated power source. Curious. Hey, guys. Come here. Look at this. The Rutians picked up a faint nuclear vibration during the terrorist movements. Nuclear vibration?! Possibly a subspace transition rebound during transport. Wait a minute. May l? Computer, call up the files on... What was his name? We studied him in astrophysics. Folded-space transport... Adaptive transport? Yes. The Elway Theorem? Yes. The Elway Theorem. What if it's interdimensional travel? The Elway Theorem was inaccurate. Research ended in the 23rd century. The nuclear vibrations match and Elway used a similar model. It would certainly be untraceable by standard methods. It was proven to be fatal. To use this technology would be irrational. These may be irrational people. Could we trace this? With an adaptive subspace echogram, maybe. It would cause significant internal damage that could be detected. Sounds as though they may require the services... of a doctor. Excuse me. This way. This is no way to live. For us or them? For both of you. It's not pretty, but this is what terrorism does to a city. There's got to be a better way to deal with it. My methods may seem harsh. They're gentle compared to my predecessors. Suspects would arrive at headquarters and mysteriously vanish. I put a stop to that. What happened to your predecessors? They were murdered. So, even that little boy's a threat? It's possible. That shuttle bus I told you about? The bomb was set by a teenager. In a world where children blow up children, everyone's a threat. It's OK. Over there. You should be drawing, not killing people. I can do both. How can you have such a casual attitude toward killing? I take my killing very seriously, Doctor. You are an idealist. I live in an ideal culture. There's no need for this violence, we've proven that. Your origins on Earth are from the American continent, are they not? North America. I know your history. This is a war for independence and I am no different than your own George Washington. Washington was a military general, not a terrorist. The difference between generals and terrorists is that between winners and losers. Win and you're a general. Lose... You are killing innocent people! Can't you see the immorality of it? Or have you killed so much you've become blind to it? How much innocent blood was spilled for the freedom of your Federation? How many good and noble societies have bombed civilians in war, wiped out whole cities? Now you enjoy the comfort that's come from their battles and killing, you frown on my immorality?! I'm willing to die for my freedom, Doctor. And in the finest tradition of your own great civilization, I'm willing to kill for it, too. Alright. You can go. Next! I could be more persuasive. No. Katik Shaw, waiter at the Lumar Café. You witnessed the explosion and the kidnapping. I saw nothing. You have ties to the Ansata. You may have set the bomb yourself. Where is she? What are you talking about? I've had enough of this. Take a message back to your people. We will negotiate for the release of Dr Crusher. Riker! She's a Starfleet officer. She's my responsibility. Your people have terms. We'll listen. We want her back. It's that simple. We don't need to detain this gentleman any longer. Get out. I should have him followed. But we'll try it your way. Is that what you want? What I want... ..is to go home. Back to my own country. To leave behind the round-ups, interrogations, bodies in the street. To be able to walk without bodyguards, not to have to jump at every sudden noise. That's what I want, Riker! A dimensional jump can create subspace pressure modulation. A magnetosphere echogram will monitor their movements and may collect enough data to trace their power source. How many jumps would that take? Dimensional shifting is so unstable, sir, I cannot say. Sir? I find it hard to understand many aspects of Ansata conduct. Their behaviour would be defined by my program as unnecessary and unacceptable. By my ""program"" as well, Data. But, if that is so, why are their methods so often successful? I have reviewed the history of armed rebellion. It appears terrorism is effective in promoting political change. It can be. But I don't believe that political power flows from the barrel of a gun. Yet there are numerous examples when it was successful. The independence of Mexico from Spain, the Irish unification of 2024 and the Kensey Rebellion. Yes, I am aware of them. Then would it be accurate to say that terrorism is acceptable when all options for a peaceful settlement have been foreclosed? These are questions that mankind has always struggled with. Your confusion is... only human. Finn, everyone is being rounded up. Because of her? The Federation wants to negotiate. While the Rutian police fill up the detention cells. A Starfleet officer is working with the director. He wants to meet you. I'm sure he does. Your Federation colleagues have engineered mass arrests to pressure me into releasing you. You've misunderstood. They're working with the police. All they want is to get me back. I'm not releasing you. I need you here. To find a way to reverse the effects of the dimensional shift? I can do that right now. Stop using it! I have a life, Finn. I have a son who needs me. Is your son on the ship? Yes. I'm sorry he's on the ship. No. They joined the Rutians against us. We are not your enemy. They are more valuable than an enemy. For 70 years we have shouted and no one has heard us. Destroy your ship, someone will listen. Please. It is they who interfered, sent medical supplies, organized mass arrests. They are killing your son, not me. Please, Finn, don't do this. I will do anything you ask. I had a son, too. He was 1 3 when he died in detention. What...? Intruder alert, deck 1 2. Another dimensional shift, sir. Go to red alert. Security to Engineering! Intruders in Engineering. Casualties on deck 1 2. Seal all decks. Lock transporters on to intruder signals. Intruder signals unstable. I cannot lock on. They are moving interdimensionally. There is no way to contain them. Explosive on the main warp chamber. Transporter room three, lock on to the explosive and energize. It's scrambling the sensors. I can't. Begin emergency evacuation. Mr. La Forge, can you remove the charge? I'll try. They've got it... locked on somehow. Stand by. Transporter room, lock on my signal and stand by to transport two kilometres off to starboard. His signal?! Now! Mr. La Forge, report. Transport complete, Captain. I have a man down. More dimensional shifts, sir. Can you calibrate a destination? No. The readings... Security! Code one emergency. Security! Lt Worf is in sickbay. The wound was not severe. Dead? Injured? Three dead, four wounded. Another millisecond, we'd have been a dust cloud instead of the Enterprise. Why? I just asked if they would talk. You have your answer, Riker. Sir, the next time the Ansata do a dimensional jump, we'll get a fix on the power source. Worf went down. He may not be alive. And there were other casualties. Was Wes on the bridge? Yes. He took cover. I didn't see any more than that. You are alright, though? Yes, they needed a doctor. The side-effects of the transport? Yes. We're closer to tracing their movements. It was Wesley who put us on to their dimensional jump. He has been extraordinary, Beverly. He'll make a very fine officer. He's had good role models. I'm sorry. If I'd only gone back to the ship... I should have beamed you up. You wouldn't dare. I would. And should. Without my permission? If you don't follow orders... If they're reasonable, I obey. Doctor, I will judge what is reasonable! There aren't any exits to the surface. So the only way out is by the transporter. Or the dimensional jump. A mode of travel I'd encourage you to avoid. It's killing them. They're mad. I don't know. The difference between a madman and a committed man willing to die for a cause... It's all become blurred over the last few days. I don't have to remind you of the mental impact of being a hostage. I know. I understand that. But their leader, Finn, he's not what you'd expect. No, he's certainly not. Without cause or reason, he and his outlaws attacked my ship! But he did have reasons. The medical supplies, the arrests. If we really examined our role in this... Beverly, you defend a man who may have murdered your son? I didn't kill your son, Beverly. We weren't able to destroy the ship. We had to settle for him. She wouldn't even tell me her name. I call her ""Doctor"". You have made a grave miscalculation. You assaulted a Federation starship, killed and wounded several crew, kidnapped two of her officers... ..and you don't expect a response? On the contrary, I count on it. You want Federation involvement? Captain, the Federation has a lot to admire in it, but there's moral cowardice in your dealings with non-aligned planets. You're doing business with a government that is crushing us and you say you're not involved? You're very, very much involved. You just don't want to get dirty. You accuse us of cowardice while you plant bombs in shadows? I am fighting the only war that I can against an intractable enemy. Now I'm fighting a big war against a more powerful adversary. Can't you see how that helps me? I'm afraid I can't. He's added a chair to the negotiating table. You added the chair. I am simply forcing you to sit in it. The Federation will tire of our little war. They'll want you back. They will want to get as far from Rutia as they can. I will not make it easy. Eventually the Federation will force the government into concessions. And then a few more, and then a few more. Until we can finally reach an honourable agreement that saves face for all sides. Except... we win. You understand I will not cooperate with you in any way. You've already cooperated, Captain,... ..just by coming here. I am not here to hurt you. Just hear what I have to say. Your people are safe. How long they stay that way depends on you. We demand an embargo and trade sanctions against Rutia. The Federation will blockade the planet. No ships will be allowed in or out. This will continue until our government agrees to talks mediated by a Federation council. You have 1 2 hours to decide. Got it. The Ansata base is 300 km from the city, in the south of the continent. It is located 30 metres below ground, implying a cavern-like dwelling. Any passages to the surface? Our readings show no evidence of any. Any light they have must be artificially generated. If we can shut it down, you could use the confusion to find your people. Request permission to join the rescue party, sir. I owe it to the Captain. Permission granted. You have the bridge, Mr. Data. Commander... Good luck. We'll bring her home, Wes. You're glad to see your captain. Yes. I may have to kill him. I just wanted to warn you. He can help. He's very influential. He will not help us. If you could just convince him... You may be able to, perhaps. Not l. I've talked to him. I'll try. If our places were reversed,... ..l would expect to die. Your places would never be reversed! He would never abduct you or play games with your life! He'd treat you with respect! I treated you with that. You've scared the hell out of me! It's the way you've tried to control this whole continent. You haven't tasted real fear yet. Is that the best you can do? Is fear the only weapon you have? No, but it's a good one. You know what scares me the most, Finn? It scares me to think you might win this fight and gain real power. Doctor... I... I don't want you to fear me. Generator's right over there. Beverly, how dangerous is another ride through the inverter? I don't know. But I don't want you to think about... We are obliged to think of escape. He's prepared to kill you! An excellent reason to escape. Have you gained his confidence? Indeed you have! And more. This might be of advantage to us. Jean-Luc... There are some things I want to tell you in case we don't get out of this. Have they found us? Do we have any emergency power? Freeze! Hold it right there! Hands up. Hands up, let's go. Finn... He's dead. You didn't have to kill him. As a prisoner he would have been a focus for violence as his followers tried to free him. Now he's a martyr. But the death toll might go down, at least in the short term. It's an imperfect solution for an imperfect world. Riker! No more killing. Already another one to take his place. It never ends. He could have killed you. He didn't. Maybe the end begins when one boy puts down his gun. I hear I owe my rescue to you. I was just part of the team. It's good to have you back. Both of you, sir. Take us out of orbit, Mr. Crusher. At your convenience! "
S3E13,"Captain's log, stardate 43539.1. We are orbiting around Bre'el IV. Its emergency centre is helping us investigate the catastrophic threat to the population from a descending asteroidal moon. The satellite's trajectory is deteriorating. This orbit will put it within 500 km of the surface. Atmospheric drag will bring it down on the next orbit. Have you found any explanation for this? No, Doctor. It is a most unusual phenomenon. Won't the moon disintegrate? No. It has a ferrous structure. It will be able to withstand tidal forces. Could we blow it into pieces? The total mass of the moon would remain the same. Fragments would spread destruction over an even wider area. How long before impact? 29 hours. Somewhere in the west. That would destroy an area 800 km in radius. That damage would be insignificant compared to the seismic repercussions, massive land quakes and tsunami. The resulting cloud of dust round the planet would cause a temperature reduction. It could be our own Ice Age. Mr. La Forge, could the Enterprise coax that satellite back where it belongs? We'd need a Delta-V of 4 km per second. Even with warp power, it'd mean exceeding the recommended engine output by 47 percent. It'd be like an ant pushing a tricycle. A slim chance. Given the choice between slim and none, I'll take slim. Make it so. Lt Worf, contact all ships to rendezvous and join us in this. We'll advise you of our progress. Can you give us any more, Geordi? We'd burn out the emitter. We're already beyond the limit. Delta-V is 92 metres per second. The mass is too great. We are having a negligible effect. What is that? Unable to identify source. Impulse engines passing safety limits. We're seconds from shutdown. Reduce power. Tractor beam off. Lt Worf, what the hell do the sensors say? The sound is not registering. Q. Red alert. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, supplemental. We haven't found a solution to the moon's deteriorating orbit. But with the arrival of Q, we have a good idea of the cause. Our options? We've done everything. We need more time and more power. I'll see what rules I haven't broken. Keep me informed. We know you're behind this, Q. These aren't my colours. And what are you blathering about? What twisted pleasure does it give you to bring terror to their lives? Whose lives? The millions down there, watching their moon falling. I have no idea what you mean. I have a much more serious problem. I'm out of the Continuum. My superiors decided to punish me. And punish us, it would seem. They said I spread chaos. They stripped me of my powers. You don't believe me? Would I humiliate myself like this? If it served your purpose, yes. It's the truth. I stand before you defrocked. Condemned to be a member of this lowest of species. A normal, imperfect, lumpen human being. They made you human as part of your punishment? No, it was my request. I could have become a Markoffian sea lizard or a Belzoidian flea. Anything I wished, as long as it was mortal. Since I only had a second to mull, I chose this and asked to come here. Why? Because you're the closest thing I have to a friend, Jean-Luc. Sir, he is reading as fully human. Is there an echo in here? I am sensing an emotional presence. I would normally describe it as being terrified. How rude! What do you want, Q? Your compassion. Alright, sanctuary on this ship, dreary as it sounds to both of us. Return that moon to its orbit. I have no powers. Q the ordinary. Q the liar. Q the misanthrope. Q the miserable and desperate. What must I do to convince you? Die. Very clever, Worf. Eat any good books lately? Fine. You want to be treated as human? Absolutely. Alright. Mr. Worf. Throw him in the brig. Delighted, Captain. You can't do this to me, Jean-Luc. You will walk or I will carry you. Given the option, I'll walk. You've disappointed me, Jean-Luc. I'm claustrophobic! I never should have picked human. I knew it the moment I said it. A future in this shell! Forced to cover myself with fabric because of outdated human morality. To say nothing of being too hot or cold, growing feeble with age, losing my hair, catching a disease, being ticklish, sneezing, having an itch, a pimple, bad breath. Having to bathe. Too bad. Klingon. I should have said Klingon. In my heart of hearts, I am a Klingon, Worf. Sorry. I could not survive in confinement. This is cruel and unusual punishment. The universe has been my back yard. As a fellow Klingon, if you'd speak to the Captain for me, I would be eternally grateful, which doesn't mean as much as it used to. Be quiet! Or disappear back where you came from. I can't disappear, any more than you could win a beauty contest. If I were to ask a simple question, might you be able to answer without troubling your intellect? Ready? Here goes. Would I permit you to lock me away if I still had all my powers? You have fooled us too often. Perspicacity incarnate. Please don't tell me the story of the boy who cried Worf. Computer, activate force field. I demand to be let out of here. You will deactivate this cell immediately. Romulan! I should have said Romulan. That Klingon goat. The question is, what sort of jaded game is he up to this time? Maybe he'll take Bre'el IV to the brink and then pull the moon back. Or he may have nothing to do with it at all. You think Q is telling the truth? Unlikely. But we must proceed with our dilemma as if Q is powerless. While he watches us struggle. I don't see that we have a choice. Mr. Worf, hail the Bre'el IV science station. They're standing by. Yes, Capt Picard? Our first attempt to restore the moon to its orbit has failed. We have less than 25 hours before impact. Our Chief Engineer is working on the tractor beam. There is hope, but if you have an evacuation plan... We have started moving people from the coast. We are going to make another attempt soon. Picard out. Geordi is not at all optimistic. What the devil...? Data? Sensors are showing broadband emissions, including berthold rays. Lethal? No, Commander. Overall exposure is less than 75 rems, like a soft medical scan. I speculate we are being probed. By whom? Sensors cannot identify the origin. It seems to be coming from all around us. You've come to apologise. How nice. All's forgiven. No offence taken. Enough. What is going on? How can I know what's going on? I've been in this dungeon of yours, alone, helpless, bored to tears. We have a moon inexplicably falling out of orbit and just now the ship was probed with radiation. I wasn't aware of this. Truthfully, Jean-Luc. I have been preoccupied by a frightening experience of my own. A couple of hours ago, I realized that my body was no longer functioning properly. I felt weak. I could no longer stand. Life oozed out of me. I lost consciousness. You fell asleep. Terrifying. How can you stand it day after day? You get used to it. What other dangers await me? I'm not prepared. I need guidance. Q, if you want to continue this charade, you can do it alone. Jean-Luc, wait! This is getting on my nerves, now that I have them. You have a moon in a deteriorating orbit. I've known lots of moons. Big ones, small ones. I'm an expert. I could help you, if you let me out of here. There are millions of lives at risk. If you have the power... I don't have any powers. But I have the knowledge, locked up in this puny brain. You cannot afford to not take that advantage, can you? Mr. Data, report to detention cell three. On my way, sir. Computer, remove the force field. If you are human, which I doubt, you'll have to work hard to earn our trust. I'm not worried about that. You only dislike me. Others in the cosmos truly despise me. Mr. Data, you are assigned to Q for the remainder of his stay. Escort him to Mr. La Forge in Engineering. Aye, sir. Can I have a Starfleet uniform? What are you looking at? I was considering the possibility of you telling the truth, that you really are human. It's the ghastly truth. I can stub my toe with the best of them. An irony. You have achieved in disgrace what I have always aspired to be. Humans are such commonplace creatures. They search the galaxy for something, they know not what. They have an enduring desire for knowledge and self-improvement. There's room for that. But they're a minor species in the grand scheme, not worth your envy. I do not feel envy. That's good. I feel nothing at all. That is part of my dilemma. I have their curiosity, but there are things I will never know. What it is like to laugh, or cry. Or to experience any emotions. If you ask me, these emotions are not what they're cracked up to be. The moon will hit its perigee in 1 0 hours. We can match its trajectory and apply continuous warp-equivalent power nine to the tractor beam. We can push it for nearly seven hours and that just might do it. But there's a problem. We will be too close to the atmosphere. That's the problem. This is incredible. See something, Q? I think I just hurt my back. I'm feeling pain. I don't like it. What's the right thing to say? I can't straighten up. Medical assistance to Engineering. People on Bre'el IV will be hurt... Yes. Your plan will not only destroy the moon, but your ship, too. Got a better idea? I'd begin by examining the cause, not the symptom. We've done that. There's no way... A large celestial object must have passed through at right angles to the plane of the star system. Probably a black hole. Can we counter the effect? Change the gravitational constant of the universe. What? Change the gravitational constant, so altering the mass of the asteroid. Redefine gravity? How? You just do it. Where's that Doctor, anyway? He means that changing gravity is beyond our capabilities. Well, in that case, never mind. Dr Crusher, Starfleet has shipped you back into exile. Q says he has hurt his back. If I didn't see it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it. He has classic back trauma. Muscle spasms. I've been under pressure. Family problems. Don't expect sympathy from me. You've been a pain in our backside often enough. Your bedside manner is admirable. I'm sure your patients recover quickly, just to get away from you. You know, this might work. We could wrap a low-level warp field around the moon to reduce its gravitational constant. Make it easier to push. Glad I could help. I think... Now what? Something's wrong with my stomach. It hurts? It's making noises. Maybe you're hungry. I've never eaten before. What do I ask for? The choice depends on individual taste. What do you like? Although I do not require sustenance, I sometimes ingest semi-organic nutrient in a silicon-based liquid. Is it good? It is good for me. It lubricates my bio-functions. That's not appealing. What else is there? A wide variety of items. The replicator can make anything you desire. How do I know what I desire? I have observed that the selection of food is influenced by the mood of the person ordering. I'm in a dreadful mood. Get me something appropriate. When Counsellor Troi is unhappy, she usually eats something chocolate. Chocolate? A chocolate sundae, for example. I do not speak from personal experience, but I have seen it have a profound psychological impact. I'll have ten chocolate sundaes. Ten? I have never seen anyone eat ten sundaes. I'm in a really bad mood and since I've never eaten before, I should be very hungry. This is not a moment I've been looking forward to. I hear they drummed you out of the Continuum. I like to think of it as a significant career change. Just one of the boys? A boy with an IQ of 2,005. The Captain and many of the crew are not convinced he is human. Really? Seems human enough to me. This is a dangerous creature. Why Picard would make her a member of the crew and not me... How terribly frightening for you, to be defenceless after all those centuries of being omnipotent. I still have friends in high places. Frightening one race after the other, teasing them like frightened animals, enjoying every moment of your victims' fears. From now on, I'll do missionary work, OK? That would be a noble cause, Q. You could learn from this one. Sure, the robot humanities teacher. I am an android, not a robot. I beg your pardon. I'd enjoy that. Get used to it. What? Begging. You're a pitiful excuse for a human. You'll only survive on charity. I'm not hungry. Sensors are picking up a cloud of energetic plasma. Bearing 341 , mark 20. Range, 12 km and closing. On screen. Energy patterns are reading as highly organized. A life form? Attempt to make contact, Mr. Worf. Receiving a signal, sir. On speaker. Computer, analyze signal. Patterns indicate intelligence. Unable to derive necessary referents to establish translation matrix. What's that? I don't know. Calamarain. Captain, a field of energetic tachyons is penetrating the hull. Location, deck ten, forward. Red alert. Geordi, increase shield power. Increasing by 20 percent. No effect. Increasing to 40 percent. Still no effect. Adjusting shield harmonics, diverting power to forward grids. The added harmonics are blocking the tachyon field. Help me! Somebody help me! How the mighty have fallen. Captain's log, supplemental. We have sustained light damage from an attack by the Calamarain. They apparently have a grievance with Q. No doubt one of many life forms that do. The Calamarain are not very hospitable. They exist as swirls of ionised gas. What did you do to them, Q? Nothing bizarre, nothing grotesque. You tormented them. A subjective term. One creature's torment is another's delight. They have no sense of humour, a flaw with which you can identify. I say we turn him over to them. I take it back. You do have a sense of humour. A dreadful one. I'm serious. Of course. You knew this would happen. One can never anticipate the Calamarain. Very intelligent, but flighty. Yes, but you must have so many enemies. You knew that once you became mortal, some of them might look you up. It had occurred to me. And for all your protestations of friendship, your real reason for being here is protection. You're very smart, Jean-Luc, but I know human beings. They're sopping over with compassion and forgiveness. They can't wait to absolve almost any offence. It's an inherent weakness. No, it is a strength. Call it what you will, but you'll protect me, even though I've tormented you. Fighting off all your enemies is not the mission I signed up for. Indeed. Human or not, I want no part of you. We will deposit you at the first starbase. But I could be a valuable member of the team. I'm human. I can learn. He has provided guidance for the analysis of the Bre'el satellite. It seems you have an advocate, Q. I am merely stating a fact. Mr. La Forge, your status? My program should extend the forward lobe of the warp field. I'm attempting to modify the field coils' alignment parameters. Maintaining integrity will be difficult. We can do it manually. The moon reaches its perigee in 1 4 minutes. Mr. Data, escort Q to Engineering. You will assist Mr. La Forge. Mr. Worf, hail the Bre'el IV science station. Aye, sir. Picard thinks I can't cut it on his starship. I can do anything his trained minions can do. Your skills are not in doubt. The Captain is merely concerned with your ability to successfully interact with his trained minions. Human relationships are complex. Your experience may not have adequately prepared you. I'm not interested in relationships. I want to prove I'm indispensable. Engineering. To function aboard a starship or in any human activity, you must form relationships. It's so hard. Of more importance is your ability to work in groups. I'm not good in groups. It's difficult to work in a group when you're omnipotent. The tides reached ten metres and are beginning to swell again. We have a lot of frightened people down here. The moon is nearing its perigee. We are preparing to make our attempt. Our population has taken shelter, but it will not be adequate if you fail, especially for those on the western continent. Whatever the results, we know you've done your best, Picard. It's appreciated. We'll keep you advised, Doctor. Sensors are picking up increased energy output from the Calamarain. La Forge to bridge. The moon has reached its minimum orbital distance. It's time. We'll have to lower shields. Proceed. Mr. Worf, keep a close eye on Q's friends out there. Understood. Right, this is what we will do. Everybody already knows what to do except for you. Here's what I need... My knowledge far exceeds yours by about a billion times. So, step aside gracefully. Your experience would be most valuable if you control the field integrity. That would be a waste of my talents. Get to the controls or get out of here. Data, you're my liaison to the bridge. Stay with me. Who does he think he is, giving me orders? Geordi thinks he is in command here. And he is correct. Engineering, holding at 640 metres. Fields to flight tolerance. Warp core to 90 percent. Engage field coils. Tractor beam to stand by. Field output? Field output? 21 7. Impulse engines to full. Ready to engage tractor beam. Lowering shields. Engage tractor beam. Extending warp field forward. Is that the forward limit? Yes. We can't encompass the entire moon. Should we proceed? The two parts of the moon will have different densities. Stand by. I can adjust the field symmetry to compensate. I doubt it. You don't know what this ship can do. I still believe it will work. Increasing power to warp field and tractor beam. If you're wrong, the moon will crumble. Shut up, Q. I will not be spoken to in this manner. Data. Q, I strongly suggest that you cooperate. Inertial mass of the moon is decreasing to 2.5 million tonnes. It is working. We can move it. Firing impulse engines. Captain, the moon's trajectory has moved 0.3 percent... 0.4 percent. Emergency! Shields up. Disengage tractor beam. Calamarain attacking. Shields holding. Tachyon field repelled. The blast is pushing us into the upper atmosphere. Hull temperature rising. 2,000 degrees. 2,500. Moving to full power. Calamarain resuming attack. They've overpowered the shields at deck 36, Engineering. Can we get power to the shields? We need all the power we have to get out of the atmosphere. Try activating the integrity field. Yes, sir. It's not working. Harmonics on manual. Hull temperature falling. We're in the clear. Diverting power to forward sections. That charge nearly knocked out his positronic net. What can you do? Reset the motor pathways, recouple the autonomic nodes. There's pressure in his fluidic systems. Thermal shock. If he was mortal, he'd be dead. Let's not overstate the matter here. I'm mortal and I survived. The cheers are overwhelming. You exceed your own standards of self-preoccupation. He may have saved your life. He's strong. He'll survive. Osmotic pressure still rising. Maybe we can bypass the regulator. It would be helpful if everybody got out of here. Stay with Q. Geordi? The moon's trajectory? We only bought another orbit. We can try again at the next perigee. And the Calamarain will go after Q. Commander, he's not worth it. Come. You're right, I'm extraordinarily selfish. But it has served me so well in the past. It will not serve you here. Don't be so hard on me, Jean-Luc. You've always been mortal. You know about dying. I've never given it a second thought. Or a first one, for that matter. I could have been killed. If it hadn't been for Data creating that delay, I would have been gone. No more me. And no one would have missed me, would they? Data may have sacrificed himself for me. Why? That is his special nature. He learned the lessons of humanity well. When I ask myself if I would have done the same for him, and I am forced to answer no, I feel... I feel ashamed. Q, I'm not your father confessor. You will receive no absolution from me. You've brought us nothing but pain. And I'm still not convinced that all this isn't your latest attempt at a puerile joke. It is a joke. On me. The joke of the universe. The king who would be man. As I learn more and more what it is to be human, I am more and more convinced that I would never make a good one. Without my powers, I am frightened of everything. I'm a coward. And I'm miserable. And I can't go on this way. He's going to be alright. We're recalibrating his circuits. He can't talk yet. There are creatures in the universe who would consider you the ultimate achievement, android. No feelings, no emotions, no pain. And yet you covet those qualities of humanity. Believe me, you're missing nothing. But if it means anything to you, you're a better human than l. Where's the main shuttle bay? Located on deck four. Take me there. Captain, an unscheduled shuttle has just been launched. On main viewer. Hailing frequency. Frequencies open. Shuttle occupant, identify yourself. Don't try and talk me out of it. Return to the ship. I can't get used to following orders. Captain, the plasma cloud is moving toward the shuttle. It's easier this way. They won't bother you after I'm gone. Engineering, extend shields. Don't use your tired cliché of charging to the rescue just in the nick of time. I don't want to be rescued. As a human being, I have been a dismal failure. Perhaps my death will have dignity. Q, there is no dignity in suicide. Yes, you're right. Death of a coward, then. So be it. But as a human, I would have died of boredom. This goes against my better judgement. Transporter room three, beam shuttle one back to its bay. Aye, Captain. It's a perfectly good shuttlecraft. Unable to transport. I can't lock on to the shuttlecraft. Interference from the Calamarain? No, but they are following him. Extend shields around shuttle one. Extending shields. Commander, the shields are frozen. Cause? Unknown. Lock on tractor beam. Not functioning either. What the hell is going on? Not bad, Q. Not great. But not bad. Q! Sacrificing yourself for humans? Do I detect a little selfless act? You flatter me. I was only trying to put a quick end to a miserable existence. What a dreadful colour. Yeah. What are you doing here? I've been keeping track of you. I knew you'd be in my corner. No, I got you kicked out. You're a lost cause, Q. Whichever solar system I go to, I have to apologise for you. And I'm tired of it. I wasn't the one who misplaced the Deltived Asteroid Belt. This isn't about me. I've got better places to be. But somebody had to make sure you still didn't cause trouble. Even as a member of this... limited species. Well, I hope I've been entertaining you. Barely. But I find these humans interesting. I understand what you see in them. After all you've done, they still want to keep you safe. A weakness of the race. And they're still at it! They just tried to beam you up, back, whatever it is they call it. Really? I stopped them. If the Calamarain finish me off, you can be back on your way. They're on hold, too. There's still this matter of the selfless act. The Calamarain would have destroyed the Enterprise to get to you. That's really why you left, right? It was a teeny bit selfless. There's my problem! I can't tell the Continuum you committed a selfless act. There'd be questions and explanations for centuries. I've learned my lesson. Remember who you're talking to. All-knowing, all-seeing. Fine, you got your powers back. Try and stay out of trouble. So, they wanted to destroy me, did they? If you think I tormented you in the past, wait until you see what I do with you now. Q? I was just seeing if you were still watching. Captain, the aliens have disappeared and so has the shuttle. Scan the sector. I have, sir. Well,... I suppose that is the end of Q. Au contraire, mon capitaine. He's back! I'm forgiven. My brothers and sisters of the Continuum have taken me back. I'm immortal again. Omnipotent again. Swell. Don't fret, Riker. My good fortune is your good fortune. I don't need your fantasy women. You're so stolid! You weren't before the beard. Very well. Q! But I feel like celebrating. I don't! Alright. All of it. At the risk of being rude... Yes, I've overstayed my welcome. As a human, I couldn't thank you. But as myself, you have my everlasting gratitude. Until next time. But, before I go, there is a debt I wish to repay to my professor of the humanities. Data, I've decided to give you something very, very special. If you intend to make me human... No, no. I would never curse you by making you human. Think of it as a going-away present. Data? Data, why are you laughing? I do not know. But it was a wonderful... feeling. Captain, Bre'el IV is hailing us. On screen. Capt Picard, you've done it. I'm sorry? The moon is back to its normal orbit. However you did it, thank you. Let's see it, Worf. Mr. Data, your analysis? The moon's altitude is 55,000 km. Orbit is circular. There is no further danger to the planet. Ensign, set course for Station Nigala IV. Aye, sir. Perhaps there's a residue of humanity in Q after all. Ensign. Don't bet on it, Picard. "
S3E14,"Captain, we have arrived at Tanuga IV. The away team has completed its survey of Dr Apgar's work. Good. Please. And feel free to examine the work of the other students, too. Ensign Williams' style is influenced by geometric constructivism. Lt Wright has fused the incongruities of the surrealists with the irrationality of Dadaism. Interesting. Thank you. In what way? While suggesting the free treatment of form attributed to Fauvism, this quite inappropriately attempts to juxtapose the disparate cubistic styles of Picasso and Léger. In addition, the use of colour suggests a... haphazard mélange of clashing styles. And the unsettling overtones... Thank you, Mr. Data! If I can further assist... No! Thank you. Captain's log, stardate 43610.4. After making a delivery of dicosilium to the Tanuga IV research station, our away team has received an update from Dr Nel Apgar on his efforts to make Krieger waves, a potentially valuable new power source. Welcome back, Mr. La Forge. Thank you, sir. Where's Cmdr Riker? He's still down on the station, sir. Dr Apgar wanted a word with him. Any problems? Not with the scientific part of the mission, no. Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave. Now. I'm sure Cmdr Riker will be able to explain. Stand by, Commander. Engaging transport. Transporter room to Engineering, I have a power drain. Transporter room! Is Cmdr Riker aboard? Not yet, Captain. I'm having trouble clearing the signal. Transporter room to bridge. He's aboard. Why do you sound so surprised? We weren't sure you left the space station in time. In time for what? It just exploded, sir. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, supplemental. Cmdr Riker has informed me that Dr Apgar was the only one aboard the space station when it exploded. We remain in orbit, investigating the accident. I've checked the whole system. I can't find any transporter malfunction to cause an explosion like that. Why the power drain beforehand? I don't know, sir. I shall want an answer to that. I'm sure the Tanugans will too. The radiation suggests an overload of the reactor core. Were there any indications of reactor core problems? No, sir. Number One? Mr. La Forge indicated that this was not an entirely routine mission. It's a long story, but I'm sure it has nothing to do with this accident. Chief Investigator Krag of Tanugan security requests permission to beam aboard. Granted. Escort him to the bridge. Aye, sir. You had better tell me as much as possible prior to his arrival. I'm Lt Worf, head of ship's security. I will take you to the captain. Chief Investigator, welcome. I'm Capt Picard. This is my first officer, Cmdr William Riker. Cmdr Riker, I am here to take you into custody. Custody? On what charge? Suspicion of murder. Wait a minute. You can't come on... We are willing to cooperate, but... Then release the prisoner for transportation to the planet. Let's continue this discussion in private. Number One... you have the bridge. Just what is the evidence against my officer? Two witnesses have described the commander's threats against Dr Apgar. Threats? I'm aware they had a private conversation. Apparently, it was much more than a private conversation. But he will be given a chance to prove his innocence. In our system of jurisprudence a man is innocent until proved guilty. In ours he is guilty until proved innocent and you are under our jurisdiction. If I understand Federation regulations on this, and I did look them up... I am aware of Federation regulations, sir. In them you will find the captain decides if extradition's warranted. Are you saying it is not? I am saying, if there is sufficient cause to warrant a trial I will release my officer into your custody. Would you say you are close to your first officer? That question is irrelevant. Really! You cannot believe that. How can I expect a fair and impartial decision? I must protect the rights of my officer. I can appreciate that. But you will do it on the planet, not here. After all, what if you were to decide to leave this star system? You have my word as a Starfleet officer that I will not. Unacceptable. Captain, you will turn him over to me for interrogation now! Interrogate him here. We must recreate, step by step, all the events leading to the explosion. We will require access to all the witnesses, as well as the data from the lab's ground computers. It would be impossible to accomplish here. Perhaps not. Mr. Data, will you report to my ready room? Aye, sir. We may be able to assist you in recreating these events. Cmdr Data, this is Chief Inspector Krag. By taking testimony from the away team and from witnesses provided by the investigator, could you program the holodeck to recreate events on the station? It would require construction and design specifications, full representations of the Krieger equipment, as well as visual images and voice analyses of the persons involved. But it is possible. Very well. Arrangements will be made to provide you with all available information. I shall return shortly with our witnesses. Commander, escort Investigator Krag to transporter room three. Ensign Crusher, Mr. La Forge, we are going to recreate the research station on the holodeck. I want you to work with Cmdr Data on the preparations. In addition, Cmdr La Forge and Cmdr Riker, I want you to give the computer depositions of everything you saw, everything you heard, while you were on board. Counsellor, I want you to assist me during this inquiry. My decision on the extradition will be based on the evidence presented during these recreations. Captain, may I have a word with you? Under the circumstances, Number One, I think that would be inappropriate. Second officer's log, stardate 4361 1.6. Programming of the holodeck has taken 18 hours 11 minutes and is complete. All participants have entered their depositions. Complete records from the lab's ground computers as well as Dr Apgar's personal logs have been included. The recreations will have a nominal 8. 7 percent margin of error. Is there anything you'd like to say before we begin? Just this. I'm not a murderer. I went to the lab as a representative of Starfleet. I acted accordingly. I was there to evaluate Dr Apgar's progress in the development of a Krieger-wave converter. That's all I was interested in. Computer, load deposition program Riker one. Run the simulation. Dr Apgar, I'm Cmdr William Riker. Lt Cmdr Geordi La Forge. My assistant, Tayna. Let's get on with it, shall we? Let's not be in such a hurry, dear. Perhaps our guests would care for refreshments. My wife, Manua. A pleasure to meet you. If you're ready to start, we are. Of course I am. Why not give me an overview while Mr. La Forge and your assistant look at the experimental data? Fine. I must say, Commander, I resent this early arrival. Starfleet will get its converter. I've had a few setbacks, that's all. We're not here to pressure you. We just want an update. Tayna, show Mr. La Forge whatever he wants to see. Give full access to our records. Yes, Doctor. If you'll come with me? Our lambda field generator requires a minimum of 5,000 kilometres... Darling, you're being rude. Cmdr Riker is willing to sit through all your prattle. Let's have a drink, Commander, and we'll hear all about Krieger waves. To your success, Doctor. And the rewards that come with it. Riker, what is Starfleet doing here anyway? My delivery wasn't due for another three months. We were in this sector anyway. As you'd asked for more dicosilium, it seemed like a good opportunity. How interesting. What is this other mission? It's a study of a proto-star cloud. The Enterprise will be back tomorrow. The Enterprise just left you here? We didn't want to inconvenience you. We arranged quarters. I won't hear of it. I insist you stay with us. I hardly think... I know you would prefer to be left alone with your very important work but l, for one, am glad for the company. Good. I must apologise for my husband's lack of social graces. He may be one of the great scientific minds of the galaxy, but he does come up a bit short in other areas. Wait a moment. Stop! Computer, freeze program. Then it's your testimony it was Mrs. Apgar's idea for you to spend the night aboard the space station? It's my testimony and it's the truth. Resume program. Our guest quarters aren't luxurious, but I've tried to make them warm. I'll be very comfortable, thank you. Good night. Environmental controls are here. I'm sure I'll find all I need. And the door shuts by touching this panel. Mrs. Apgar... This is my sanctuary. Privacy is very important on a small station. I'm left alone here. Often for hours. It's late. I am tired. Are you still tired? Ma'am... Excuse me. I really think you ought to leave. I knew I'd find you with him. Did you think I didn't notice how you looked at him? I'm not the fool you take me for. Doctor... ! This has been a terrible mistake! You won't get away with this. I'll see to it. I swear I will. Freeze program. I didn't see Dr Apgar until the next morning. He asked to see me alone. Cmdr La Forge returned to the Enterprise. Resume program. If I make a formal complaint your report on my work won't be very good. Doctor, this will have no impact on my report. It was a misunderstanding. We can straighten it all out if Mrs. Apgar joins us. My wife and my assistant have transported down to the planet. What will you put in your report? That there is no justification for the extra dicosilium I requested? That is why they sent you early, isn't it? I can explain why I needed it. They don't understand my problems. There are explanations for this. I don't need explanations. Then we have nothing further to say to each other. I'll tell my captain to expect your grievance. Do that. Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave. Now. Stand by, Commander. Engaging transport. Freeze program. Then I returned to the Enterprise. And you have nothing further to add? Nothing about firing a phaser? I never fired a phaser on the station. That's odd. Very odd. Capt Picard, is it not true your sensors detected an energy drain just as Cmdr Riker began transport? That's correct. Have you been able to explain it? Not to my knowledge. We have. Our readings are quite clear about it. Information from the lab's ground computers indicates that an energy pulse was fired just as Cmdr Riker began transport. Furthermore, by analyzing the angle and trajectory we determined that it came from the very spot Cmdr Riker was standing. So then, will you allow me to show you my recreation of the end of this story? A speculation, if you will. Computer, run hypothetical Krag one. Riker to Enterprise, I'm ready to leave. Now. Stand by, Commander. Engaging transport. Freeze program. Three seconds later, the space station exploded. He's right. Something was fired at the reactor core. The energy signature does indicate a phaser-like blast. It wasn't the commander's phaser! There's another answer. We're just not seeing it. Could anything else in the lab create this kind of energy discharge? Not that I saw. Besides, how could it come from Cmdr Riker's exact spot? I should have stayed with him! Commander... Sensors indicate a radiation burst on deck 39 outside cargo bay 1 2. Source? Unknown, sir. Computer, identify type of radiation. Emission is not consistent with any known radiation. It is subsiding, sir. What kind of radiation could do this? Make any sense to you? No. Not even the main deflector puts out that kind of spillage. Where's it from? I don't know, but whatever it is, it can put a hole in solid duranium! In a sense we have already met Mrs. Apgar, so we shall dispense with introductions. Mrs. Apgar, you understand the purpose of this hearing? We understand how difficult this will be for you. If you need a recess, please don't hesitate to ask. Would you like to make a statement before we begin? No. I just know he did it. He killed my husband. Computer, load Manua simulation one. Run program. If you greet them with such a long face they'll assume something is wrong with the experiment. I just need a little more time. I'm certain they'll give you all you need if you just show a little charm. You do that so much better than I do. Manua, some day I'll be able to reward you for all your patience. I'll get you everything you ever dreamed of. I have all the reward I need. Now go on. I'll be right in. Dr Apgar? Cmdr William Riker. Lt Cmdr Geordi La Forge. My assistant, Tayna. Let's get on with it, shall we? Don't be in such a hurry, dear. Our guests might like refreshment. My wife, Manua. A pleasure to meet you, Manua. I'm anxious to get started. If you wish. I resent your early arrival. I have much work to do. I'll try and make this as painless as possible for both of us. Do you assist your husband? No, I'm no scientist. No, neither am l. But I find this all fascinating. Mr. La Forge, take a look at the doctor's experimental data. Later you can give me an overview. Fine. Starfleet will get its converter. I've had a few setbacks, that's all. I'm not trying to pressure you. I'm sure my report will underscore the need to support your research. Tayna, I'll call up the records. Show the commander's assistant whatever he wants to see. Yes, Doctor. If you'll come with me? Our field generator on the planet requires a minimum of 5,000 km... Let Tayna take care of that. I'm sure Cmdr Riker wants to hear your report. I'll pour you both a drink and you can talk all about Krieger waves. Commander... To success! Success! Well, in a way I suppose it's good that you're early. It gives me a chance to show you the progress we've been making. I'd appreciate it if we could stay here until the Enterprise returns. It's a little inconvenient. It would help to accelerate the process. Well, if you wish, Commander. Now... Where shall I start? Well, first of all, you should know that I am very close to being able to columnate a Krieger field. Our guest quarters are modest. Very charming. It has your touch. We don't often have guests. I use this as my sanctuary. Who do you need sanctuary from? The environmental controls are here. Commander, please. It's late and I'm tired. A man more interested in Krieger waves than you! How is that possible? My husband is one of the greatest minds in the galaxy and we love each other very much. Please! Don't! It must be very lonely. A princess in a very high tower. My husband will be looking for me. Your sanctuary, remember? Commander, don't! She's lying! That never happened. Freeze program. Please! Captain, you know I would never act like that. Cmdr Riker! This isn't me. I didn't close the door. I didn't proposition her and I certainly didn't try to rape her. Why are you doing this? It's exactly what happened. Will, come on, sit down. Resume program. Please! I knew you'd try this. Do you think I didn't notice how you looked at her? I'm not the fool you take me for! You won't get away with this. Your career is over. I'll see to it, I swear I will. If you report this, you'll be making a terrible mistake, Doctor. Freeze program. Your career was safe. He was a scientist. In another day some more technical trivia would have distracted him. He would have forgotten about you and his complaint to Starfleet. Excuse me. We'll... we'll take a short recess. Why would she lie like that? She was lying. You could tell. Will, I didn't sense any deception from her. Then you think that l... No! Of course not. I know you. You don't have to convince me of anything. We can't both be telling the truth. It is the truth, as each of you remembers it. But her version puts a noose around my neck. This is healing beautifully. You can work on strengthening those muscles. Security to Dr Crusher. Evacuate. Repeat: evacuate. Radiation emissions are indicated in sickbay. This is definitely the same radiation that penetrated deck 39. Highly focused, very powerful, but of unknown origin. If this should happen near the engine core we'd be in big trouble, Captain. Do you have any theories? Data's noticed something too strange to be a coincidence. The two radiation events on board occurred five hours, twenty minutes and three seconds apart. The science station exploded at almost four times that interval. There's a .001 4 second variance we haven't been able to explain yet. So there's a connection between the radiation bursts and the blast? We do not have the evidence to support that conclusion at this time. If they're right, we should be able to predict the next event. We're expecting it in five hours. Take every precaution to protect the ship's vital areas. If we haven't found the source before the time is up, we'll leave orbit. If you perceive any further danger, advise me immediately. We'll figure it out, Commander. After the... fight, Dr Apgar came to find me. He was very upset. And he told you what happened? Yes, he told me everything that happened. Based on Tayna's deposition, we have recreated the incident as Dr Apgar described it to her. Computer... Inspector, this is hearsay. She wasn't a witness to this incident. But Dr Apgar is dead. Her statement is admissible in Tanugan law and I insist you consider it. Well... We'll watch this... evidence and we'll weigh it accordingly. Computer, run Tayna simulation three. I knew it. Do you think I didn't notice how you looked at each other? I'm not the fool you take me for. I'm going to report this, Riker. You can count on that. You're a dead man, Apgar. A dead man! Freeze program. And then Dr Apgar came to find you? Yes. Run Tayna simulation four. I want you to take Manua and beam down to Tanuga immediately. If he threatened you, you shouldn't stay. I'm not leaving him here. I've got to protect our work. I'll contact the authorities. No! I'll take care of that. Doctor, be careful. It'll be alright. Go on. Freeze program. Then what happened? I left the station with Manua. The next day, when I heard the station had exploded, I knew what had happened. He'd killed Dr Apgar! Thank you. You are excused. Captain, I have established motive, method and opportunity. In any court in the Federation that is sufficient to warrant the extradition of the accused. I await your decision forthwith. I don't see any alternative. Do you? We both know Will's innocent. Of course he's innocent! But I can't allow myself the luxury of yielding to personal feelings. The evidence warrants a trial. I'll have to allow extradition. Do you think there is enough evidence to prove his innocence? No. Captain, we have found the radiation source. Can you join us on the bridge? Acknowledged. We are looking for a phenomenon that reoccurs every five hours, twenty minutes and three seconds. The interval between bursts. We have found one such phenomenon on the planet. The field generator Apgar used during his research emits an energy pulse, then takes five hours, twenty minutes and three seconds to recharge. It must have been left on after the explosion. Why would a generator affect the Enterprise in this way? It should not be. It is a harmless lambda field generator. But we knew that somehow it was related to our radiation bursts. We now know what is causing the bursts and why the station exploded. And we also know who killed Dr Apgar. Chief Inspector, we've watched these events replayed over and over again and... I am impressed and admittedly dismayed by the body of evidence against Cmdr Riker. But isn't it remarkable that with all the witnesses, all the different points of view of the events aboard the space station, we haven't seen what really happened? I do not understand. Allow me, with the help of Mr. La Forge, to explain. Computer, load Manua program one, time index... ..1 4-4-1 . Play program. Starfleet will get its converter. I've had a few setbacks, that's all. Freeze. Mrs. Apgar, this is from your deposition. It suggests that your husband had failed to create Krieger waves. Yes, but he was very close. He said he needed more time. He was upset by our early arrival. But in fact I maintain that he had already made that breakthrough and that he was lying to us. On what basis? For several hours we've experienced unusual radiation bursts. We've identified them as Krieger waves. Krieger waves? But that's impossible. From where? Right here. Inside the holodeck. We have recreated your science lab in every detail. Essentially, what was in the original lab is here. Including the converter Dr Apgar claimed didn't work. Except it does. Your field generator has been sending out harmless energy charges, which this facsimile has been converting into Krieger waves. But the holodeck can't do that. Well, it didn't. When you get down to it, the converter is just a series of mirrors and reflective coils. Energy from the generator reflects off elements in the converter, which turns it into highly focused Krieger waves. And those waves have been striking different areas of our ship as we orbit the planet and our angle to the generator changes. Why would Dr Apgar lie about his success? Computer, run Manua program one, time index 1 4-3-8. Manua, some day I'll be able to reward you for all your patience. I'll get you everything you ever dreamed of. I have all the reward I need. Freeze program. Computer, run Riker program two, time index... ..1 6-1 -0. To your success, Doctor. And the rewards that come with it. Freeze. I never said that. Nevertheless, it seems clear that your husband was motivated to earn the rewards that pleased you. What's wrong with that? He wouldn't have earned great profits from Starfleet. We only wanted a new power source. But if he could turn this into a weapon, it would be worth a lot to the Romulans and a few others. The extra dicosilium Dr Apgar had been trying to order is an indication he was trying to create larger reflective coils. When the away team arrived early he must have been worried that Starfleet was becoming suspicious. He needed more time to finish his work. Apgar said that in all three versions. No doubt he was afraid Cmdr Riker might learn the truth... ..and cut off his support prematurely. Discovering Cmdr Riker with his wife didn't help matters. I submit he decided to murder Cmdr Riker. Ridiculous! Is it? Computer, run Tayna program four, time index... ..1 8-1 -4. I'll contact the authorities. No! I'll take care of that. Freeze. Tayna, what exactly is Apgar doing here? Activating the planet's generator. Why would he do that? Maybe he was going to work on the converter. I don't know. Maybe he was thinking ahead to his next confrontation with Cmdr Riker. Computer, play Riker program four, time index... ..24-1 . What will you put in your report? That there's no justification for the extra dicosilium? That is why they sent you early. I can explain why I needed it. They don't understand my problems. There are explanations. I don't need explanations. Freeze. It must have seemed Cmdr Riker was confirming Apgar's worst fears. And I believe it was now he finally decided to kill him. You forget. We know that the energy pulse which blew up the reactor originated from Cmdr Riker's position, not Dr Apgar's. We are hypothesising that Dr Apgar energized the converter at the moment of Cmdr Riker's beam-out, hoping to make his death look like an accident. But unexpectedly the energy pulse hit the transporter beam and reflected back to the reactor, which caused the explosion. An interesting hypothesis, but impossible to prove. Not really. We know the field generator has been repeating a discharge like clockwork, except the explosion occurred .001 4 seconds after the initial discharge. That variance is the time it would take the energy pulse to bounce from the transporter beam to the reactor. We've arranged a demonstration. Mr. La Forge, I think it's about time. Computer, load program La Forge one. Coordinate auto-engage time sequence. The next discharge is scheduled to occur in just a few moments. We've aligned the holodeck to recreate the final events as Cmdr Riker described them, only this time, our facsimile will process the energy charge from the planet and reflect it just as the original converter did before the explosion. If we're correct, we'll know it instantly. Auto-engage time sequence synchronized. Then we have nothing further to say to each other. I'll tell my captain to expect your grievance. Do that. Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave. Now. Stand by, Commander. Engaging transport. Dr Apgar killed himself during his attempt to kill Cmdr Riker. Based on this new evidence, I withdraw my request for Cmdr Riker's extradition. Commander... my apologies. Number One, have we any further business in the Tanuga system? Not that I know of. I'd gladly put it behind me. Then perhaps you would get this ship under way. With pleasure, sir. Ensign Crusher, set course for Emila II, warp three. Course laid in, sir. Engage. "

Nothing I have seen before. Is it a wormhole? Yes and no. Like a time displacement. But it has no discernible event horizon. Navigational subsystems are unable to give coordinates. Confirmed. The phenomenon has no definable centre or outer edge. You're saying it is and isn't there?! I have insufficient information to make an analysis as yet. The dynamics of the radiation... Captain! Something's happening. A new change in sensor readings. Mr. Data? Scanning sensors. Lieutenant, what are their sensor readings? Is that an enemy vessel? I'm getting too much interference, Captain. Now hear this. Fleet formation briefing in main war room at 1500 hours. This isn't right. It's changed. It's clearing now, Captain. Definitely Federation starship. Accessing registry. Looks like they had a rough ride. NCC... 1 701 ... ..C. USS... ..Enterprise. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Military log, combat date 43625.2. While investigating an unusual radiation anomaly, the Enterprise has encountered a ghost from its own past: the Enterprise-C, the immediate predecessor to this battleship. Sensors confirm design and specifications. Hull and engine materials conform to methods of that time period. But that cruiser was destroyed with all hands over 20 years ago. Presumed destroyed. It was last seen near the Klingon outpost Narendra III exactly 22 years, three months and four days ago. And now they're here. Has it been adrift for years or has it travelled through time? It is a possibility, Captain. If that hypothesis is correct, the phenomenon we have encountered is a temporal rift in space. A rift? Possibly a Kerr loop from superstring material. It would require a high-energy interaction in the area to be formed. It's certainly not stable. It could collapse at any time. Captain. I'm able to scan the interior of the ship now, sir. Damage to warp-field nacelles and hull-bearing struts. Internal space frame is... Life signs, Captain! Readings are sporadic. Massive casualties, but some are still alive. Bridge to sickbay. Emergency teams, stand by transporter rooms. Belay that order, Doctor. Respectfully... Regardless of where they came from, they are here now and need our help. If that ship travelled into the future, we could be dealing with variables that will alter the flow of history. Enterprise-C is sending out a distress call, sir. Audio only. This is Capt Garrett of the Starship Enterprise, to any Federation ship. We have been attacked by Romulan warships and require immediate assistance. We've lost warp drive. Life support is failing. There's no record of a Romulan assault on that ship. Voice message has ended, Captain. It's only an automated signal now. Open a hailing frequency. This is Capt Picard of the Federation... of a Federation starship. Stand by to receive emergency teams. We will handle this one step at a time. Stabilize their power, tend their injured, and avoid all discussions of where and when they are. Aye sir. Lieutenant... Message coming in from Starfleet monitor stations. Klingon battle ships approaching. Battle alert. Condition yellow. Aye, sir. Capt Garrett? Yes. I'm Cmdr William Riker. Our emergency teams are on board. Doctor? The rest of the bridge crew is dead. She has serious internal injuries. She must come back to the Enterprise. To where? We'll explain later. You'll explain now. We're from a Federation ship. We answered your call. Your ship is in good hands, but we need to get you to our sickbay. Very well. Crusher to transporter room. Two to beam directly to sickbay. Stand by for transport. It's pretty bad. Looks like they were in a hell of a fight. If you can't stabilize life-support, we'll have to evacuate the ship. I think I can do it. I'll have to get to Engineering. Damage control team Alpha, meet me on level three. Commander. Thanks. Cmdr William Riker. Lt Castillo, helmsman. Away team reporting in, Captain. On screen. Go ahead. We've stabilized life-support. Mr. La Forge is working on the main power couplings, but it'll take time. It's a real mess down here. Survivors? 125. Recommendations? I'd hate to scrap her. Starfleet could certainly use another ship, even if she is old. Agreed. But we can't stay in this area too long. If you get her under way in 9 hours we'll escort her to Starbase 1 05. If not... we'll evacuate the survivors and destroy the ship. Understood, sir. Keep me posted. Out. Guinan? We need to talk. Somehow this... this is all wrong. This is not the way it's supposed to be. How do you think things have changed? I look at things, people, and... they just don't feel right. What things? What people? You. Your uniform. The bridge... What's the matter with the bridge? It's not right! Nothing has changed. I know that. I also know it's wrong. What else? Families. There should be children on board. What? Children on the Enterprise? Guinan, we're at war! No, we're not. At least, we're not supposed to be. This is not a ship of war. This is a ship of peace. What you're suggesting... I am not suggesting. That ship from the past is not meant to be here. It's got to go back. Run a full electrolyte report. Boost the level of tricordrazine. Try to relax. Dr Selar, report to ward stat. Dr Selar, report to ward stat. I'm Capt Jean-Luc Picard. Rachel Garrett. How's my ship? The support systems are being restored. Continuing repairs. Where did you come from? We didn't pick up any other Federation ships. What's the last thing you remember? We were answering the distress signal. Distress signal? You must have heard it. From the Klingon outpost. Narendra III. But you didn't... did you? This... sickbay, I've never seen anything like it, even on a starbase. And your uniform. What ship is this, Captain? Please try to be still. I must insist. What ship? You're aboard the Enterprise. 1 701 ... D. You have come 22 years into the future. 22 years... Does my crew know yet? No. I must tell them. I owe them that. If you wish, they'll be informed. Any reason they should not be told? If you return to your own time with knowledge of the future... We barely escaped with our lives. If we returned, we'd be destroyed. Have you any idea how this happened? There were... There was a... fierce volley of photon torpedoes. We were hit. A bright light, and then here. It is possible that this exchange of fire was the catalyst for the formation of a temporal rift. History has no record of your battle with the Romulans. We were responding to a distress call from the Klingon outpost on Narendra Ill. The Romulans were attacking it. We engaged them. But there were four war birds. The outpost was destroyed. It is regrettable you did not succeed. A Federation starship rescuing a Klingon outpost... ..might have averted 20 years of war. I still can't quite make myself believe it. 22 years! I have 40 percent on forward shields. What do you have on aft? 40 percent. That won't cut it. Commander, advise Lt La Forge that shields are below minimum. Acknowledged. We'll never see our homes again. Our families. How do you know your family's not still alive? You're right. I don't. But imagine coming home after 22 years. Would I recognize them? What are the stats on the main phaser banks? Emitters available, 60 percent forward, 52 percent aft. Good. Let's take a look at the torpedo launchers. I guess I'm lucky to be alive at all. You may not like the future. It's been a long war. The Federation has lost more than half of Starfleet to the Klingons. We were negotiating a peace treaty when I left. A lot of changes, Lieutenant. A lot of changes. When we get a break, maybe you could fill me in on some of them. Photon banks are depleted. Auxiliary fusion generators are down. It is highly probable that the temporal rift is symmetrical. What would happen if the Enterprise-C were to fly back through it? Back, sir? She would emerge in her own time at almost the same instant she left. Right in the middle of the battle with the Romulans. Any possibility she could survive? None, sir. Then sending them back would be a death sentence. She was the first galaxy-class warship built by the Federation. 42 decks. Capable of transporting over 6,000 troops. How long have you been on board? Four years. Straight out of the Academy. I was lucky to get the Enterprise. Yeah, me too. I mean... my Enterprise. Lieutenant, how's the ship? We've restored minimal shields in the forward phaser banks. Still no photon launchers or warp drive. Concentrate on the weapons system. From what I hear, the Federation can use all the help it can get. And soon. Our sensors have picked up Klingon warships in the sector. Why wasn't I informed? You shouldn't... As senior officer, I want you to be my liaison to the Enterprise-D. Where do you think you're going? I'm resuming my duties. You need at least another 24 hours. Nonsense. Doctors overprotect patients. And captains push themselves too hard. Doctor, my ship and my crew need me now. 24 hours might as well be 24 years. I need more. There is no more. I wish there were. I wish I could prove it. But I can't. Then I can't ask them to go back. You've got to. Guinan, they will die moments after they return. How can I ask them to sacrifice themselves solely on your intuition? I don't know. But I do know that this is a mistake. Every fibre in my being says this is a mistake. I can't even explain it to myself. I only know that I'm right. Who is to say that this history is any less proper than the other? I suppose I am. Not good enough, dammit! I will not ask them to die. 40 billion people already have. This war's not meant to be happening. Send those people back to correct it. What is to guarantee that if they go back they will succeed? Every instinct is telling me this is wrong, dangerous, futile! We've known each other a long time. You have never known me to impose myself on anyone or take a stance based on trivial or whimsical perceptions. This timeline must not be allowed to continue. I've told you what you must do. You have only your trust in me to help you decide to do it. I mean, deflector shield technology has advanced considerably during the war. Our heat-dissipation rates are double those of the Enterprise-C. Which means we can hang in a firefight... a lot longer. Guinan? Have you ordered yet, Tasha? No, not yet. Is anything wrong? Not a thing. What can I get for you? Just a couple of TKLs. I'm in a hurry. This is Lt Castillo. First time for everything. First time? I've never seen anything bother her before. What's a TKL? Standard rations. Food replicators are on minimum power so everything else is diverted to the defensive systems. So where was l? You've told me more about tactical in an hour than I learned in a year at the Academy. You'll need it, Lieutenant! I've known you a whole day now, Lieutenant. I won't salute if you won't. What did she call you? Tasha. Yeah. Almost everyone calls me Castillo. My mother calls me Richard. OK, Castillo. No... I think maybe I'd like it better if you called me Richard. Richard. This is the captain. Senior officers, report to my ready room immediately. So much for lunch. Are you suggesting we let them return and try to complete their mission? I am, Doctor. Based on Guinan's intuition? It won't achieve anything. They can't save Narendra Ill. There are four Romulan war birds. The Enterprise-C would be outgunned. Unless we were to rearm them. We can't do that. If we did, we'd be altering the past. That's what you're talking about anyway. We're talking about restoring the past. How could Guinan know history's been altered if she's been altered too? Her species may have a perception that goes beyond linear time. There are many inexplicable things about her species. Yet she may be correct. A ship from the past has travelled through time. How can we know the effects of that? We will never know if she is correct. But the consequences of that possibility are too grave to ignore. Dismissed. If you'd like my opinion... I'm aware of your opinion. This is a briefing. I don't seek your consent. With respect, you'd be asking 1 25 people to die a meaningless death. Not necessarily meaningless. Klingons regard honour above all else. If the crew of the Enterprise-C had died defending a Klingon outpost, it would be considered an act of honour by the Klingon empire. Even their deaths could have prevented this war. If the Enterprise-C returns to battle and its mission is a success, history will be changed. This timeline will cease to exist. I've considered the alternatives. I'll go with Guinan's recommendation. Dismissed. If she's right, we may not even be in another timeline. Who knows if we're even dead or alive? Engineering. Is Engineering your destination as well? What? Deck six. Sorry. If I interpret your facial expressions correctly, you are preoccupied with something... unpleasant. No, l... I was just thinking. About a lot of things. I... I've been working with one of the officers on the Enterprise-C. He's nice. I like him. I'm worried about what's going to happen to him. We may never know. If they succeed, we will not even realize that these events occurred. Shields are up to 72 percent. That's better. Good. Do you believe this Guinan? I discovered long ago that she has a special wisdom. I trust it. I could arrange for you to speak with her, if you wish. I would be lying to you if I said there was a chance in hell of coming out of this alive. Why not bring your ship back with us? The Romulans are no match for you. I can't do that. No, I suppose not. You don't belong in our time any more than we belong in yours. To be honest with you, a significant number of my crew have expressed a desire to return, even knowing the odds. Some because they can't bear to live without their loved ones, some because they don't like slipping out in the middle of a fight. But I have told them that in the here and now the Federation needs another ship against the Klingons. And we'd better get used to being in the here and now. But if you go back, it could be a great deal more helpful. The war is going very badly for us, far worse than is generally known. Starfleet Command believes defeat is inevitable. Within six months, we may have no choice but to surrender. And all this may be a result of our arrival here? One more ship will make no difference in the here and now. But 22 years ago, one ship could have stopped this war before it started. Mr. Castillo. Yes, Captain? Inform the crew we're going back. Yes, Captain. The Romulans will get a good fight! We'll make it one for the history books. I know you will, Captain. Lt Yar? Permission to remain a moment, sir? Granted. Transporter room, Capt Picard is ready to return to his ship. Aye, Captain. I just wanted to say good luck. I'll put your tactical briefing to good use when we get back. Your ship has more manoeuvrability than the Romulans of that era. If you could just isolate... You'll do fine. If you get back to Earth, and you see a man, say, in his late 50s, taking a hard, long look across a crowded room... Hey, you never know. Goodbye, Lieutenant. Red alert! Full power to shields. Shields are up. Initiating evasive manoeuvres. Ready phasers. Enterprise-D, has your captain returned? Acknowledged. Capt Picard is safely aboard. Fire phasers. Firing phasers. Report. One Klingon bird of prey off the starboard bow. Firing phasers. Load torpedo bays. The Klingon vessel has recloaked. I have no readings. Capt Garrett, damage report. Capt Garrett? This is Lt Yar, sir. Capt Garrett is dead. I'm prepared to lead the Enterprise back myself, Capt Picard. Lt Castillo is the last surviving senior officer. He will have limited ops support, reduced staff in Engineering... I have good people willing to do their best. History never meant you to go into battle without a captain. I cannot speak to that, but I can get us back to where we're meant to be. That's what Capt Garrett would want me to do. Cmdr Data to Capt Picard. Go ahead. Sensors show additional instability in the time rift, possibly the result of the battle with the Klingons. Any signs of other Klingon vessels? No, sir. Our coordinates have been sent to the Klingons. We mustn't remain here. Sir, it is my intention to return. Unless you order me not to. How soon can your ship be ready? We sustained moderate damage. We can be under way in a few hours. Make it so. We'll give you cover. One to beam to the Enterprise-C. We keep saying goodbye, don't we? I wish we had more time. More time? I think we have all the time we can handle as it is! Lieutenant. Can I get you something, Tasha? I have to know something. What happens to me in the other timeline? I don't have alternate biographies of the crew. And as I said to the captain, it's just a feeling. But there's something more when you look at me, isn't there? I can see it in your eyes, Guinan. We've known each other too long. We weren't meant to know each other at all! At least that's what I sense when I look at you. Tasha, you're not supposed to be here. Where am I supposed to be? Dead. Do you know how? No. But I do know it was an empty death. A death without purpose. Come. Yes, Lieutenant? Captain, I request to transfer to the Enterprise-C. For what reason? They need someone at Tactical. We need you here. I'm not supposed to be here, sir. Sit down, Lieutenant. What did she say to you? I don't belong here, sir. I'm... I'm... supposed to be dead. She felt it necessary to reveal that to you? I felt it was necessary. I see. You realize that it's very possible the Enterprise-C will fail? We will continue in this timeline, in which case your life, hopefully, will continue for a long while. I know how important it is that they don't fail. It's why I request this. You don't belong on that ship. No, Capt Garrett belongs on it. But she's dead. And I think there's a certain logic in this request. There's no logic in this at all! Whether they succeed or not,... ..the Enterprise-C will be destroyed. But at least with someone at Tactical, they will have a chance to defend themselves well. It may be a matter of seconds, but those could change history. Guinan says I died a senseless death in the other timeline. I didn't like the sound of that, Captain. I've always known the risks that come with the Starfleet uniform. If I'm to die in one,... ..I'd like my death to count for something. Lieutenant... Permission granted. Thank you, sir. I've got phaser banks at 70 percent efficiency. We've got an hour left. Let's try and get them up to 90. Aye, sir. Parker, you've got ops. Fredericks, take the conn. I'll handle Tactical. Lt Tasha Yar reporting for duty, sir. You're not in my crew. I am now. Capt Picard approved my request for transfer. This isn't a joke, Tasha. We're going back into the rift, into battle. We're not coming back. I know the mission. These are my orders, Lieutenant. But I don't want you here. You need me here. Can someone in your crew do the job better than I can? Welcome aboard. Take your station, Lieutenant. Aye, sir. Military log, supplemental. Lt Tasha Yar has transferred to the Enterprise-C, where she has taken over tactical duties. Meanwhile we have picked up Klingon cruisers on an intercept course. Number and type of ships? Three K'vort-class battle cruisers. Not even cloaking themselves. They shouldn't be so confident, after the pasting they got on Archer IV. Attention all hands. As you know, we could outrun the Klingon vessels, but we must protect the Enterprise-C until she enters the temporal rift, and we must succeed. Let's make sure history never forgets the name... ..Enterprise. Picard out. Mr. Data? Shields are holding. Hold fire. Mr. Crusher, come about to course 1 48 003. Aye, sir. Photon torpedoes are ready. Dispersal pattern... sierra. And fire! One enemy target hit, sir. Moderate damage to their forward shields. Shields still holding. Minor damage to secondary hull. Course 1 48... Correction, course 1 70 mark 01 4. Sir, one ship is breaking off towards the Enterprise-C. Mr. Crusher, keep us within 200 km of the Enterprise-C. Coming to 217 mark 115, increasing to two-thirds impulse. Damage control teams, deck 1 4! Engineering to bridge. Starboard power coupling is down. Field generator three is damaged. Attempting to bypass. If we lose antimatter... Acknowledged. The Klingons are attempting to draw us away from Enterprise-C. Hold course. Continual fire, all phasers. One enemy target destroyed, sir. Damage report? Casualty in the secondary hull. Navigational sensor array inoperative. Antimatter containment fields are failing. I may have to dump the reactor core or she'll blow! Shields buckling. They will not... I can't hold the containment fields. Initiating emergency shutdown! Coolant leak in the engine core. I can't shut it down. I estimate two minutes to a warp core breach! Go! Go! Go! How long till they enter the rift? 52 seconds, sir. All remaining power to the defence systems. Power couplings severed in forward phaser banks. Attempting to bypass. Controls not responding. Federation ship Enterprise, surrender and prepare to be boarded. That will be the day! Report, Lieutenant. Readings fluctuated. It appeared to be a ship, but then it vanished. The phenomenon is closing in on itself. Very well. Prepare a class-one sensor probe. We'll leave it behind to monitor the final closure. Lay in a course for Archer IV. Captain, this is Guinan. Is everything alright up there? Guinan?! Yes, everything's fine. Something wrong? No. No, everything's fine. Sorry to bother you. Geordi, tell me about... ..Tasha Yar. "
S3E16,"Captain's log, stardate 43657.0. While Cmdr Riker is away on leave the Enterprise has travelled to Sector 396 to begin charting the Selebi Asteroid Belt. He sent for you, too? Yes. He was very mysterious. Any idea what this is about? Since the cybernetics conference he's spent all his time in that lab. It's not like Data to be so secretive. And cautious. He's kept that lab locked. Now, how would you know that? You are early. One moment please. You may enter now. Come on, Data. What is this? Yeah, Data. What's going on? I have invited you here to meet someone. This is Lal. Lal, say hello to Counsellor Deanna Troi. Hello, Counsellor Deanna Troi. How do you do, Lal? I am functioning within normal parameters. Lal, this is Geordi La Forge. Purpose for exterior drapings, Father? It is an accepted custom to wear clothes. Data, it called you Father. Yes, Wesley. Lal is my child. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, supplemental. I have just been advised of Cmdr Data's highly unusual project. Lal has a positronic brain, similar to my own. I began programming it at the conference. Nobody's done that since you were programmed. True, but I learned about a new submicron matrix transfer, which can be used to lay down complex neural-net pathways. You did a transfer from your brain to Lal's? Exactly. I realized for the first time that it was possible to continue Dr Soong's work. My initial transfers produced encouraging results. So I brought Lal's brain back. Data? I would like to have been consulted. I have not observed anyone else consult you about their procreation. Why didn't you give it a more human look, Data? I have decided to let my child choose its own sex and appearance. Data, I would like to talk with you in my ready room. Counsellor? We must discourage his perception of this new android as a child. It is not a child! It is an extraordinary invention. Why should biology, not technology, determine whether it's a child? Data has created an offspring. A new life out of his own being. To me, that suggests a child. If he wishes to call Lal his child, who are we to argue? Well, if he must. I fail to understand how an android with heuristic learning systems and the strength of ten men can be called a child! You've never been a parent. What you have done will have serious ramifications. I am truly dismayed that you told no one of what you were doing. I am sorry, Captain. I did not anticipate your objections. Do you wish me to deactivate Lal? It's a life! It can't be activated and deactivated simply! This is a most... stupendous undertaking. Do you know what will happen when Starfleet learns of this? I have followed all of Starfleet's regulations. I expected they would be pleased. Well, you have taken on quite a responsibility, Data. To prepare, I scanned all available literature on parenting. There seems to be much confusion. One traditional doctrine insists, ""Spare the rod, spoil the child,"" suggesting a punitive approach. While a more liberal attitude allows a child great freedom. Data... While Klingon parents... I am not talking about parenting, but the consequences of creating a new life! Does that not describe becoming a parent, sir? Data, you are seeking to achieve what only your own creator has been able to achieve. To make another functioning, sentient android. To make another Data. That is why I must attempt this, sir. Most species have a primal instinct to perpetuate themselves. Until now, I have been the last of my kind. If I were damaged or destroyed, I would be lost for ever. But if I am successful with the creation of Lal, my continuance is assured. I understand the risk, sir, and I am prepared to accept the responsibility. Gender, female. That's right. Just like me. Gender, male. Correct. And I am gender... neuter. Inadequate. That is why you must choose a gender to complete your appearance. What are criteria? Your data bank on sexuality, level two, will define parameters. Whatever you decide will be yours for life. Your decision will affect how people interrelate with you. I choose your sex and appearance. No, Lal. That would be confusing. The holodeck will present several thousand composites I programmed. You may choose from them. Several thousand? This is a big decision. Counsellor? Lal has narrowed the choices to four. Would you like to see? Yes, of course, Data. Computer, Lal gender sequence finalists. Begin. An Andorian female. Interesting. You'll be the only one on board the Enterprise. That could make socialization more difficult. A human male. Very attractive. No problem with socialization here. A human female. I like her. A Klingon male. A friend for Worf. They're all very interesting. Do you have a favourite? Yes. I have chosen. I have completed assembly. I provided Lal with more realistic skin and eye colour than my own. Congratulations, Data. It's a girl. This is home, Lal. Home. Place of residence. Social unit formed by a family living together. Yes. We are a family, Lal. Chair. To sit in. Sit. Good. Painting. Painting. Colours produced on a surface by applying a pigment. Yes. I will teach you to recognize the artistry in paintings. Soft. Yes. Very good, Lal. You have correctly processed the sense of touch. There are many fascinating experiences I wish to share with you. Painting. No. That is a flower, Lal. Inhale. Smell! Yes! Show me more, Father! Science log, supplemental. Training in elementary social skills has begun. Lal is progressing very slowly, but is not deterred by early setbacks. Coordination has improved, but reflexes still need to develop. Visual comprehension is especially difficult. Translating her databanks into recognizable applications may improve with additional transfers. She is learning to supplement her android behaviour with simulated human responses. It is interesting to note that as I observe Lal learning, I share in her experience, almost as though I am learning things over again. The transfer is fairly simple. Each neural pathway in my brain is duplicated in hers. Theoretically, her brain should be able to store the same information. But until transfer is complete, we will not know. What does Lal do if you're on duty? She studies. She requires little supervision. Lal is quite self-sufficient. What about school? She has access to all human knowledge from me. She could learn a lot by being with children her own age. She is only two weeks old. OK, close to her own age. Dr Crusher to Ensign Crusher. Shouldn't you be getting a haircut, Wesley? I'm on my way. Parents! Nothing personal. Lal, the third cross-link transfer series is complete. Father? What is my purpose? Purpose? My function, my reason for being. That is a complex question, Lal. I can only begin to answer by telling you that our function is to contribute in a positive way to the world in which we live. Why am I me, instead of someone else? Because you are my child. Where did I come from? These questions suggest that we have made a successful transfer of the heuristic associative pathways. You will now begin to process information on logic, aesthetics, metaphysics and epistemology. You are truly becoming sentient. How? By developing the awareness to examine your perceptions. Why do we have two hands? Why not three or four? Why is the sky black? Why do...? Tomorrow will be your first day at school, Lal. Admiral, there is no better guide into this life for Lal than Data. We all admire what Cmdr Data has already achieved. But we have superior facilities and personnel here at Galor IV. A starship is hardly the proper setting... This starship's mission is to seek out new life, as Data is doing. We all want what's best for the new android. As do l. I would consider releasing Lal and Data to you, so he may continue his work with her. His presence would retard the new android's progress. Admiral, to you, Lal is a new android. But to Data, she's his child. His child? Yes, it may not be easy for us to see her that way, but he does. And I respect that. They will remain here for now. Starfleet's policy on research is clear. You're making a stand on very uncertain ground. I hope it doesn't fall out from under you. Haftel out. She achieved a very high score on the academic test. A perfect score? Yes. So we started her with the older children. But Lal couldn't understand the nuances of how they related to each other. I see. We decided to put her with younger children. That would seem to be reasonable. It isn't working out that way. The children were afraid of her. Father, what is the significance of laughter? It is a human physiological response to humour. Judging from their laughter, the children found my remarks humorous. So, without understanding humour, I have somehow mastered it. Deck 1 5. Lal? Yes, Father? The children did not laugh with you, they laughed at you. Explain. One is meant kindly, the other is not. Why would they wish to be unkind? Because you are different. Differences sometimes scare people. I have learned that some of them use humour to hide their fear. I do not wish to be different. Doctor? I require your advice, as a successful parent. Well, thank you, Data. I'd like to think I was. Well, please sit down. How's Lal? Lal is realizing she is not the same as other children. Is it lonely for her? She does not feel loneliness. But she can observe how isolated she is from the others. She wishes to be more like them. I do not know how to help her. Lal is passing into sentience. It is a difficult stage of her development. When... When Wesley was growing up, he was an extraordinarily bright boy. But he had a hard time making friends. I think the other children were intimidated by him. That is precisely what happened to Lal. How did you help him? Well... First I went back to my own childhood and remembered how painful it was for me. Because... I remember a time when I wasn't very popular either. When I told that to Wesley, it made him feel better. He knew I understood. I have not told Lal how difficult it was for me to assimilate. I did not wish to discourage her. Perhaps that was an error in judgement. You didn't have anyone to help you through sentience. She at least has you. Just help her realize she's not alone. And be there to nurture her when she needs love and attention. I can give her attention, Doctor, but I am incapable of giving her love. Now why do I find that so hard to believe? Captain, incoming signal. Starfleet priority one. Admiral Haftel. On my monitor, Lieutenant. Admiral. Capt Picard. I hope I didn't disturb you. Not at all. I discussed my concerns with Starfleet Command. Hold your position until I join you. I shall personally review the android's development. Understood. I should advise you that if I'm not satisfied with what I see, I am empowered to take the android back with me. Haftel out. Captain's log, supplemental. We are holding position pending the arrival of Admiral Haftel. Cmdr Data is completing his final neural transfers to the android he has named Lal, which, I have learned, in the language Hindi means ""beloved"". Hello, Data. Guinan. Lal! How are you? I am functioning within normal... I am fine, thank you. Good. Guinan, Lal needs to observe human behaviour. She's in the right place. And for this opportunity, she is willing to assist you. Father says I would learn a lot from someone as old as you. You're hired. The most important part of this job is the art of listening. I have some expertise, so I shall teach you. That would be most beneficial. I've been programmed with a listing of 1 ,41 2 beverages. What did you say? I've been programmed... ""I've""? You used a verbal contraction. You said ""I've"", not ""I have"". A skill my program has never mastered. Then I will desist. No. You have exceeded my abilities. I do not object, but I do not understand how this occurred. Picard to Data, report to my ready room. Aye, sir. I am certain the Admiral is anxious to meet Lal. I have sent him regular reports on her development. His visit is not just an inspection of Lal's progress. He has expressed a concern for her environment. Her environment, sir? He believes the Daystrom annex on Galor IV would be more suitable. Then he wishes to relocate us. Not you, Data. Just her. I would not be in favour of that. There are things she can learn only from me. My lifetime of experiences. My mistakes and what I learned from them. Captain, Cmdr Riker's shuttle has just returned. Acknowledged, Lieutenant. Advise him I will meet with him in one hour. Picard out. The Admiral thinks Lal's development should be overseen by experienced personnel. He is questioning my ability as a parent. In a manner of speaking. Does the Admiral have children? Yes, I believe he does. Why? I am forced to wonder how much experience he had as a parent when his first child was born. You see? What are they doing? It's called flirting. They seem to be communicating telepathically. They're both thinking the same thing, if that's what you mean. Is the joining of hands a symbolic act for humans? It shows affection. Humans like to touch each other. They start with the hands and go from there. He's biting that female! No, he's not. They're pressing lips. It's called kissing. Why are they leaving? Lal, some things your father will explain when you're ready. You're new around here, aren't you? Yes. Lal! Put him down! Commander, what are your intentions toward my daughter? Your daughter? Nice to meet you. I watch them and I can do the things they do, but I will never feel the emotions. I'll never know love. It is a limitation we must learn to accept, Lal. Then why do you still emulate humans? What purpose does it serve except to remind you that you are incomplete? I have asked myself that many times, as I have struggled to be more human. Until I realized it is the struggle itself that is most important. We must strive to be more than we are, Lal. It does not matter that we will never reach our ultimate goal. The effort yields its own rewards. You are wise, Father. It is the difference between knowledge and experience. I learned today that humans like to hold hands. It is a symbolic gesture of affection. No objective viewpoint could see it any other way. Forgive me, Admiral, I thought you came to form an opinion, not justify one. Let's not make this more difficult than it needs to be. I see no need for difficulty. I understand your concerns. What I'm asking for is time. Patience. If you have an open mind, you will see that Data and Lal should stay together in her formative stages. After that, I have no doubt Data will be delighted to send her to Starfleet Research. That's not satisfactory. If mistakes are made, the damage that's done might be irreparable. The damage will be irreparable if they're separated. Captain, are we talking about breaking up a family? Isn't that rather a sentimental attitude about androids? They're living, sentient beings. I helped define their rights and privileges in our society. Yes, Captain. I am more than willing to acknowledge that. What you must acknowledge is that Lal may be a technological step forward in artificial intelligence. A most significant step. Yes. Work like this demands controlled procedures. Which Data is following. In effective isolation. That is what Starfleet Research finds unacceptable. Lal now possesses the sum of my programming. Her neural nets are laid down identically to yours? There are some quantum variations. She uses contractions. I cannot. An aberration. What have you done about this? Maintained records on positronic matrix activity behavioural norms and verbal patterns. I have seen no other aberrations. It seems you have improved upon yourself. Is that not the goal of every parent? But as a good father, don't you think it would be better if Lal were with people trained in evaluative procedures? I am programmed with those procedures. And in any meaningful evaluation of Lal, you would require a model for a basis of comparison. I am the only model available. You haven't mastered human cultural and behavioural norms yet? No, sir. Where is Lal now? This is your idea of appropriate guidance? It is a chance for her to observe human behaviour. More importantly, for her to interact with her crew mates. She can run over 60 trillion calculations a second, and you have her working as a waitress! She is under the strict guidance of a woman in whom I have absolute trust. Ten-forward is the centre of social activity. Everyone comes here. The behaviour she observes may well not be a positive influence. Most people here behave themselves. If they don't, I ask them to leave. Admiral Haftel, Guinan. She runs ten-forward. How is Lal doing? She spills a few drinks, but she's learning. I want that android out of here. Admiral, you've been in one or two bars in your time. Have her report to me immediately for an interview. Lal, I've been looking forward to meeting you. Why? You're very important to us at Starfleet Research. We have quite a facility at Galor IV. I want to show it to you. The Admiral is suggesting you be moved to Galor IV, Lal. Have I done something wrong? No, of course not. We want to broaden your experience. There's only so much you can learn on a starship. I'm sure you agree. Yes, I agree. Good. The natural conclusion is, when I have learned all there is to learn here, I would relocate to Galor IV. That is not the natural conclusion. I believe it is. Lal, the Admiral is concerned that you need more guidance than your father can provide here. Yes. Don't misunderstand me, I have great respect for your father. You do not speak with respect. She seems very adversarial. I'm merely stating a fact, Admiral. I don't think your father has taught you selective judgement in the verbalization of your own thoughts. That is a skill we will help you develop. My father is already helping me. The question is, has he helped you enough? Are you asking me, sir? No, I didn't mean to... Why don't we, Admiral? In these discussions, no one has mentioned her wishes. She is a free, sentient being. What are your wishes, Lal? I wish to remain here, Capt Picard. Thank you, Lal. You're excused. Come in. Hello, Lal. How are you? Troi. Admiral. An admiral from Starfleet has come to take me away, Troi. I am scared. You are scared, aren't you? I feel it. How is this possible? I don't know. This is what it means to feel! This is what it means to feel. You have Lal off to a wonderful start in life, Commander. That's what being a parent is all about. However, I have finally decided I must ask you to release her to me. May I ask why, sir? There is one argument that is irrefutable. Only two Soong-type androids exist. It would be dangerous to have you in the same place, especially here. One lucky shot by a Romulan, we'd lose you both. Admiral, that is a fine argument. But... ..it doesn't change my feeling that the proper place for Lal to develop is by Data's side. You're not a parent, Captain. I am. I have learned, with difficulty, that there comes a time when... There comes a time when all parents must give up their children. But this is not the time! Damn it, even I can see the... The umbilical cord is virtually uncut! The child... The child depends on him. Mr. Data, it would be better for Lal if she left knowing that you had voluntarily decided that this was the best course of action. Admiral, when I created Lal, it was in the hope that someday she would choose to enter the Academy. I wanted to give something back in return for all that Starfleet has given me. I still do. But Lal is my child. You ask that I volunteer to give her up. I cannot. It would violate every lesson I have learned about human parenting. I have brought a new life into this world. And it is my duty, not Starfleet's, to guide her through these difficult steps to maturity, to support her as she learns, to prepare her to be a contributing member of society. No one can relieve me from that obligation. And I cannot ignore it. I am... ..her father. Then I regret that I must order you to transport Lal aboard my ship. Belay that order, Mr. Data. I beg your pardon? I will take this to Starfleet myself. I am Starfleet, Captain! Proceed, Commander. Hold your ground, Mr. Data. You are jeopardizing your command and your career. There are times, sir, when men of good conscience cannot blindly follow orders. You acknowledge their sentience, but you ignore their personal liberties and freedom. Order a man to hand his child over to the State? Not while I'm his captain. If you wish, you can accompany us to Starfleet, where we... Troi to Cmdr Data. Report to your lab at once. Acknowledged. He's on his way. Is there a problem? Yes, Captain. Something is terribly wrong with Lal. It lasted barely a moment. She experienced fear and confusion. And then, for no apparent reason, she walked out. She just started walking here. And each step became more difficult. Lal is programmed to return here in the event of a malfunction. Father? Yes, Lal, I am here. A malfunction. Emotional awareness. It appears to be a symptom of cascade failure. It would require initialization of the base matrix. I agree. May I assist? Thank you, Admiral. If you'll excuse us? Cmdr Data and I have much to do. She won't survive much longer. There was nothing anyone could do. We'd repolarize one pathway and another would collapse. And then another. His hands were moving faster than I could see, trying to stay ahead of each breakdown. He refused to give up. He was remarkable. It just... wasn't meant to be. Lal? I am unable to correct the system failure. I know. We must say goodbye now. I feel... What do you feel, Lal? I love you, Father. I wish I could feel it with you. I will feel it for both of us. Thank you for my life. Flirting. Laughter. Painting. Family. Female. Human. Lal suffered complete neural-system failure at 1 300 hours. I have deactivated the unit. The crew is saddened by your loss, Mr. Data. I thank you for your sympathy, but... ..she is here. Her presence so enriched my life, that I could not allow her to pass into oblivion. So I incorporated her programs back into my own. I have transferred her memories to me. Mr. Data, will you take your position? Mr. Crusher? Lay in a course for the starbase on Otar II. Course is set, sir. Engage. "
S3E17,"Captain's log, stardate 43685.2. As an exchange programme, we are taking aboard a Klingon officer to return the recent visit of Cmdr Riker to the cruiser Pagh. Cmdr Kurn must be accorded all the rights and responsibilities due to a first officer on board this ship. If he feels patronized... We'd know. One does not patronize a Klingon warrior. Your experience on board the Pagh will be invaluable during his tour. Be sure the crew are prepared for any unusual orders. Klingons are thorough. I'm sure he has studied for this, just as I did when I was with them. I understand he requested the Enterprise specifically. Cmdr Kurn is ready for transport, Captain. Energize. Welcome aboard, Commander. I'm Capt Picard. This is Cmdr William Riker. He will yield the first officer's position to you during your tour. You are relieved. May I take my station, sir? I thought I might show you to your quarters first. I am ready for duty, sir. I ask that I be allowed to take my station. Very well. Accompany us to the bridge. I am Kurn, commander rank, Klingon Defence Force. You will address me as ""Commander"" or ""sir"" at all times. I am fully aware of all Starfleet regulations and they will be strictly adhered to by all while I am in command. I will bring a sense of discipline that you may not be accustomed to. With your permission, Captain. By all means, Commander. I have studied all of your Starfleet records. Impressive. We shall see if you live up to your reputations. Do you wish to speak, Acting Ensign Crusher? No, sir, Commander, sir. The crew awaits your orders, Captain. Then take us to the outer cometary cloud, Commander. Set course 114 mark 230. One-third impulse power. Aye, sir. Execute! Engaged. Increasing to one-third impulse power, sir! Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Mind if I join you? No, sir. Something wrong, Wes? Cmdr Kurn, perhaps? He just doesn't seem to like me. I can't do anything right for him. Every time I respond to an order, he jumps down my throat. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Problem, Geordi? Yes, sir. It's our new first officer. He found fault with Engineering? Just the entire section! He made a surprise inspection during maintenance. I tried to explain... But he wouldn't listen. We're on double shifts down there. His style of command is just different. Klingons believe in obedience and a strict formality of command. Yeah, but this isn't a Klingon vessel. He'll have to loosen up. And it's not just us. He's been leaning into everybody, except... Except the one guy who wouldn't mind it. Sensors picking up asteroidal debris ahead. Can you identify the coordinates, Mr. Worf? Bearing: 001 mark .03. Range: 300,000 kilometres. Excellent! Please scan the asteroid field for me, Lieutenant, and report. Approximately 2,000 small objects, none directly in our flight path. So no course correction is necessary. Is that what you are saying? It should not be needed, sir. Very good, Lieutenant! You handled that well. Yes? Commander. Captain's mess? Yes. Resume. Your knowledge of our systems and procedures is very impressive. Sir. I would like to make one suggestion, sir. A suggestion? When I served aboard the Pagh, the hardest part for me was recognizing and adapting to the demands of the crew. They needed an iron hand. It must be very difficult to work with a crew that is... so different. I would be happy to guide you in that regard, if it would help. No, Commander, it wouldn't. This is not a Klingon ship, sir. No, Commander, it is not. If it were a Klingon ship, I would have killed you for offering your suggestion. How long has this bird been dead? It appears to have been lying in the sun for some time. It's not dead, it's been replicated. You do understand that we cook most of our foods? Ah, yes, I was told to prepare for that. I shall try some of your burned replicated bird meat! I have attempted to select a menu with a variety of dishes, Commander. Try some caviar. The odour is not palatable. What is it? The unhatched eggs of a large, scaleless... Later, Data. A fish, Commander. A delicacy from the Caspian Sea on Earth. It's a favourite of mine. Our replicator never does it justice, but I managed to store a few cases for special occasions. I am honoured, Captain. Are you adjusting to your new environment? I find the constraints a bit difficult to conform to. A short while ago, I had to stop myself from killing Cmdr Riker. He was trying to communicate the crew's discomfort with my style of command. Normally, I would consider that a challenge to my authority. One of the aims of the exchange is for us all to learn tolerance. As for my crew, it may be healthy to shake up the status quo at times. The Commander certainly appears to have the crew on its toes. And then some! No offence, sir. None taken. I never kill anyone at the supper table, Mr. La Forge. Don't you like it, Commander? Our food has much more taste to it. While I am sure this is well-prepared, it is much too bland for the stomach of a Klingon. It seems to agree with Worf. Yes. Enter. Permission to speak freely? For what purpose? I have questions I wish to pose. Are your quarters so comfortable? They serve me. This entire ship seems built on comfort, relaxation, being at ease. It is not the ship of a warrior, not the ship of a Klingon. You cannot ask these questions within the boundaries of protocol? They are of a... ..personal nature, sir. Permission granted. Pose your questions. I wish to know if I have given you offence. I am not human. If you had given offence, you would not need to ask. Perhaps I have not performed my duties to your satisfaction. I find you to be a capable Starfleet officer, a credit to your ship. Yet you dishonour me at every opportunity! Have l? I did not know that being polite to a Starfleet officer would bring dishonour to him. I am a Klingon! Really? Perhaps your blood has thinned in this environment. I simply didn't want to hurt you. So your blood is not so thin after all! I am a Klingon! lf you doubt it, a demonstration can be arranged! That is the response of a Klingon, the response I would expect from my older brother. I was barely a year old when you left for the Khitomer outpost. You, our mother and father were not going to stay long. It was decided that I did not need to go. I was left to stay with our father's friend Lorgh until you returned. You never did. The Starfleet officer that rescued me was told by Klingon High Command that I had no living relatives. They assumed I was killed with the family at Khitomer. Lorgh had no sons. He took me into his family. Not until I reached the age of ascension was I told the truth. So you asked to serve aboard the Enterprise to watch me? It was an excellent opportunity to see what kind of Klingon you were. Or if you were a Klingon at all! Your deception offends me, Brother. It should. But it was required. To satisfy your curiosity. No. Much more. You are the eldest son. The challenge is yours to make. Challenge? The Klingon High Council has judged our father a traitor to the Empire. What are the allegations, Worf? My father is accused of aiding and abetting the Romulan attack on the Khitomer outpost. The attack in which he himself was killed? But why now, after 20 years? I do not know, Captain. I will hear the evidence when I arrive. The charge has been made by Duras, son of my father's greatest rival. Our family name will be disgraced for seven generations. It is my responsibility to clear his name or answer for his crimes. Answer for them? The family of a Klingon warrior is responsible for his actions and he is responsible for theirs. If I fail in my challenge, I will be executed. Will you grant my leave? No. If I understand correctly, a Starfleet officer, a respected member of my crew, could be accused of a capital crime. Your actions will reflect on this ship and on the Federation, therefore it seems only appropriate that your captain be at your side while you make your challenge. I'm sure you would do no less for me. Cmdr Kurn. We're changing course. Set coordinates for the First City of the Klingon Imperial Empire. We arrive within the hour. Yes. The Council will receive you at high sun in the Great Hall of... I know the procedure for the challenge. You need a cha'Dlch to defend you. While accused, you will not be allowed combat. I would be honoured if you chose me. I ask you to stand with me, to be my cha'Dlch. The two sons of Mogh! Together, we will restore the family honour. No. For the proceedings, you will not reveal your true father. I must. You will not! Because it would mean my death as well if you fail? A Klingon's honour means more to him than life. Perhaps your human values have clouded your judgement. I insist. On this ship, you are my commander and I obey. In Council chambers, you are my cha'Dlch. You do not insist. You obey. Yes, Brother. I am Worf, son of Mogh. I have come to challenge the lies that have been spoken of my father. Worf, son of Mogh, you have challenged the judgement of the Council. Are you prepared to answer for this if you fail? Yes! With my life. Why do you come before us, Commander? I am Kurn, son of... Lorgh. I will stand by Worf's side. I am cha'Dlch. You claim a birthright you have forsaken? I have not forsaken my heritage! I am Klingon! My heart is of this world. My blood is as yours. Yet you come to us wearing a child's uniform... ..and you bring outsiders to our Great Hall. I am here at my own request. I am Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise! Your words mean nothing here! Duras! Let him speak. Lt Worf has served under my command with distinction. He has earned my admiration and my respect. It is my greatest wish that this Council, in its wisdom, will clear his family name and return him to duty. The trust of a commanding officer is admirable. The Council notes it. Speak the accusation! For many turns, the truth about Khitomer has lain dormant, unknown. Now the truth has been revealed. The traitor Mogh sent the defence access codes to Romulan patrol ships, allowing them to destroy the outpost. Thousands died on Khitomer! My father died on Khitomer! Their deaths must be avenged. Your father was a traitor! By posing this challenge, you are a traitor! You will not wear the emblems of our people. You are a fool and your challenge can only result in a fool's death. It is a good day to die, Duras. And the day is not yet over. The Council stands in recess. We will return for the Mek'ba. The evidence will be presented. Mr. Data... Find out all you can about the destruction of Khitomer outpost. Cross-reference with Romulan tactics and information on the region and request access to the Klingon information net. Computer, overview of Klingon law concerning familial accountability. Accessing. In my ready room. I would speak with you. Alone. You should not have brought the challenge. There was no risk to you. What does it matter? I am Klingon. Of that I have no question. But your life in the Federation would not be affected by this judgement. My father... Is dead! He died long ago. I knew your father, served with him. This is not how I wanted to remember him. We must let the past be and protect what we have now. If you leave before the Mek'ba, no shame will come upon you. Return to your ship. Go back to your life. The challenge will be forgotten. Why would you ask me to lay aside the honour of my father, my family? Are these the words of the Council? I will not be questioned by you! Leave, now! Or you too will be condemned as a traitor. What Federation ship was closest to Khitomer at the time of the attack? The USS Intrepid was first on the scene. Contact Starfleet. Request all logs of the Intrepid. Riker to Dr Crusher. Crusher here. Check medical records from all rescue vessels that responded to the Khitomer massacre for information to help us. Understood. I should have known. Worf was right. It is a good day to die. The time has not yet come. It does not have to come for many turns. I know who you are, Kurn. Son of Mogh! What? It was a wise choice to hide your family name. Do not err now by embracing it again or you only embrace death. We shall see! Worf has made a choice and he will die for it. You can still be safe. Let him stand alone. He is my brother. I will not betray him. Then you will die for him. What kind of a weapon makes a vicious wound like that? It is a kut'luch. The ceremonial weapon of an assassin. Fortunately, his metabolic recovery is phenomenal. He will be alright. It does not matter. We should have let him die. Now that Duras knows his bloodlines,... ..we will both be executed. You sound like you've already lost, Worf. Commander, I have found the basis of the charges against Worf's father. The Klingons recently captured a Romulan ship with logs that provided new information on the attack. They clearly indicate a transmission from the outpost to the Romulan ship before the shields went down. From Worf's father? They do match Mogh's personal security code. How can we be sure it wasn't falsified? We can cross-check against the Intrepid logs. I will try, but the Intrepid was at the edge of sensor range. We cannot be certain if the scan was complete. Looks like a good match-up. Both Intrepid and Romulan logs show distress signals from Khitomer. What's that? Gaps in the Intrepid's logs. Missing information due to the range. That is where Mogh's transmission should be. Right in the middle of the gap? Wait a second, Data. Back up. Just before the gap, the time-base on both files are in perfect sync. But look. What happens to the signal after the shields are dropped? They are no longer synchronous. Somebody's been rewriting history. I do not fully understand your world's law and culture, Lieutenant, but I do understand when someone is trying to hide something. K'mpec urged me to drop my challenge, abandon my family honour. It was impossible to believe I was hearing a Klingon speak. Obviously they did not expect and never wanted this challenge. You're close to something they care a great deal about protecting. If it is true, it is not just Duras, but the High Council itself that is my enemy. Captain... I must choose another cha'Dlch. I would like your permission to ask one of the crew. Of course, Lieutenant. Choose whomever you wish. Then I ask you to stand with me. You may refuse with no dishonour. Thank you. I appreciate the gesture, but I know there are stronger and younger men from whom to choose. I can think of no one I would rather have at my side. I accept. My challenge will proceed. No threats, no treachery, will stop it. Not even a trap set for my cha'Dlch by a coward. Duras! I will not hear lies from the son of a traitor! Keep your place, Picard! This is my place. He is now my cha'Dlch. This is not your world, Human. You do not command here. I'm not here to command. Then you must be ready to fight. Something Starfleet does not teach you! You may test that assumption at your convenience. I've got something. Worf was not the only survivor at Khitomer. Another child? No. A Klingon woman was found with Worf. Kahlest. Who was she? I don't know. She was severely injured and treated at Starbase 24. That was when she was separated from Worf. After that she returned home. We've got to find her if she's still alive. Data, scan the Klingon central net, see if there's any record of her. The Romulans lowered the outpost shields themselves. They were given the defence access code. The record clearly shows the Romulan patrol ship receiving a personal transmission from Mogh seconds before the shields fell. Riker to Capt Picard. Stand by. The Khitomer commander had noted that Mogh was acting suspiciously. Go ahead, Number One. We've located another survivor. A woman who was found with Worf. Her name is Kahlest. She resides in the Old Quarter of the First City. Well done. Picard out. Another witness testified that Mogh often spoke of his admiration for the Romulans. Their culture. Their women... Mogh betrayed us and 4,000 Klingons died on Khitomer. Only the son of Mogh survived! K'mpec, may we have a short recess? Have you heard of a woman called Kahlest? She was my ghojmok. My nurse. She may be an eyewitness to your father's activities. But she died in the attack. No. She survived. She's in the Old Quarter. I'm going to find her. It is too dangerous. You must not go alone. Hey, I'm your cha'Dlch. Kahlest? What do you want? Your help. No. You don't even know what I want. You are cha'Dlch. I know. Then you also know that Worf's life is at stake. I cannot help. I am dead. A long time dead. Were you with Worf's father just before the Khitomer attack? No. My life ended on Khitomer. I served a proud family, a strong house. All that is gone. Worf is not gone. The family you served needs you again. I cannot help! Was his father a traitor? No! Mogh was loyal to the Emperor. Mogh suspected someone of plotting with the Romulans and followed them to Khitomer. Who? Who was the traitor? I do not know. Then we have no way to prove Mogh's innocence. And Worf will die as the son of a traitor. You must leave now, cha'Dlch. I am dead. My appreciation, madam. You are brave, cha'Dlch. Worf chose well. Kahlest, would they recognize you? Would they know who you are? K'mpec would remember Kahlest. I caught his eye back then. But he was too fat. Come back with me. They won't know how much you know. You may shake loose the truth. I will come. The evidence is clear. I would ask that the judgement stand. That Worf be condemned as the son of a traitor to the Empire. Worf, son of Mogh, the judgement of... K'mpec! The Mek'ba is not complete! I bring an eyewitness to the Khitomer massacre, one who has new evidence. What is it you think you know, old woman? Do not answer! It is the rule that evidence be presented in open council. She will die before she testifies! Be silent, Duras! Would you kill an old woman to cover your dishonour? Yes. It is your dishonour we are protecting here, isn't it, Duras? I have no reluctance to kill you, human! Are you prepared to hear her evidence in open council? Obviously, we would not. Kahlest, you can go now. It is... good to see you again. You are still fat, K'mpec! I asked you to leave, to let this challenge go unanswered, but you did not hear my words. And now it's come to this! Why did you judge my father guilty when you knew he was not? Someone had to be blamed. Those who captured the Romulan ship had learned of the treachery, but only the Council knew whose security code had been transmitted. Ja'rod, father of Duras. This Ha'Dlbah should have been fed to the dogs! His family is powerful. If the truth were known, it would shatter the Council, most certainly plunge us into civil war. You were in Starfleet. We did not expect you to challenge the judgement, nor did we know there was another son of Mogh. Worf's challenge is successful. The honour of his family must be restored. You do not understand. His challenge was defeated before he ever made it. You will not be allowed to present this evidence. The judgement stands. You will be condemned. So will your brother. There is no other way now. You admit the truth, yet expect him to accept punishment? What does this say of an Empire who holds honour so dear? The Empire will not be destroyed for one family's honour! Unacceptable, K'mpec! You have no say in this! I speak now as the Captain of the USS Enterprise and Lt Worf's Commander! You will not execute a member of my crew, nor will I turn his brother over to you! This is not the Federation, Picard. If you defy an order of the High Council, the alliance with the Federation could fall to dust! The alliance with the Federation is not based on lies, K'mpec! Protect your secrets if you must, but you will not sacrifice these men. I will die for the Empire. Lieutenant... The cha'Dlch will be silent! Allow my brother to return to his life. Only you need know his true bloodline. Not acceptable! His honour would demand revenge. If you allow him to live, I will give you something that will serve your purpose far more than my death. I will accept... discommendation! You... ..would do this in open council? It would be the same as admitting your father's guilt, Worf. So be it. Your heart is Klingon. It will be done. What has been said here will never be spoken of again. You are the son of a traitor. Now I am ready. Why is he doing this? I was prepared to die. Worf wants you to live. The name of your father must some day be cleared. He needs you alive with your honour intact. But to do this... There will be another day. Do not forget what he does here today. Do not let your children forget. You must also,... ..Brother. "
S3E18,"Captain's log, stardate 43714. 1. We have finally eradicated the Phyrox Plague on Cor Caroli V and will soon be proceeding to our next mission. A rendezvous with the USS Hood, to assist in their terraforming efforts on Browder IV. Commander, sensors detect abnormal energy in the Captain's quarters. Type? Undetermined. Riker to Capt Picard. Security team to Captain's quarters. Picard to Enterprise. Anyone receiving this transmission, please respond. Security override. Priority one. Is something the matter, Lieutenant? Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. It's alright. I'm not going to hurt you. Captain. Picard, of the Enterprise. Captain Picard... We studied your missions at the Academy. Mitena Haro, cadet, Starfleet Academy. Cadet Haro. Perhaps you can explain what this is all about. Unfortunately, I can't, Mr...? Tholl. Kova Tholl of Mizar II. Well, Mr. Tholl, all I know is I'm here against my will. Wherever ""here"" is. It was the same with me, sir. I was alone, studying and... I fainted. When I came to... it was about three days ago. And you, sir? I've been here 1 2 days, possibly more. I was meditating and suddenly lost consciousness. What do you know about our captors? Nothing. They've never shown themselves. Four sleeping areas. That implies we may be joined by another captive. It's edible. But I wouldn't call it food. Don't touch that. Why not? If it's the door lock, the combination's too complex to hit at random. I tried it and was punished. Punished? How? Severe pain. Some sort of energy beam. I won't go near that panel again. Sir, the Hood has arrived at the rendezvous point. They are expecting us in 36 hours. Thank you, Lieutenant. Mr. Data, the nearest pulsar is in the Lonka Cluster, is it not? Correct, sir. What do we know about that pulsar? A great deal. It is a rotating neutron star of approximately 4.356 solar masses. Mr. Crusher, how long would it take us to get there? At warp seven, 34 minutes, sir. Mr. Crusher, make it so. Sir? Set course for the Lonka Cluster. Warp two. Aye, sir. Sir, at warp two we'll arrive at the pulsar in 31 hours. Thank you, Ensign. Engage. Aye, sir. We delay rendezvous with the Hood? We may have to. Lieutenant, inform the Hood. Aye, Commander. Belay that order. There'll be no further communication without my prior authorization. Commander, may I have a word? Mr. Data, you have the bridge. Aye, sir. You know I like to keep you informed as to the nature of our missions. If I don't, there's a reason. Not to keep you in the dark, but for the next few days, I may not be as communicative as usual. It may be difficult for you. Don't worry. I can handle it. And the crew? You can count on all of us, sir. I appreciate that, Number One. Picard, what are you doing? Showing our captors we possess intelligence. You don't think they know that? They hear us talking. They may not realize we are communicating through language. Capt Picard's letting them know we use mathematics. by tapping out the first six prime numbers. I know what he's doing. I'm trying to understand why. We must communicate with our abductors, find out what they want. Obviously, they want us. Obviously! But why? What makes our captors choose us? What makes us special? I couldn't say, Captain. I'm certainly not special. I'm just one cadet. And your best area? Impulse propulsion systems. I'm very good with field coils. Good enough to be useful? I don't know. Maybe. But if they needed an engineer, sir, why didn't they take a real one? Why pick a Starfleet cadet? That I can't answer. The Bolians are maintaining an uneasy truce with the Moropa, are they not? That's right. But this doesn't look like Moropa technology. Even assuming the Moropa wanted me, what would they want with you two? I've never even heard of the Moropa. My race has no enemies. None? In the last 300 years of Mizarian history, your planet has been conquered six times! We've survived by not resisting. Mizarians value peace above confrontation. You have no idea who did this? No. I can't think of anyone who bears malice toward my race. And against you personally? You suggest someone with a grudge has gone to all this trouble... I'm not suggesting anything. I'm merely trying to find an explanation. I'm sorry, Picard. I can't give you one. I'm neither important nor radical enough to hold for ransom. I'm a simple public servant. Nevertheless, Mr. Tholl... Stop! We mean you no harm. We are prisoners like yourself. We are not the enemy. Who has done this? We don't know. We were brought here, the same way you were. Our captors refuse to show themselves. I don't trust you. You must... trust us. We wish only to return to our worlds. Were you abducted from Chalna? You know my planet? Oh, yes. I visited there 1 2 years ago while commanding the Stargazer. Five and twenty. Ouch! If it's too rich, Geordi, fold. I'm thinking, I'm thinking. Enter. Counsellor, gentlemen... Forgive this intrusion. I was... just passing by. You are always welcome. I was wondering, Mr. La Forge. What's our engine-efficiency status? Operating at 93 percent, sir. That's very good. But I would like to increase that to 95 percent. I'll get right on it. That's not an order. You can get to it later. I don't want to disrupt your recreation. No, Captain, it's no problem. Lady Luck left me long ago. Care to join us? We have an opening. I'll observe, if you don't mind. Not at all. Counsellor, 20. Pair of threes. Flush, queen high. That beats my fours. Well played, Counsellor. Can I have a word? Certainly, sir. Forgive me, gentlemen. I'll return your player in a moment. Counsellor, I wanted to ask you about the crew. How are they reacting to our change in course? I sense no unusual reactions, Captain. Such change is hardly out of the ordinary. They're not curious or concerned as to why? They're curious, yes. But concerned? No, they trust you. How far does that trust go? Sir? I know, Counsellor, that the crew has always had full confidence in me. But... what if it were to change? Well, I'd inform you, sir, of course. Thank you, Counsellor. My given name is Esoqq. It means ""fighter"". I'll bet half the names in the Chalnoth language mean ""fighter"". Mizarians. Your names all mean ""surrender"". We are a peaceful race, a race of thinkers. A race of cowards. And you? I don't know your people. I am Mitena Haro of Bolarus IX. Who would want to imprison a child? I am not a child. Esoqq. I've been trying to determine if we have a common enemy. Someone with a reason for confining us here. There are Chalnoth who would kill me. But kidnap? There is no reason. You have many enemies? None of consequence. I've slain all the ones who mattered. That shocks you, Bolian? A little. And you? No, I'm not surprised. I know your race. You're uncivilized. You have no laws, no government. The Chalnoth have no use for them. We are strong. We obey no one. You live in anarchy, murdering one another. That mentality will get us killed. And you will be the first! This is getting us nowhere. Neither is asking useless questions. But if you must pursue the topic, how long have you and the Romulans been adversaries? For quite a while, Mr. Tholl. I could certainly entertain the hypothesis that our captors are Romulans. But what would they want with you? My brainpower, perhaps. It's known my species possesses superior intelligence. I'm among the brightest of my people. And the least modest. What is this? Food. The only food? It would seem so. Poison! Does this mean there's nothing for you to eat? You! Don't even think that. Picard! Don't let him. Esoqq. How long can you go without food? Three days,... perhaps four. No longer? No longer. All your tests indicate the same results. You are in great shape. I never felt better. I see. Then why did you come in? Your physical isn't for another month. Usually you remind me, badger me and finally order me to report. For once I thought I'd save you the trouble. Jean-Luc, be honest with your doctor. Are there any warning signs or symptoms you haven't told me about? As far as I know, I'm perfectly healthy. Well, then, return to your post. Have dinner with me tonight. In ten-forward? What about my quarters? More intimate. Jean-Luc, you are full of surprises today. I take that to be a yes. Picard, is it wise to attempt an escape? It's imperative. Why? Our captors haven't mistreated us. We've been kidnapped! Locked in a room. That's not mistreatment? They haven't hurt us, have they? I think we should just wait until we find out what they want. Be patient. We can't afford to be patient. Unless we act soon, Esoqq will starve. If we antagonize them, they may decide we're too much trouble, kill us and go capture another four. I agree that's a risk, but I see no alternative. Well, I refuse to help. As you wish, Mr. Tholl. We must get inside this panel. Not very sturdy. Stand back, Haro. The design is simple. Cross-circuiting the door mechanism should be easy. Make it so. Yes, sir. I think... I've got it. I warned you. Out with it, Jean-Luc. Out with what? Whatever has been on your mind all evening long. Has it been that apparent? How well you know me! After all this time, I ought to. Well, it's true. I have been preoccupied. I know that's not very flattering to you, but I've been thinking about us. And about the choices I've made. We both have made choices. And I've been wondering if they were the right ones. I feel we've allowed our positions to isolate us. Our positions necessitate a degree of professional detachment. But there's a danger in becoming too detached, of never permitting ourselves to get closer. Is that what you want, Jean-Luc? To get closer? You're a very attractive woman. And you're a very attractive man. But we both know it's not as simple as that. Would it be simpler if I were not your commanding officer? Simpler, perhaps. But that's not the only issue. I guess right now I'm comfortable with our relationship just the way it is. Would you care to dance? I thought you didn't dance. On special occasions. I don't think I told you, but I'm glad you're back on the Enterprise. I missed our friendship. I did, too. Jean-Luc, if I didn't know you better, I would think you were playing games with me. You're sorry you came tonight? I didn't say that. Good. Because I'm delighted that you did. But perhaps we should call it a night. Goodnight. I warned you not to provoke our captors. The next beams might be lethal. Not to you. You moved far from the door. Of course I did! Being stunned once was enough. You claimed you were hit by the stun beam before the rest of us arrived. You could be lying. Maybe our enemy is watching us. From inside. Are you accusing me of collaborating? Collaboration is what your species does best. You did try to talk us out of attempting to escape. For all we know, you may be our captor. Impossible. I'm a Mizarian. My people are not aggressive. How can we be sure you're a Mizarian? You could be an impostor. This is nonsense. What if you're an impostor? Esoqq was the last one to appear. He is the only one with a weapon. Keep talking and I will use it. Tholl, our captors have transporters, they have stun beams. It's hardly likely they'd hold us at bay with a knife. Then, maybe she's the impostor and set off the stun beams deliberately. I was hit, too! To forestall suspicion. You were very quick to volunteer. Tholl, I asked her to open the door. You ordered her. You've been giving orders, trying to make everyone do what you want. Tholl, what I want is for everyone to escape. Why should we believe you? Capt Picard's put his life at stake for others many times. The primitive culture on Mintaka Ill, the Wogneer creatures. And Cor Caroli V. Right. Helping to cure the Phyrox Plague. And how do we know this is the heroic Capt Picard? We have no proof of his identity. You wasted time with failed attempts to communicate with them or escape. Is that your task? To keep us busy so we're off guard? First Officer's log, supplemental. Although we're 18 hours from the pulsar, the Captain has ordered us to slow to one-half impulse. He has offered no explanation. I don't know why we're going to this pulsar. And why at half impulse? The Captain has given unusual orders before. I know. This is different. He's different. I can't put my finger on it, but I'm worried. The Captain does seem... detached from his emotions. Captain. Mr. La Forge. We are operating at 96 percent engine efficiency. Well done. Thank you, sir. When we arrive at the pulsar, I require everyone at their best. I know I can rely on you two. Of course. Excellent. An ale for me and for my officers. In fact, ales for everyone! Here's to the finest crew in Starfleet. Hear, hear. You know,... back when I was in the Academy, we would follow every toast with a song. I wonder if I can... Oh, yes. Come cheer up, my lads, 'Tis to glory we steer To find something new In this wonderful year To honour we call you As free men For who are so free As the sons of waves? Honourable, call our ships Jolly calls are our man We always are ready Steady boy, steady We'll fight and we'll conquer Again and again Come cheer up, my lads 'Tis to glory we steer... Commander, what's the Captain up to? That's not the Captain I know. We are on a mission that has no apparent purpose. In itself, I can accept that. All of us can because the Captain says it's important and we trust him. Then he runs the crew through unprecedented efficiency drills. But he says we need them, so we need them, because we trust our captain. But we also have a captain singing drinking songs with his men. He came to the poker game, too. And he was very odd with me afterwards. He wanted me to warn him if the crew was losing confidence in him. Any signs of mental stress or trauma? He came in for a physical with no word from me. Anything unusual, Doctor? Every test result identical to his last physical, which is kind of unusual in itself. As if to establish nothing was wrong. There was one other thing. He asked me to dinner in his cabin. It was a very unusual evening. Which brings up a very serious possibility. What if there's an outside influence at work here? I detect no evidence of telepathic coercion. Commander, there is one fact we have not considered. The abnormal energy in the Captain's room wasn't explained. Not enough evidence to justify mutiny. Nobody has suggested removing the Captain from command. Right now all we have are suspicions. Not enough to act on. The next move is his. Well, Picard, prove to us you are not the enemy. I can't. You're right, Mr. Tholl. Any one of us may be the enemy. And there is no way to prove that we aren't. But until we set aside our mutual fears and trust one another, we have no hope of escape. But how can we trust each other? She's right. There may be an enemy among us. And what if there is, Mr. Tholl? Shall we keep accusing one another until hostility leads to violence? Do we allow our suspicions to destroy us? Now, let's see if we can override this stun mechanism. Helm, take us in to 20 million kilometres. Aye, sir. Mr. Worf, divert enough power to the shields to offset radiation and magnetic fields. Sir, at 20 million kilometres our shields are only effective for 1 8 minutes. Noted, Mr. Data. Captain... ..may I have a word with you? You have the bridge, Mr. Data. Aye, sir. What is our mission? I'm under no obligation to tell you that. If you don't, you force me to take command of this vessel. On what grounds? Endangering this ship for no reason. No reason you're aware of. Not good enough. Your behaviour has been erratic. Erratic enough to justify mutiny? Do you really believe you have evidence to convince a board of inquiry? No, I don't. But I can't let you risk the lives of this crew. Number One, has it occurred to you that you might be the one with the problem? I'm aware you're under stress and I will let the matter drop if you report to sickbay for a full examination. Otherwise, I will have to relieve you from duty. Think about it. Cadet. I may have overloaded it, sir. Mr. Tholl! I still think this is a mistake. Now what? We're no better off than when we started. Captain, number four shield has failed. Increasing power to number three. Helm, move us closer. 1 0 million kilometres. Sir, the ship will not withstand the magnetic fields and radiation. We will not survive. Take us in, Mr. Crusher. Belay that order. You're relieved of duty, Commander. Mr. Worf, confine Mr. Riker to his quarters. Worf, that was an order. Maintain your position, Lieutenant. You're destroying yourself and anyone foolish enough to listen to you. You've shown none of the concern Capt Picard would for the safety of his ship, the welfare of his crew. Mr. Worf, escort Cmdr Riker from the bridge. Crusher, take us away from this pulsar. Heading 1 85, mark 32. Full impulse. Full impulse. Aye, Commander. Engage. I hope you're satisfied, Picard. You've accomplished nothing! The sound of your voice is beginning to anger me. Well... I think this charade has gone far enough. Don't you? I don't understand. Oh, yes, you do. This isn't a holding cell. It's a laboratory maze, a carefully structured test. It's an experiment to see how we react under pressure. How do you know? It's the only explanation. Look at the four of us. We do have something in common. We all react differently to authority. You, the collaborator, defer to whoever has control. You, the anarchist, reject authority in any form. I, a Starfleet captain, trained to command. And you,... ..a Starfleet cadet, sworn to obey a superior officer's authority. Our captors have placed us here and devised obstacles for us to overcome. They give us food, which Esoqq can't eat, to make him a threat. They give us a door we can't open until the four of us co-operate. And each time we succeed, they deal us reverses, to set us against each other again while you... ..observe our reactions. Sir, I've been trying to help. I found it unlikely that a cadet would know of the Enterprise's visit to Mintaka Ill, so I tested you. Starfleet has classified the Cor Caroli V plague as secret. No cadet would have knowledge of that incident. Captain... So you can drop this pretence. I'm quitting this game. As far as I am concerned, this experiment is over! You are correct, Capt Picard. To learn about alien interaction, we borrowed you, Tholl and Esoqq. We replaced you with replicas. Replicas? Our transporter replicates living matter, including where the brain stores memory. You mean there's a copy of me on Mizar II? An impostor running my ship? No longer. Cmdr Riker is now in charge. Our species is telepathically linked. We are all in continual contact. Much more efficient than your vocal communications. We would like to pursue this study but your awareness of it taints the results. We will therefore return you to your places of origin. Captain! Hold your positions. Take no action. Why did you choose to study authority and leadership? Because our species has no such concepts. We are all identical. There are no distinctions. We have no leaders, no followers. We wanted to investigate command. Our replicas of Tholl and Esoqq explored this on Mizar Il and Chalna just as our Picard replica did on the Enterprise. Your responses were intriguing. You have no right to put us through this just to satisfy your curiosity. Why not? Kidnapping is an immoral assault. The rights of other races must be respected. This concept of morality is an interesting human characteristic. We shall have to study it sometime. Now, Mr. Worf. What is it? Why do you hold us? Because there is something else you can learn. With an alert crew, even our primitive vocal communications are unnecessary. With a single look, I informed my crew I wanted to hold you here. But why? I'm conducting my own experiment. I want to see how you react to being imprisoned. Our species can't bear captivity. We were curious. We meant no harm. We did not injure you. Imprisonment is an injury, no matter how you justify it. Now that you've tasted captivity, perhaps you will reconsider inflicting it on others. In any event, we now know of your race. And we know how to imprison you. Bear that in mind. Now get off my ship. Mr. Crusher, set course to rendezvous with the Hood. It's good to have you back, sir. Status, Number One. Ship and crew functioning normally. Then my doppelgänger caused no serious damage? The replica was convincing? Very convincing, but not perfect. Not perfect in what way? Well, sir... I find it hard to believe you're that good a singer. Singer? I look forward to reading your report, Commander. At least, I think I do. Doctor. Captain. Course laid in, sir. Engage. "
S3E19,"Welcome to Risa. All that is ours is yours. We are looking for the lodging chamber of Capt Jean-Luc Picard. A file scan reveals no Capt Picard currently visiting Risa. When is he expected to arrive? There is no arrival date on file for any such individual. Could we have been mistaken? He will come. First Officer's log, stardate 43745.2. We have departed Gemaris V, where for two weeks Capt Picard has been mediating a trade dispute between the Gemarians and their nearest neighbour, the Dachlyds. Welcome back, Deanna. It's good to be back. The last two weeks have been gruelling. I take it the Captain was able to negotiate an agreement. He was. I don't know how he managed it. The Gemarians and the Dachlyds are incredibly stubborn. The more difficult the task, the sweeter the victory. Go to warp four, Mr. Bennett. Set course for Starbase 1 2. Report. Everything status quo, sir. Very well. If... ..anyone needs me, I'll be in my ready room. Sir! Congratulations. About what? About the trade agreement. Is it my imagination? Is something bothering him? He's been under a great deal of strain lately. While we were on Gemaris, he ate sparingly and slept even less. Anything we can do? I have a solution in mind, but I doubt he'll agree to it. What would that be? Our captain needs a vacation. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Come! Sir, one of the crew is neglecting his health again. How so? A classic case of stress-related ailments brought on by overwork. Exhaustion, irritability. Muscle spasms. Yet he insists on ignoring it. Doesn't sound serious. I plan on keeping it that way. What's the treatment? A week's shore leave. Impossible. I could make that an order. But you won't. Beverly, you know I loathe vacations. You loathe going on vacations. Once you're there, you have a marvellous time. You said your four days on Zytchin III were wonderful. I lied. Look... The Enterprise is spending a week undergoing a maintenance overhaul at Starbase 1 2. While there, I promise that I'll make use of available recreational activity. Watching a technician fill deuterium tanks is not my idea of fun. I could spend a few hours on the holodeck. Forget the holodeck! Isn't there someplace special you want to go? The Astrophysics Centre on Icor IX is holding a symposium on rogue star clusters. I had given serious thought to attending. The last thing you need is serious thought. Jean-Luc, go someplace beautiful, where you can relax and be pampered. You deserve it. I'll give it serious thought. Captain! Doctor, enough! Have you decided where to go? Yes, the bridge. No, your leave. Not you too! Halt. I know a perfect vacation spot. In fact, within the coordinates of this sector. How convenient. Except I have no intention of taking a holiday. Clear? Very clear. Glad that's straight. Resume. The place is called Risa. It is a paradise. Warm, tropical breezes, exotic foods. Nothing to do except enjoy the quiet. The women! Of course... Their sybaritic outlook is appealing. Sure... I'm glad to hear you say so. We're about to undergo extensive repairs, requiring my personal supervision. What about Risa? Some other time. Will, I've just had some terrific news. Really? There's an excellent chance my mother may join us on Starbase 1 2. Your mother? She is returning from a conference. She is going to rearrange her schedule to visit with us. That's wonderful. She mentioned she is looking forward to seeing you, Captain. Did she? Commander, a word. Is something wrong, Captain? Tell me, Number One. Is the entire crew aware of this scheme to send me off on holiday? I believe there are two ensigns who know nothing about it. So I'll get a week of continual harassment on this subject? I admit... I've been feeling a little fatigued. I'll see that these bags are beamed to your room. You look very handsome if I might say so. Are you taking all these books? Some light reading in case I get bored. Ulysses by James Joyce? Ethics And Sophistry In The Alternate Universe? Light reading? To each his own. Have I mentioned how imaginative Risian women are? Too often, Commander. I do have one request, sir. You want me to bring you a souvenir? A Horga'hn. I don't think you'll have trouble finding one. Consider it done. Captain, allow me to assign a security officer to you. We will be out of communication range. I don't think that will be necessary. Risa's reputation is of a peaceful planet. Aye. Well, the ship is yours, Number One. Enjoy your trip, Captain. I'll try, Counsellor. He'll have a great time. I beg your pardon. God, it's so good to see you again! I think you have mistaken me for someone else. You know, I think you might be right. Welcome to Risa. A simple handshake would've sufficed. Return. My apologies. I've yet to master the art of hover ball. So it would seem. My name is Joval. I'm employed here. Is there anything you require to make your stay more pleasant? You find me amusing? No. It's just that you are the fifth woman to ask me that. All I require is to sit in the sun and read my book. Alone. And afterward? I really hadn't thought that far ahead. Then may I suggest a swim and a massage? Some other time perhaps. I don't understand. You wish to be alone, yet you carry the Horga'hn. Well, I just purchased it. Why? Are you implying this has some special meaning? The Horga'hn is the Risian symbol of sexuality. To own one is to call forth its powers. To display it is to announce you are seeking jamaharon. Riker! Do you seek jamaharon? I don't even know what it means. The Horga'hn is for a friend. I see. Someone close to you? Right. Someone you love? I wouldn't go that far. Your attitude is most puzzling. I will leave you to your book. That is all I ask. You're blocking the suns. I know you're working with her. I warn you, it's a mistake. Are you addressing me? Don't bother to deny it. I've seen you together. I don't know what you are talking about. It's no concern of mine. Tell her I want the disc returned to me immediately. Perhaps I have not made myself clear. You have the wrong man. I am rapidly losing patience with you. I demand you talk business. You'll find Ferengi demands carry little weight with me. Obviously you've never dealt with my people before. On the contrary, all too often. Then you know we are not to be trifled with. Or trusted. You dare to insult me? I advise you to listen. I will not say this again. I came for a holiday, nothing more. I have no knowledge of this woman nor any disc. You expect me to believe such feeble lies? I don't care what you believe! This is not over yet, human! The disc is mine! And so is the woman. Remember that! Hello. It's you. That's not much of a greeting. Look. I don't wish to appear rude but I am not seeking jamaharon. Alright, but you really should try it sometime. If I try it, it will be at a time I choose. That's fine with me. I wasn't offering to help you find it. I... I assumed that because of the way you welcomed me... I'm sorry if I embarrassed you. I don't recall saying I was embarrassed. It's just I prefer to be acquainted with the women I kiss. That's understandable. The name's Vash. Jean-Luc Picard. Tell me about yourself, Jean-Luc. Would you rather I guess? I can be very persistent. I'm the captain of a Federation starship. That explains it. What? I noticed you arguing with that Ferengi. For a moment, it looked like it would come to blows. You're the woman he mentioned. I hope your disagreement wasn't over me. For that information, you'll have to ask him. Where are you going? To find privacy. Wait. What did he tell you? You said you didn't know her. I don't. I don't want to. Return the disc and all will be forgiven. The disc doesn't belong to you, Sovak. It would seem you have a lot to discuss. Jean-Luc, perhaps I could explain this to you later. Perhaps you can. I have a proposal I believe you'll find interesting. Save your breath. I'm willing to pay you your weight in gold in exchange for the disc. Is that not a generous offer? I must have that woman. What are you doing in my room? We are Vorgons. I am Ajur. This is Boratus. We come from the 27th century. We travelled 300 years into the past to find you. Alright, let's assume that I believe you, that you are indeed from the future. What is it you want from me? Have you heard of the Tox Uthat? What? I'm aware of the legend. It tells of a visitor... from the future... who left behind a mysterious device, the Tox Uthat. Essentially that story is correct. Then the Uthat actually exists? Yes. It was invented by a scientist, Kal Dano, in the mid-27th Century. The Uthat is a quantum-phase inhibitor, capable of halting all nuclear reaction within a star. But... why bring such a powerful weapon into the past? Criminals attempted to steal it so he fled back to the 22nd century. Ajur and I were the security team assigned to retrieve it. I gather you were unsuccessful? Yes. When we returned, we searched historical records for some clue to the Uthat's fate. Your search led to me? We came upon a brief account stating that you discovered an object of unknown origin, vacationing in Risa. From its description, a crystal fitting into the hand, we surmised it could be the Tox Uthat. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I haven't found anything. Including peace, which is the only thing I'm looking for. You will find such a device, Captain. To us, it is already part of history. And if I find it, what then? You will give it to us so that we may return with it. Well, the Uthat belongs to your time, not mine. May I come in? Excuse the mess. Sovak has taken to searching my room periodically. Is this what he's looking for? I'm sorry I had to hide it. I was afraid he'd start searching me next. This disc must contain some very valuable information. I doubt you would be interested. Depends. On what? On whether or not it has something to do with the Tox Uthat. Did Sovak tell you that? Let's just say I've heard rumours... that the Uthat is located somewhere on Risa. Look, the last thing I need is a partner. So, it's true. Have a seat. I don't suppose you ever heard of Professor Samuel Estragon. Yes, I have. He spent half his life searching for the Uthat. I served as his personal assistant for five years. Shortly before he died, he uncovered data pinpointing its location. And that disc contains his research notes and maps. And you're continuing his work? Exactly. With a Ferengi associate? Sovak and I definitely are not working together. But the two of you are... very well acquainted? Well, at times he aided the professor in his explorations, especially in situations that weren't quite ethical. Now, with Ferengi logic, he's convinced it belongs to him. All he cares about is selling it. Whereas you, of course, have a nobler purpose in mind. I told the professor I'd present it to the Daystrom lnstitute. First I have to find it. That won't be easy with Sovak watching me. I'll go in your place. What about me? You'll remain here. It's safer. Is that an order? Absolutely. This isn't a starship, Jean-Luc. I don't follow orders. I see. And you won't find it without me. The professor's notes are in code. From the moment I met you, I knew you were trouble. You look like a man who could handle trouble. So, where exactly is the location? It's about 27 km due east. There are some subterranean caves. That's where you'll find it. I'll meet you in the lobby in 1 5 minutes. Be punctual. And... I advise you change your clothing. Jean-Luc. We're going to make a wonderful team. I expected such treachery. Did you think you could sneak away from me so easily? The disc. Where is it? Didn't anyone tell you? No weapons. You're making a mistake putting your trust in this woman. It'd be worse to trust you. Silence! Do you know how she acquired the disc? Sovak! I paid her to steal it. But she betrayed me and used my money to make her way here. It didn't happen that way. She's greedy and unscrupulous. A perfect mate for a Ferengi. You're becoming quite annoying! As are you, Human! Perhaps I should kill you and take the disc. No, wait. You can have it. See, I told you we'd make a wonderful team. We've got a long trip. Have you calculated how much further we have to go? Another 11 kilometres. We should stay here. I was hoping you'd say that. Actually, we've... We've made better time than I expected. I'll take that as a compliment. As it was intended. Jean-Luc. I'm afraid I haven't been completely honest. Forgive me if I don't act surprised. Sovak did pay me to hand over the disc. So you did steal it? It wasn't stealing. The professor had died. I spent five years tracking down the Uthat. You took Sovak's money. It was the only way to get to Risa. Sovak got exactly what he deserved. Well, any woman who beats a Ferengi at his own game bears watching. I'll take that as another compliment. I'm flattered. Well,... we should get some sleep. You know, it's lucky for you we met. If it wasn't for me... If it wasn't for me, you'd be sitting in the sun, relaxing... That is why I came to Risa. I'm sure you hated it. That kind of vacation isn't for you. You need excitement. Excitement? Spending the night in a damp cave? Chasing after something we shall probably never find? You're enjoying yourself, aren't you? Yes. I just wanted to hear it. Good. Let's get some sleep. Your face, when you thought I was offering you jamaharon! That was a simple misunderstanding. You did seem a little disappointed when I turned you down. You are outrageous! Thank you. You're pretty stimulating yourself. Don't you see? We're a lot alike. That's probably why we get along well. Do you call this getting along? Fine. We don't get along. We're not getting along. I didn't say that. If you want to believe that we're not getting along... Still think I'm trouble? I'm sure of it. This is it. We've reached the end of our journey. Do you have the exact location? Seven metres from the opening along the wall. That should make it about here. What the...? Something wrong? I can't get a reading on this. There must be starithium ore in these rocks. That leaves us but one alternative. Shall we? Picard! A little premature. We are to be witness to a great moment, Picard. Who the hell are they? They are security officers from the 27th century. They're here to take back the Uthat. You knew about this and didn't say anything? I'm sorry. Would you have brought me if I had told you? Probably not. My point exactly. So... the betrayer is herself betrayed. You've put together quite a team. Do not interrupt the Captain. Quiet! How did you get here? I found the disc in her room. That's impossible! I made a copy but I burned it. Only the outer casing was incinerated. Now, I have no intention of interrupting you. Please... continue digging! No one told you to stop digging, Human. I see no reason to continue. Do it! Look about you, Sovak. By now it must be obvious, even to you. The Uthat is not here. Is this some pathetic attempt at trickery? Of course it's here! We simply haven't found it yet. Are you saying the professor's findings were wrong? It would appear so. But how? His evidence was overwhelming. Enough with this foolishness! Can't you see he's trying to deceive us? Return to work! I'm afraid he's right, Sovak. According to the disc, we should've reached it. Lies! Treachery! This cannot be happening. Not another failure. Not after having come so close. It is most puzzling. It's over, Sovak. No! I will not be cheated out of my prize. Tell him! Tell him the professor's research is irrefutable. I don't know any more. Then step aside. The Uthat is here! Somewhere. It's just waiting to be found. It can't hide from me for ever! Five years of my life... wasted. There will be other treasures to be found, Vash. Not like the Uthat. I hope you won't mind but... I need to be alone. Enterprise to Capt Picard. Picard here. Go ahead, Commander. We hope we're not interrupting anything important. We wanted to inform you we are orbiting Risa and are ready to beam you aboard. I'll be returning shortly. In the interim, stand ready to initiate transporter-code 1 4 at my signal. Transporter-code 1 4? You heard me, Number One. Sir. Picard out. Leaving so soon? Jean-Luc. I was just about to come say goodbye. Well, then... I've saved you the bother. I want to put this behind me as soon as possible. Understand? Of course. There's just one last thing you can do for me. Anything. Tell me where you've hidden the Tox Uthat. That's not funny. You never intended to burn that second disc. If you had, you wouldn't have allowed Sovak to salvage it. You wanted him to follow us, so that he could see that the Uthat wasn't at the cave site. That would convince him that your quest had been futile. But how could I know it wasn't there? Because you'd already been there once, probably the moment you arrived on the planet. That's when you found it. You're a man of many talents, Jean-Luc. A piece of the future. A very dangerous piece. Were you really going to give this to the Daystrom lnstitute? Well... Maybe not... give it. Five years is a huge investment, Jean-Luc. I deserve to make a reasonable profit. Congratulations, Picard. We knew you would not fail us. You're not going to hand it over? You didn't trust me. Why trust them? I assume the Vorgons can prove their claim. Our being here is proof enough. Wait a second. Vorgons? The professor's notes said that it was two Vorgons who attempted to steal the Uthat. For all we know, them! You're going to have to prove that you are who you say you are. You yourself said the Uthat belongs to the future. But not necessarily to you. You will return what is ours! No! Enterprise, code 1 4. Present coordinates. Two-second delay. Mark! Are you alright? Go. Return to your own time. There's nothing for you here. History recorded that you destroyed the Uthat. You have fulfilled your destiny all too well, Picard. Are there any openings for an archaeologist aboard the Enterprise? Somehow, I doubt you'd find life aboard a starship suitable to your taste. Probably not. I could never tolerate all that discipline. So... What are your plans? I thought I might explore the ruins on Sarthong V. Unbelievable! You are out of your mind! The Sarthongians are merciless to trespassers! Why, Jean-Luc... You really do care about me. Promise me. You will try and stay out of trouble. I always try. I wish we had more time together. Perhaps we do. The Vorgons are time-travellers. Now they know where and when the Uthat can be found,... ..they may well come back and try for it again. So we may be doing this all over again? Welcome aboard, Captain. Status report, Number One. All went well. You'll find the ship in splendid condition. I'll present my compliments to the crew. Oh, yes, Number One, about that Horga'hn you requested. Sir? You and I need to have a chat. Was it a relaxing trip, Captain? I knew he'd have a great time. "
S3E20,"Captain's log, stardate 43779.3. We are preparing exospheric charts of the Hayashi system, a tedious but essential step toward planet colonization. Captain, USS Hood is closing on an intercept course at high warp. Odd. We weren't notified of a rendezvous. They seem to be in an awful hurry. We are being hailed by Capt DeSoto. On screen. Sorry to sneak up on you, Jean-Luc. Robert! Why didn't you inform us? Out here, you never know who's listening. Keeps you on your toes. Hey, Will. Getting soft on board that luxury liner? So, old friend, how are you? Well, you know. They send you Galaxy-class boys to the far reaches. Me, I just haul my butt between starbases. But not today. No. Not today. Starfleet's got new orders for you. Top priority. They need the fastest ship and the best people. That is you. Why didn't they transmit the orders by subspace? They're worried about Romulan eavesdropping. And we have a passenger for you. Hard to send by subspace! What passenger? Mission specialist. He'll bring your orders with him. His name is Tam Elbrun. As in Tam Elbrun of the Ghorusda disaster? The same. What can I say? Your orders are to co-operate fully with him. Best of luck, folks. Hood out. The Hood is slowing to impulse. Mr. Data, come with me. May I come with you to greet Tam? You know him? He was at the university on Betazed when I was studying psychology there. I see. He was a colleague of yours. No. He was a patient. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Tam is a telepath of extraordinary talent, even for a Betazoid. He's a specialist in first contact with new life forms. He's very unique, but he's not what you might expect, Captain. Welcome aboard. I'm... Capt Picard, right? Here. You want to know about your mission. It's all on there. Orders and briefings, destination and heading, all that. Dee. I sensed you were out here. How have you been? Fine, but I thought... ..you were on Chandra V! Sir... Who...? What are you? I am Data. An android. Incredible. An android. I can't read you at all. It's like you're not there! Data? Hurry up to the bridge with that. The Captain wants you to scan the orders and be ready to brief him in ten minutes. Right? Number One. Riker here. Meet Cmdr Data on the bridge. He has our new orders. Aye, sir. And assemble the bridge staff for a briefing in 1 5 minutes. Picard out. Mr. Elbrun, would you... ..care to see my quarters? No. I'd rather do this briefing, then be left alone until I'm needed. I've heard about Ghorusda. Weren't 40 people killed? 47. Including the Captain of the Adelphi and two of my Academy friends. Sorry. Main bridge. So, what happened? It was a first-contact situation. Ghorusdan culture is so complex, they sent a specialist to prevent misunderstanding. Tam Elbrun. Was it his fault? Not directly. The board of inquiry blamed Darson for ""carelessness about Ghorusdan cultural taboos"". But if Elbrun was so good, why didn't he warn Darson? What was he doing there if he couldn't sense that much hostility? Our destination is the Beta Stromgren system, following the path of the Vega IX probe. 23 parsecs beyond our furthest manned exploration. That is correct. Apparently the probe has discovered... Astonishing. We are to proceed to this star, Beta Stromgren. Scientists have discovered it is in the final stages of collapse, and will soon result in a supernova. However, the unmanned space probe sent by Starfleet to observe the process has discovered much more. Data, don't waste time! They call it Tin Man. The Vega probe found it orbiting Stromgren. Looks like some kind of ship. Its energy source is unknown. Transmissions analysts think it's a starship. And they're sure... it's alive. Alive? How? Cybernetic organism like the Borg? No, no! Here. Starfleet believes it's an organic creature, born in space, living its life in the wastes between the stars. No one knows where it came from or why it's here. But we're going to meet it. We're going to talk to it. I'm going to talk to it. Have attempts been made... To communicate by subspace? Yes. Universal translation won't work. Tin Man is too different. Mind-to-mind is our only hope. The opportunity for discovery is extraordinary, but why the urgency? Romulans. Hell, I forgot. The Romulans. They claim that sector of space where Beta Stromgren is. They claim all that is in their field of vision. They routinely monitor the telemetry of our space probes. Then they will be sending a ship to investigate this Tin Man. No. Actually, they're sending two. Data? That is correct. Starbase 1 23 has detected two D'daridex-class cruisers on an intercept course. Their top speed is less than ours. Therefore we do have some advantage. Then... it's a race? An alien intelligence, a new life form, representing a technology beyond either the Romulans or ourselves. The Romulans will certainly take whatever measures are required to secure this creature for study. Study as in dissecting, I'd bet. Mr. Data, you are our resident honour student in exobiology. You will head up the Life Sciences on this mission. Aye, sir. Excellent. Meeting adjourned, then. So, Data, I guess you're the brains of this outfit, huh? Mr. Elbrun, one reason I'm asking that you work with a crew member is to avoid... further omissions. The possibility of an encounter with Romulans is hardly trivial. Yet... Alright, alright! I should have brought up the Romulans earlier, but I was... distracted. And no, Billy Boy, I wasn't distracted on Ghorusda. If Darson had listened to me, no one would have died! No? Well, I don't care whether you believe that or not! Captain's log, supplemental. We are still days from rendezvous with the mysterious entity Tin Man. My immediate concern is with Tam Elbrun. Starfleet considers him crucial to our mission, yet he seems to me... unstable. According to his medical records he's very high on the ESP scale. A sort of... prodigy. A prodigy? In what sense? Well, most Betazoids develop telepathic gifts at adolescence. You're not born reading minds? No. Except, for some reason that no one understands, occasionally a Betazoid child is born different. How different? Born with telepathy switched on. Most Betazoids born like that never lead a normal life. The noise of other people's thoughts must be overwhelming to a child. And painful. Early diagnosis and special training did help Tam adjust, but he has some problems. You mentioned a hospitalization. For stress. Repeatedly, throughout his life. I always wonder what holds one person together through that while another goes under. Yes, well, he's evidently done more than hold together. He's the indispensable man, the Federation's finest specialist in communication with new life forms. The more unusual the life form, the better he likes it. He's drawn towards assignments that isolate him from other humanoids. Cmdr Data, I'm picking up an unusual echo on my sensors. Something is out there, sir, tracking us, matching our speed. Something which does not fully register on our instruments. As no known natural phenomenon can travel at warp velocity, there are but two possibilities. Either it is a sensor malfunction or another ship is following us. It is not a sensor malfunction. Agreed. But if it is a Romulan ship, with their cloaking device, we shouldn't pick them up at all. Unless they're pulling power for something else and can't fully cloak. Like what? Ask the Romulans. If it is the Romulans. Lieutenant, continue monitoring the precise position of the echo. Any sudden change in its behaviour, initiate yellow alert. Aye, sir. Come in. How are things in the land of the living? I thought you might be lonely. No one sees you except Data. Lonely? I can hear everything that everyone on this ship thinks. And no one besides you seems to be missing my charming... You want them to dislike you. Why? Because I'm not a nice man. OK. Cos they scare me. They're too many minds. I can't shut them out. Never could. All their loves, their hates, their fears, their needs... It's like a tide that never ebbs. I could drown! I remember. You understood, at least a little, how I felt. I see you finally found a place to fit in. People to care about. And you're still looking. And then there's Ghorusda. I have enough doubt in my reliability without having to listen to Riker's and Picard's! What happened there? I thought everyone knew. No. What happened to you? Maybe I got too involved with the Ghorusdans, with their point of view. It happens to me. I wanted everyone to get along. I could have warned Darson more forcefully. So, after that you ran away. The last I heard, you were the only Federation delegate assigned to Chandra V. Beautiful creatures, the Chandrans! Their minds are glacial. They have a lovely three-day ritual for saying hello. Peaceful, untroubled people. Unlike humanoids. Well, except for your friend Data. I like him. He's... ..restful. I believe your impression of Data is probably unique. Yeah? Well, having to get to know someone, just once, has its appeal. I mean, talking to them, instead of getting it all at once, up here, whether I want it or not. But you accepted this mission. You could have stayed on Chandra V. You willingly came aboard a ship with over 1 ,000 people. How could I not? Think of it, Dee! This intelligence, that swims naked through space like a fish in the sea. Totally alien! Mysterious! Not like us at all. Ancient. And alone. So lonely for so long. How can you know that? You're in contact with it! With Tin Man. Aren't you? No. Well... Yes. A little. But not quite on a conscious level. We're light years away. That's impossible, even for you. Impossible for me. Maybe not impossible for Tin Man. Status? We're on course for orbital intercept with the Tin Man. ETA 1 8 minutes. Grand. Not altogether. The rate of the star's collapse has increased. It could go supernova in a few days. Captain, we're receiving data from the probe, including visuals. On screen. Magnify. Remarkable. Computer, locate Tam Elbrun. Tam Elbrun is in turbo lift one, en route to the main bridge. Of course. Our sensors are detecting a wave front of highly ionised particles preceding the object tracking us! Yellow alert. On screen. Romulan war bird closing. They are arming main disruptors. Red alert. Shields to maximum. Arm photon torpedoes and stand by. I thought you said we were faster than them. We are. But... Evasive. Hailing frequencies. I guarantee that they don't want to talk to you, Captain. The Romulan has passed us. Damage report. Casualties reported. 70 percent loss to the shields. Their attack on us was incidental, Captain. Incidental? To delay us! It would appear their intent is to contact Tin Man first at any cost. The war bird has exceeded maximum engine output by 30 percent, irreparably damaging their warp coils. They kept up by sacrificing their ability to re-enter Romulan space. One-way trip. There is one more trailing us. A day or two behind. Data's right. This one's job is to beat us to Tin Man at any cost! You read all this telepathically? In the mind of the Romulan Commander, during the attack. Very well. Mr. Crusher, all stop. Aye, sir. Cmdr La Forge. La Forge here. Geordi, how long to full shield-restoration? I'm working on it. Computer, reconfigure integrity power to feed inner deflector grid. Unable to comply. Request would compromise operational safety limits. To hell with the limits! Override. Authorization, La Forge 2997. Rerouting structural integrity power supply. Russell, watch the lateral grid balance. No, that's too much. We'll have to do it manually. La Forge to bridge. Go ahead. I'm feeding the grid by stealing power from the integrity field. You'll have a shield in 30 minutes. You have ten. Picard out. If the Romulans wish the honour of first contact, let them have it. You're insane! What if the Romulans find a way to persuade Tin Man... The chance of that is remote. And if you will be still, Mr. Elbrun, you may learn. What? That being first at any cost is not always the point. Mr. Data, while we wait I want Life Sciences and Engineering to continue collecting information on the alien. And query the Vega IX probe, long-range sensors. Aye, sir. You do a lot of your work here? Yes. I configured these instruments to display information more efficiently than stations used by the others. Nice. A little Spartan. Spartan? Lots of work space. Not much room to live. I don't guess you sleep? I have tried it from time to time. But you are correct. I do not require rest. But you paint! The creature's anatomy appears most peculiar. In what way? It is indeed laid out as a vessel with chambers and corridors. An internal environment suitable for carbon-based life forms, yet there is no evidence of a crew aboard. Tin Man is a living being which has been bred, or has adapted itself, to serve a purpose. I find that interesting. Why? Must living beings have a purpose? Or do we exist for no reason but to exist? I am not qualified to express an opinion. Data, you're uniquely qualified. You think a great deal about humanity. And you're an honest researcher. You don't treat anything as trivial. You want to try it all. You said earlier that you could not read my mind. True enough. But I think I understand you pretty well. It worries you that I can't read your mind? Perhaps there is nothing to read. Nothing more than mechanisms and algorithmic responses. Perhaps... you're just different. It's not a sin, you know. Though you may have heard otherwise. Captain, the Romulans are hailing the alien using their form of Linguacode. Response? Nothing so far. Why should it answer? What could it have in common with them? But you're so sure it'll talk to you! The Romulans are arming all disruptors. Take evasive action at the first change of Romulan course. In this position, we can't... No! No! We're not the target! It's Tin Man. What? Do they intend to destroy it? Those are their orders if they can't secure it. Increase speed to intercept the Romulan vessel. Their lead is too great, sir. Hail them! They won't listen to you! Danger. Gomtuu, do.. not... allow. Damage report. Nothing available yet, sir. We have partial failure of the main computer. It seems you woke your Tin Man. We've got power, but the warp engines have to go off line to recalibrate. How long? For everything? All of it. 20 hours, double shifts. We don't know that we have 20 hours. That star could explode at any moment. I know. OK, first thing we do is get the main computer working. Fix the shields first. Tin Man fried circuits I thought were unfriable. I'm not worried about Tin Man. It's more Romulans showing up. Right. First priority, get the shields up. Only no more surprises until I'm done, OK? Don't ask me about surprises. Ask Tam Elbrun. Your brain activity suggests you're coming out of some sort of seizure. Your blood pressure and glucose indicate general systemic stress. But I'm going to live? No doubt about it. Good. Because I want to know exactly what you did. I want to know how closely you're in communication with this alien and I want to know now! I... I... I just warned it, that's all. I've been in contact with it, sensing impressions. It calls itself Gomtuu. It's old, Captain. It's roamed the universe for many thousands of years. Where did it come from? Far away. Maybe beyond the galaxy. Once there were millions of them! Once? It hasn't seen another of its kind for millennia. It's alone. It may be the last of its species. Perhaps... we can help it in some way. Can you... ask it to return with us to Federation space? At least persuade it to leave the vicinity of Beta Stromgren before the star explodes? Captain, Gomtuu knows the star will go nova soon. That's why it's here. It wants to die. There was... ..an explosion. In space. Radiation penetrating the outer layers. The crew... The crew died. Such loss! Empty pain! Hollowness! Tam! Stop this! You're losing yourself in this merging! I know. Tin Man hurts and wants to die. I can't do any more from out here. If you want me to really reach Tin Man, I must be in physical contact. I have got to go aboard. No. That is out of the question. You don't trust me. No, Tam, I don't believe that I do. Tam, when you reached out to the alien, to warn it, did you give any thought to this vessel? To the danger, however inadvertent, that creature might pose to our crew? Or did you simply react out of instinct? Captain... Deanna. He's right. I don't know. I don't know what might happen. But if you don't let me go, we fail our mission. Besides, at this point, you need all the help you can get. Even Tin Man's. Russell, reactivate the sensor assemblies. OK, let's do a program reload, port array only. Good. That's good. Computer, run a level-two diagnostic. Port sensor array remains offline. Damn! Riker here. How's it coming? Not good. I think all the control processors are shot. But maybe if I swap the chips I can give you a minimum EM scan. Do it. OK, we're going to try starting retro sensor element 32 only. Are you in? Go. The good news is we have partial sensors. La Forge to bridge. Riker here. I'm picking up another echo on the sensor display. Are you reading that? Worf? One moment, Commander. Confirmed. Sir, the other Romulan ship on an intercept course. Geordi, how about those shields? I'm doing the best I can! But shields won't help if that star explodes. Data, you've developed an affinity with Elbrun. Troi, you've known him for years. How far can he be trusted? The issue isn't one of trust in Tam's intentions but in his judgement. He'll do what he believes is right. Of course. But his judgement... Is precarious. The stress of exposure to so many minds here is bad enough. Now he's strongly drawn to this creature. I'm afraid for him. Afraid of what? I sense that the alien is somehow calling him. If we allow him to beam over, I believe we will lose him to it, that he will lose himself. I agree that Tam's motives are trustworthy. I do not believe it is possible he will act against us or will cause Tin Man to act against us out of malice. If he breaks down over there we'll be no closer to accomplishing our goal. It would be a grave mistake. Thank you both. Data? I am puzzled, sir. We have come this far. Will you not allow Tam to fulfil his mission? Tam Elbrun warned Tin Man. The first thing it did was to destroy a space vessel. I understand. If you feel the risk is too great to send Tam Elbrun alone, then send me with him. Counsellor Troi understands him better. But he is more comfortable with me. It is humanity he is fleeing. I could serve as an intermediary, a bridge back. A reminder of his obligation, both to us and to Tin Man. Captain, the Romulan has uncloaked. Status? Shields are at 40 percent. We can manoeuvre on impulse. Phasers available on manual. Computer target-lock not functioning. Well, let's hope they're in a mood to talk. Hailing frequency. Open. Romulan vessel, this is Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. Enterprise, your presence here is a violation of Romulan space. You will leave immediately. We are not familiar with the terms of your claim on this sector. We are here for scientific research. Do you wish to participate? We have monitored the destruction of our sister ship by the star creature. We claim right of vengeance. We will destroy the alien. If you interfere, we will destroy you as well. Captain's log. A confrontation between the Romulan war bird and Tin Man is imminent. I have no alternative but to rely on the telepathic abilities of Elbrun. Picard to Tam Elbrun. Captain? Report to transporter room six. I don't... Cmdr Data will meet you there. Yes, Captain. We no longer have a choice. No. No! Too much. Too much! Tam? I can't! Data to Enterprise. Come in. No! Don't! If it is harming you, we must return. Enterprise, respond! No, it's alright now. Gomtuu was trying to communicate a lifetime to me in a few seconds, but I'm alright now. O'Brien to bridge. Go ahead, Chief. I have no transporter lock on them. Some kind of force-field went up. Confirmed. The alien has thrown up a shield, blocking all our sensors. Captain, the Romulans' weapons systems are now at full power! Follow them in. Red alert. Mr. Worf, arm photon torpedoes. Aye, sir. Yes. There is a large chamber 20 metres ahead. I know. I know everything now. Come on. Intriguing. This is the control centre where Gomtuu's crew guided their journeys. The ship and the crew existed symbiotically. They needed one another. When Gomtuu had no one left to care for, it had no more reason to exist. Is that the purpose of existence? To care for someone? It is for me. Deanna was right. I'll lose myself here. I must remind you that our objective is to bring Tin Man out of danger and report our findings to Starfleet. I'm not going back, Data. I'm staying here. Sir, the Romulans are hailing us. Capt Picard, if you interfere, we will fire upon you as well. We are prepared to defend the life of the alien. Shields up! Alien power levels increasing. The diameter of the star has decreased by 1 00,000 kilometres. It's beginning. Explain to them. Make them understand. But our mission... Is to save Tin Man. And I will. But he's going to save me as well. All my life I have waited for this. A chance to find peace. Finally, all the voices are silent. Only Tin Man speaks to me now. Don't you see, Data? This... is where I belong. That star will go any minute. The Romulans must know that, too. Power levels on Tin Man increasing beyond our sensor range. Conn, report. Dead stop, Captain. We've been thrown clear of Beta Stromgren, a distance of 3.8 billion kilometres! There is no sign of Tin Man or the Romulans, sir. Captain, on screen. Data! Sir? Data, what happened over there? Difficult to explain, sir. Tam? I believe he found what he was looking for. Supplemental log. With all main systems temporarily restored, we are proceeding to Starbase 152 for inspection and repairs. We have had no further encounter with the Romulans. As for the whereabouts of Tin Man and Tam Elbrun, we can only speculate. You sent for me? Yes, Counsellor. It was Tam's final request that I explain his decision to the crew. But I believe it was his hope that you would understand. What did happen? I witnessed something... ..remarkable. Individually, they were both so... Wounded? Isolated? Yes. But no longer. Through joining, they have been healed. Grief has been transmuted to joy. Loneliness to... belonging. You do understand! Yes, Counsellor. When Tin Man returned me to the Enterprise, I realized this is where I belong. "
S3E21,"I don't want any trouble here, Barclay. Why would there be trouble? Wherever you go, trouble follows. Lt Barclay, you're on duty. Is that a fact? It is and you'll observe it. So get back to your post. Look, pal, why don't you do me a favour? Take your holier-than-thou attitude and get out of my life. This is insubordination, Mr. Barclay. Here's to insubordination. Riker, you're nothing but a pretty mannequin in a fancy uniform. You're full of hot air. Picard has a problem with me, you tell him to come and talk to me himself. I feel your confidence, your arrogant resolve. It excites me. Lt Barclay, report to cargo bay five now. It'll have to wait till later, darling. I'll be right there! Save program. I don't know what to do with him. He's always late. He never gives his best effort, just slides by. I can't deal with it. How did he make it through the Academy? It's time we spoke to the Captain about Broccoli. That's what Wesley calls him. It fits. Commander, a broken seal. Better destroy it. The samples will be tainted. Is it a problem for you to report to duty on time? No, sir. I'm very sorry, sir. I had a very important communiqué, which required my response. I don't want to hear it. We have a problem with this antigrav unit. See what you can do. Mr. Barclay, I'm tired of seeing your name on report. I don't know about your last posting, but on the Enterprise, we set a different standard. Understood? Understood, sir. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, star date 43807.4. We're taking tissue samples donated by the Mikulaks for shipment to Nahmi IV, where they may help to contain an outbreak of Correllium fever. Everything looks normal to me. Computer, activate antigrav unit. Damn it! I don't understand. Engineering, I need more people in cargo bay five. La Forge out. We could use a hand, Mr. Barclay. I'll disassemble it later, Commander. It shouldn't do that. Well, I mean, of course it shouldn't do that. It shouldn't do that. I'm not accustomed to seeing an unsatisfactory rating like this. The question is if Mr. Barclay is Enterprise material. So, you've requested that he be transferred? I hate to say it, but I always thought I could work with anybody. But Broccoli makes me nervous. He makes everybody nervous. Broccoli? Young Mr. Crusher started that. I guess it's caught on. Let's get that uncaught. Indications are that he served competently in Starfleet for years. His ratings on the Zhukov were satisfactory. I recall Capt Gleason speaking highly of him before his transfer. I wonder if Capt Gleason wasn't buttering our bread. He knew that we needed an engineer. Barclay's psychological profile shows a history of seclusive tendencies. It was noted at the Academy. Yet he has made the same commitment to Starfleet that we all have. It's easy to transfer a problem to someone else. Too easy. Captain, I have tried. Try harder, Geordi. He's a member of your team. Try to find a way to help him make a positive contribution. Get to know the man better. Make him your best friend. With all due respect, my best friend? I can barely tolerate being in a room with him. I suggest you put your personal discomfort on one side. Dismissed. Yes, sir. Reg? How's it going? It's... I still haven't traced the problem, Commander. It's alright. No problem. I'm going to run diagnostics on the graviton inverter's circuits. Smart plan. I'd say we're in good hands. I'll give you a report... Whenever. ..before the end of the day. Fine. Fine. How about sitting in on the mission briefing in the morning? Me? I'd like your input. What on? Do you want me to prepare a...? No, no. Just be there. 0800 hours. I'll be on time, sir. Good. Good. Carry on. Morning. Start your brains, gentlemen, and let's do it. Anybody seen Lt Barclay? Not yet, sir. OK. OK. This trip to Nahmi IV is pretty routine, so we'll have time to realign the capacitors on both injectors. Duffy, Costa, that'll be your assignment. We can do the flow-regulator maintenance at the same time. Good idea. Ensign Crusher will be training with us this week. I'll assign him to you, Mr. Myers. Be sure and teach him the difference between impulse and warp drive. Lt Barclay has been working on the mystery of the antigrav failure. Your preliminary report had some interesting theories. Why don't you bring us up to speed on your findings? Yes. It wasn't a maintenance problem. Everything checked out. I'll look for a surge in the transfer coils. A coil surge wouldn't cause field dissipation. I realize that. Don't ignore possibilities, Wes. Check the flow capacitor. That could have affected the antigrav field. I was going to. Good. OK, let's take a look at that realignment procedure. I just didn't know what to say. What do you wish you had said? I should've told him to mind his own damn business! I knew about the flux capacitor. I didn't need to hear about it from a 1 7-year-old kid. You're letting this get you much too upset. You think so? Why are you so hard on yourself? You don't know. It's hard out there. I understand. But let go of it. You're here now. You're right, of course. Of course. Let me help you relax. I'd like that. I knew you would. That's nice. But I'm in the mood for someplace a little more unusual. Computer, run Barclay program 1 5. I am the goddess of Empathy. Cast off your inhibitions and embrace love, truth, joy... We should discuss different approaches. You didn't do anything wrong. It's just that Barclay's my new project. Broccoli's a real project! I need to draw him out. And I shut him down. Poor Broccoli. Pardon me, but why is he being referred to as a vegetable? It's a joke, Data. You know, a nickname? Nicknames generally denote fondness, a diminutive shared between friends. Data's right. The nickname stops here and now. Captain's orders. What the hell? What happened to your glass? Nucleosynthesis. The glass has been altered at the atomic level. Problem with the replicator? Unlikely. That would have affected the contents as well as the glass. The liquid was a synthehol replication of a light ale of Earth origin, which is what Lt Duffy ordered. I can't detect anything unusual that would have caused this. The glass probably had contact with an unshielded power source. That means a complete check of the power systems. All 4,000 of them. Do I have the perfect man for the job. Reg! Are you busy? I was just... No, not really. Why? I've got another mystery for you. Somehow the molecular structure of this cup has been altered. We need to check the power systems to see if a leak caused this. I had... I was going to do that. You were? Yes. To try to explain the antigrav unit failure. I still can't. Nothing about it makes sense. It's possible that these two incidents are related. This is minor, but it may be a symptom of a more serious problem. Should we go to a star base? Lt Barclay will check the power systems. Lt Barclay suggested a link between the two incidents. No, it wasn't... Not really. Will your investigation affect our available power? No. No, sir. We'll have to shut off some systems. We'll shut them down a few at a time. It shouldn't... I don't think so. Good. I'll look forward to your report, Mr. Broccoli. Barclay. If you'll excuse me. Metathesis is one of the most common of pronunciation errors. A reversal of vowel and consonant. Barc to Broc... Yes, I know him. He comes in, stands at the bar, doesn't say much. He orders a warm milk. Figures! Helps you sleep. You should try it. What's this to do with Barclay? I'm just trying to figure the man out. Do you ever talk to him? He doesn't talk much. Does he have any friends? Not that I've seen. What do you do with a guy like that? Well, I just serve him warm milk and let him be. I'm not so lucky. I can't let him be. He's my problem. Well, he's imaginative. How do you know that? I know. Then maybe he's in the wrong job. You engineering types don't appreciate imagination? That's not it, Guinan. He just doesn't fit in here. Terkim. What? Reminds me of Terkim, my mother's brother. Sort of the family misfit. Everybody told me to stay away from him. Bad influence. And did you? Are you kidding? He was the only one of my family with a sense of humour. No one stayed around him long enough to realize it but me. My mother says I remind her of him. I probably do. The idea of fitting in just repels me. Maybe I'm not making myself clear. Barclay, well, he's always late. The man's nervous. Nobody wants to be around him. If I felt nobody wanted to be around me, I'd probably be late and nervous. Guinan, that's not the point. Are you sure? Excuse me. Computer, where is Lt Barclay? Reg! Beverly? Good morning, my lord. Manners, my son. You embarrass me before our guest. Master Barclay will spank you if you misbehave. Wesley? What do you want? I guess I want Master Barclay. The boys got into another scrap, I'm afraid. Boys will be boys. You cannot withstand our assault forever, Barclay. You are outnumbered. Say you will yield. I shall speak with my sword. Where did you learn to fight like this? Self-taught, my capitaine. Shall I give you a few lessons? Who is that? One of your allies? Jean-Luc! Not that old trick. I'm very disappointed in you. I'll make it easy for you. I'll request a reassignment. Now, wait a minute. Look, the whole ship knows I just can't cut it here. Barclay. I've spent time in the holodeck, too. What you do in the holodeck is your own business. As long as it doesn't interfere with your work. You're not going to tell anyone about this? I don't think everybody would appreciate your imagination like I do. It is kind of unusual, recreating people you already know. Well, it was just... I needed to blow off some steam. One of the officers had been getting on my back. Let me guess. It was you. And I just couldn't tell you what I wanted to tell you to your face, so it just sort of got out of control. There's a part of this that's kinda therapeutic. You could talk to Counsellor Troi about it. When I'm in there, I'm just more comfortable. You don't know what a struggle this has been for me. I'd like to help, if I can. Being afraid all the time of forgetting somebody's name, not knowing what to do with your hands. I mean, I am the guy who writes down things to remember to say at a party. And then, when he gets there, winds up alone in the corner, trying to look comfortable examining a potted plant. You're just shy, Barclay. Just shy. Sounds like nothing serious, doesn't it? You can't know. O'Brien to La Forge. Go ahead. I need you in transporter room three. On my way, Chief. Listen, Reg, I really do want you to talk to Counsellor Troi. Troi? No. I couldn't. I mean it. As your friend and as your commanding officer. I was synchronizing the phase-transition coils, like I've done a hundred times before. The test object is pure duranium. Seems normal. Watch this. Glad I don't have anywhere to go. Chief Engineer's log, star date 43808.2. Analysis of transporter room three reveals no cause for the latest malfunction. This part of the same pattern? We don't know. None of the other transporter rooms are malfunctioning. Yet. We reach Nahmi IV in 22 hours. I want all transporters operational. I want a level-one diagnostic across the board. Have Mr. Barclay join us on the bridge immediately. Make it 1 400 hours. I've got him working on something. 1 400 hours. Mr. O'Brien, no maintenance until further notice. Aye, sir. I know this is difficult for you. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable? No. Have you been with a counsellor before? Yes... No. Which one? Yes. But she... It wasn't... It wasn't really a counsellor. Most people find a counsellor intimidating at first. It's OK if you feel that way toward me. Not at all. Good. Now, lean back, close your eyes. Why? I want to make you more comfortable. You do? Yes. It's OK. Close your eyes. What are you going to do? Just listen to the sound of my voice. Take a slow deep breath in through your nose... ..and let it out through your mouth just as slowly. That's better, isn't it? Much better. Oh, yes. Yes, that's much better. That is extremely helpful. Thank you for your time. But... In through the nose, out through the mouth. I'm going to practise that and I'll let you know. Thank you. I had a very strange visit from one of your officers today. Barclay? Yeah, I can imagine. Were you able to help him? To be honest, I'm not sure what happened. Where's Mr. Barclay? It's past 1 400 hours. Lt Barclay, report to the bridge. Lt Barclay, report! Computer, locate Lt Barclay. Lt Barclay is in holodeck two. I'll get him. No, I'll handle this. I've had it with him. Counsellor, you'd better come. Barclay's been running some unique programs. I don't care what he's been running. I just ran out of patience. Like I said, Barclay's been running some unusual programs. Crew members should not be simulated in the holodeck. There's no regulation against... Well, there ought to be. Computer, discontinue and erase. Belay that order. Counsellor? If Barclay is having difficulty facing reality, to suddenly destroy his only means of escape would be brutal and could do considerable damage. They are quite disagreeable, aren't they? Shall we have at them? Delighted. We shall thrash them. En garde! Stop it. Put that down. Your sword, sir. I don't have a sword. How do you expect to fight without your sword? I don't expect to fight. Do I detect a streak of yellow along the good fellow's back? Perhaps we should supply a more appropriate adversary. Number One! Number One! Here I come. Am I late? Did I miss the fight? En garde! You, sir, have a familiar bearing. Have we crossed swords before? Where is he? Where's Barclay? A personal grudge. I warn you, put your affairs in order before you meet him in combat. You challenge the greatest sword... In all the holodeck. You think this is funny? You are very tall. It might seem threatening. Mr. Barclay will learn how threatening. Computer, discontinue image of Riker. Sir! You have no sense of fair play. Tell us where to find Barclay. You want us to search for him? It could give us information about what's troubling him. A healthy fantasy is fine as long as it doesn't take over. You call this healthy? You're taking it so seriously. It's not without humour. I am the goddess of Empathy. Cast off your inhibitions, and embrace love, truth, joy... Oh, my God! Discard your facades, and reveal your true being to me. Computer, discontinue... Computer, belay that order. We want to see what's troubling this poor man, remember? Quite a healthy fantasy life, wouldn't you say? Report. Velocity increased to warp 7.25. Compensating, sir. Confirmed. Velocity now warp seven. Maintain that. What the hell happened? The matter/antimatter injectors locked for a split second. I do not know why. They are working normally now. Picard to La Forge. Go ahead. What's this injector problem? Well, sir, I'm in holodeck two. Another malfunction? Not exactly. I'll return to Engineering immediately. I think you should. Your holodeck activities can wait until later. And, Commander? Consult Lt Barclay on this latest incident. I'd like to very much. La Forge out. We need to find Barclay now. Cast aside your masks and let me slip into your minds. Muzzle it. We have a lot to talk about, Mr. Barclay. Barclay and I had better get to Engineering. Dismissed. I couldn't keep my eyes open. I'd worked 1 2 hours on the power systems and then the transporter went down. You had a chance to get help from the real Troi. Instead, you went back in there. I couldn't help myself. You could write a book on holodiction. I know how easy it is to get caught up in it. I fell in love in there. Really? But I knew when it was time to turn it off and say goodbye. The people that I create in there are more real to me than anyone I meet out here, except maybe you, Commander. I need you out here, Reg. Now more than ever. The injectors aren't responding to commands. I think we should drop out of warp. La Forge to bridge. Go ahead. Recommend we go to impulse power. Take us out of warp. Controls are not responding. It's the injectors. Override. It's not a computer problem. The mechanism is physically jammed. I can't clear it. Speed increasing, sir. Warp 7.6, 7.65. Warp 7.7. We can't shut it down, Captain. Antimatter flow is increasing. She's accelerating out of control. There is nothing I can do. Approaching warp nine, sir. Red alert. Estimated time to structural failure? At this rate, 1 5 minutes, 40 seconds, sir. Copy that, Geordi? Recommendations? I'll let you know as soon as we have some. This ship will tear itself apart in 1 5 minutes. I want ideas, no matter how outrageous. How about a magnetic quench? No. The magnetic fields won't reset. Are the fuel-inlet servos caught in cycle? No, the swirl dampers would be frozen. Nothing showed up in the diagnostic? The tests showed prob... I mean, there were no problems with the fl... There's nothing wrong with computer protocols or power systems. The injectors are just physically jammed! Injectors freeze, an antigrav unit and a transporter malfunction... And a twisted glass. What's the connection? Exceeding warp 9.4. Begin evacuation of secondary hull. Prepare for emergency saucer separation. Standing by to release docking clamps. Reroute power to primary hull. The plasma flow is uneven due to injector lock. A saucer separation could rupture the warp field. 1 2 minutes to structural failure. None of the systems involved are connected. What if one of us is the connection? Us? How? I don't know. But we're looking for a systemic explanation and there isn't one. We work with all the affected systems. What if we're transmitting something ourselves by touching it or something? The computer would pick that up. But if it was something that we couldn't scan, you might have passed it on to the injectors. It was your glass, Duffy. You were both there when the antigrav failed. So was O'Brien. The transporter malfunction is a connection. Danger. Approaching safety limits. Computer, list all substances that would evade a scan. There are 15,525 known substances that cannot be detected by scans. How many of those can exist in oxygen? 532. And could alter molecular structure when in contact with glass? Five. On screen at this station! Duffy. Jakmanite has a half-life of 1 5 seconds. No time to spread it. Right. Selgninaem and lucovexitrin are highly toxic. That leaves saltzgadum and invidium, which haven't been used for decades. Could either of them be the cause? Most of the affected systems weren't even invented when they were in use. Wasn't invidium used in medicine? A century ago. The Mikulaks might still use it. One of those canisters was broken. La Forge to bridge. We have a working theory. We picked up invidium from a broken canister and spread it around the ship. Working theory? We need a working solution in five minutes. Understood. We're checking cargo bay five. Nothing on the tricorder. Danger. Exceeding safety limits of engine containment field. Structural failure will occur in three minutes, 30 seconds. If it's in there, it should show up on one of the polarity channels. There it is. Duffy and O'Brien became contaminated. Invidium at minus 200 degrees Celsius becomes inert. La Forge to bridge. Invidium has been confirmed. Recommend we flood the injector pathway conduit with cryonetrium. Will the injectors come back on line? They sustained damage. I can't guarantee that we will regain control. We don't have much choice, do we? No, sir. Make it so. Route primary coupling through starboard conduit. Routeing. Ready for engine core injection. Structural failure will occur in 45 seconds. Injector conduit temperature, minus 1 00 degrees. Injector control to manual. Ready. Temperature now minus 1 90 degrees. Minus 200 degrees, sir. Injector status? Matter injector is on line. Antimatter injector still locked. Structural failure will occur in 30 seconds. Cycle power through ventral relay. Antimatter injector on line. Reducing flow capacity. Commencing warp engine shutdown, sir. Stand down from red alert. Nice work, Geordi. Mr. Barclay and I thank you, sir. Acknowledged. Recommend we set a course for Star base 121 for a complete systems- and bio-decontamination. Understood. Picard out. Glad you were with us out here in the real world, Mr. Barclay. It has been most difficult to reach this decision to leave you. But after discussing it at length with Counsellor Troi, I think it's for the best. I just wanted to thank you all for your support. You'll always be welcome here, Reg. I know. That's why it's so difficult to leave. It was a pleasure to serve with you, Mr. Barclay. Good luck, Reg. It's been fun. Computer,... ..end program. Erase all programs filed under Reginald Barclay. Except program nine. "
S3E22,"Captain's log, star date 43872.2. In order to neutralize a contamination of the water supply at the Federation colony on Beta Agni II, we are procuring 108 kilos of hytritium from the Zibalian trader, Kivas Fajo. Because pure hytritium is too unstable for our transporters, Lt-Cmdr Data has been shuttling the material to the Enterprise. Data to Enterprise. Go ahead, Mr. Data. This will be the last trip. The remaining cases are now being loaded. Acknowledged. Mr. Worf, advise Beta Agni II our departure is imminent. Aye, Captain. At warp six, we should be there in 1 6 hours. Loading is complete. I am now proceeding with departure. Enterprise shuttle bay two, prepare for docking. Level-one precautions for incoming material remain in effect. If you'll just acknowledge this last load, Commander. 26.8 kilos tripolymer composites. 11.8 kilos molybdenum-cobalt alloy. 1 .3 kilos bioplast sheeting. Shuttle twelve containment field reads nominal. Now leaving the Jovis. On viewer. Containment field stable. Gravitational fluctuations within acceptable parameters. Flight pattern. Data. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, supplemental. As the result of an unexplained shuttle explosion, Lt-Cmdr Data has been lost. Why didn't the field hold? Unknown. Hail the Jovis. I want Kivas Fajo. Sir, Mr. Fajo is hailing us. On viewer. Capt Picard, what happened? Unclear. We're running an analysis. We detected no malfunctions. Everything was running as smoothly as the other flights. Were you able to save the pilot? No. I'm sorry. I would like to analyze your sensor readings of the explosion. Compared to the Enterprise, our sensors are rather primitive. I doubt they contain any information your sensors overlooked. Perhaps, but I won't leave any avenue unexplored. I understand. We'll transmit the information. Link established. Receiving. Can we be of further assistance? How much hytritium did we get? 81 kilos. That will complete our mission but with no margin for error. Mr. Fajo, we have acquired your entire supply of hytritium. Where could we obtain more? The only source is in the Sigma Erandi System, Three weeks away. but who knows if they have any. For obvious reasons, no one wants to keep it around. Even I may stop selling it. It's just too dangerous. Then we're fortunate you had any. Transfer of information complete. Mr. Fajo... Thank you for your help. Mr. Crusher, set a course for the Beta Agni Il System. The Grissom is near Sigma Erandi, in case we need more hytritium. Thank you, Number One. Course laid in, sir. Engage. What am I doing here? Wondrous! The detail. The balance. Was I not right, Varria? What a remarkable piece of work. Why have I been brought here? The voice simulation, it's perfection. The inflections, the timing. It took... ..great effort... ..to bring you here. I was sure he'd be worth it. I am here against my wishes. I would like to know why. Certainly. You have been brought here for my enjoyment and my appreciation. Am I to infer I am your captive? Captive? That's such an... inappropriate description. My dear android... May I call you Data? It is my name. Data. You will be catered to,... ..fawned over, cared for as never before. Your every wish will be fulfilled. I wish to leave. Almost every wish. This is unacceptable. I have no desire to remain here. Even if I did, my Starfleet duties would not allow it. It's so... single-minded, isn't it? Very persistent. But it's very polite, a very nice touch. I decline to allow you to go. Then I am forced to attempt escape. Ten androids just like you might be able to force that open. But then again, there aren't any more like you. It's keyed to galvanic skin responses and DNA patterns. Sorry. Open it for me. Really, I wouldn't do that again if I were you. This is a proximity-actuated field. It impedes positron flow. It's bad for the brain paths in the long term. I fail to understand the value of my presence. Look around. There are items here gathered from half the galaxy. Right here. This is the very first Basotile ever created. Sorry. It's very, very ancient. Hundreds of years old. It's priceless. Come. This vase... This vase is made by Mark... ..the late Mark Off-Zel from Sirrie IV. Dali... This is the only known Roger Maris trading card from Earth. Circa 1 962. The smell? Bubblegum. I've preserved the scent! What? A lapling. I thought they were extinct. Extinct? Good. That is what is generally believed. She is the last surviving member of her species. They're defenceless creatures, really. Everything that you see in the room here, everything. One of a kind. Unique. All original. Just as you are. There. That is your place of honour. Sit, sit. Sit! You think it might be uncomfortable? You don't give that a thought. When Palor Toff learns of that, he'll swallow his tongue with envy! I can't wait to see his face! You are... the crown jewel of my collection. You are a treasure beyond comparison. Yes, go ahead. I think you should be flattered. I am not, sir. Most intelligent life forms find involuntary confinement offensive and inequitable. You have violated Federation law. I know what I've done is evil, selfish, immoral, unprincipled, illegal. I've learned to live with it. The Andorians wish to make a bid on the Tellurian spices. They've had four days to decide. Why do they have to decide...? I must emphasise, Mr. Fajo, that I consider this captivity a hostile act on your part. You'll get used to it. I can't believe he's gone. I always thought he'd outlive us. By centuries. He'd been working on this for months. He never felt it was quite finished. You know what a critic Data was about his own work. That was a gift from the Captain. And he should have it back. Those should go to Cmdr Riker. Data always fell for Riker's bluffs. These are some of Starfleet's highest honours. Not bad for a pile of circuitry and memory cells. You know... I keep going over the accident in my mind, trying to figure out what went wrong. I can see Data in the shuttle,... ..almost like I'm next to him, going through the departure sequence. What the hell happened? Why didn't I see it coming? What am I missing? Kivas wishes you to wear these clothes and to sit in your chair. I have no reason to accede to Mr. Fajo's wishes. He will give you reasons if you force him to. Mr. Fajo is deluding himself if he believes he can keep me. The Enterprise is certain to find me. They are not looking for you. They think you're destroyed. Your shuttle blew up. A hytritium explosion. They will scan the debris. They'll find what they thought they'd find. Traces of your component elements. We put them aboard the shuttle in just the right proportions. Clearly, Mr. Fajo has no moral difficulty with my imprisonment. Mr. Fajo has no moral difficulties at all. Do you? Clever, Android. Is it part of your program to seek out vulnerabilities in your enemies? Yes. Are you my enemy? I obey Fajo and so does everyone on this ship. Why? You are a curious thing, aren't you? You object to the question? Kivas finds ways to get what he wants from his people. His rewards for loyalty are lavish. His punishments for disloyalty are equally... ..lavish. You won't find anyone here to help you escape. Face it, Android. He has you. It appears... ..he has us both. The reason I can't find anything is there's nothing to find! I ran this analysis dozens of times. No indication of malfunction. No explanation at all? There's one. But I don't believe it. Pilot error. I know it's hard to accept but... Captain, it's not only hard. With Data, it's impossible. I can't even begin to calculate the odds. Well... If Data were here, we could ask him. What are you suggesting? I don't know, sir. It just doesn't make sense and I like things to make sense. Geordi, get a little rest and come at this thing fresh. Rest won't change the computer analysis. I'm sure you've done a complete investigation. If you wish to continue it, you have my support. But we will be reaching the Beta Agni System shortly and I expect you to be rested. I understand, sir. Dismissed. Geordi. I understand how much we want,... ..even need to explain an accident like this. Sometimes, there aren't any explanations. For an android with no feelings,... ..he sure managed to evoke them. We must select an officer to replace Data. Recommendations? Worf would be my first choice, sir. Mine as well. Make it so. ""He was a man, taken for all in all."" ""I shall not look upon his like again."" You are still wearing that uniform. Why? I am a Starfleet officer. You are not in Starfleet any longer. Adjust your program to accept reality. Even if I chose to, it is doubtful that my program could accede to your wishes. I have a fundamental respect for life in all its forms and a strong inhibition against harming living beings. What a marvellous contradiction! A military pacifist. Whose dreadful idea was it to enlist you in Starfleet? My skills seemed appropriate. Data, big mistake. A grievous error. You belong in Starfleet as much as I belong in a verbal contract! Tell me, have you killed yet? No. But I am programmed to use deadly force for defence. Shame on you! Shame on you! How neatly you rationalize your capabilities. How can you casually accept your role in murder? I would not participate in murder. Perhaps you misunderstand. Can't you see how much better it is here? The intellectual rewards alone. Our exploration of the galaxy. I am at war with no one. I am your liberator. You are a fine debater, sir. It is a pity you use your skills for hucksterism and your own greed. Perhaps you would not judge me so harshly if you knew of my youth... ..wasted, wasted on the streets of Zimbalia. Your past does not excuse unethical or immoral behaviour. No, it isn't true, anyway. My father was a wealthy thief. Data, why don't you put on these new clothes and sit on the chair? I must decline. You are going to be much more of a challenge than I first thought. Finoplak, a hundred denkirs. Data. In the meantime, here is something for your logic circuits to analyze. Don't worry. That solvent won't harm your... skin. But in seconds it will dissolve that uniform. I'd be delighted if you went around naked. I assume you have no modesty. But, then... ..l guess that decency is the rule of your Starfleet training. In any case, Data, why don't you make a decision... ..about which alternative you dislike the least? Make a decision by dinner. I have invited a guest. I expect you to be as entertaining as you have been with me. Warp six. Proceeding with departure. Enterprise shuttle bay two, prepare for docking. Level-one precautions remain in effect. I did miss something! See you later. Your first watch at Ops? I have served at the position before. I've been concerned about you. About me? Why? Because I know how I'd feel if I was asked to replace Data. Bridge! Promotion due to a death is commonplace on Klingon ships. I know. But this isn't a Klingon ship. Data was your friend. And it's the second time you've replaced a crewmate who's died. I honour Data's memory, as I did Lt Yar's, by attempting to perform their duties as well as they did. In true Klingon fashion. I appreciate your... concern. Computer, replace shuttle audio transmission, time index 0423. This is Data's second trip. Proceeding with departure. Enterprise shuttle bay two, prepare for docking. Level-one precautions remain in effect. Shuttle has cleared Jovis cargo bay. Sounds like the first trip. Exactly the same. That's protocol. That's Data. Following protocol to the letter. Computer, replace shuttle audio transmission, time index 0439. Third and final trip. Loading is complete. I am proceeding with departure. Enterprise shuttle bay two, prepare for docking. Level one precautions remain in effect. That's it. That's the last communication. He didn't report clearing the cargo bay. Of course, there was no reason to make voice contact. He knew we'd be monitoring his position. Any other pilot might not bother, but Data? Not following procedures? What do you think it means? He could have been busy. Maybe he saw something wrong. Without communicating it? That doesn't sound like Data. Which means that maybe something was wrong with him. But there's no other indication. Nothing he said or did during the entire mission. Wish I could talk to the last people he saw... I've added a Veltan sex idol to my collection. I've got four of them. What? With the pearls intact? Please! Pearls were added by Ferengi agents to increase the value. What is that? Something new, and you didn't tell me? Mr. Data, I'm delighted to see you have dressed for the occasion. Say hello to my very good friend, Palor Toff. Data, say hello. No need to be shy. It's a mannequin. It is not. This is Data. This is formerly Lt-Cmdr Data of Starfleet. The only sentient android in existence! It doesn't seem particularly sentient right now. It's playing a stupid game with us. Someone has certainly played a game on you. I don't find this amusing. I demand that you behave normally. Behave normally. I know you can hear me! He falls well. I apologize. Do not be upset. I'm having a delightful visit. Come along, Varria. You're much more fun than Fajo's new toy! You'll regret this. Now entering the Beta Agni System. Take us to half impulse, Mr. Crusher. La Forge to bridge. Go ahead. A Class-two probe, loaded with hytritium, is ready to launch. Now approaching Beta Agni ll. Mr. Crusher, put us into close orbit. Mr. Data, scan... My apologies, Mr. Worf. Scan the colony's subsurface water. Scanning. Tricyanate contamination confirmed at levels of 42 parts per million. Area affected? 30 square kilometres. Any indication of source? Highest concentration, eight kilometres west of the colony. Adjust coordinates. Aye, sir. La Forge to bridge, according to these figures, the 81 kilos of hytritium should neutralize the contamination. Now approaching target. Launch probe. Probe on target. Hytritium entering water table. Dispersement faster than expected. Sir, something unusual. Specify. I'm getting tricyanate readings of 70 grams per cubic centimetre at the source coordinates. Much higher than normal. Computer, report on geological instability. No significant geological activity has been recorded on Beta Agni Il since the settlement of the Federation colony. Number One, perhaps you'd better take an away team down. Aye, sir. Dr Crusher, transporter room three. On my way. Mr. Worf. I would very much like our relationship to... ..change. You may expect me to use every means at my disposal to resist. Why couldn't you just comply? Why do you argue all the time? Couldn't you sit on the chair? Come on. Go sit on the chair. I do not intend to. You will. You may not believe it right now but you will. Have you ever seen one of these? A disruptor. Well, no. It's a prototype for a Varon-T disruptor. The Varon-T disruptor is banned in the Federation. Oh, yes! They manufactured five of them. I own four. I sleep with one under my pillow and I sleep very well. Do you know why? It is lethal. It's not just lethal. It's... vicious. It tears a body apart, inside out, and does it very slowly, too, by your phaser standards. Tortuous. A very,... very painful death. I've always wanted to try this. It is doubtful you will destroy me since you assign so much value to me. That goes without saying. Please come in. Varria, how long have we been together, my dear? 1 4 years. 1 4 wonderful years, they were. She was barely an adult when I found her. She was idealistic, naive,... full of dreams. And I made those dreams come true. I'm going to miss you. Fajo. The contamination's been neutralized. The water's clean. Curious. The process should have taken several hours. Naturally-occurring tricyanate does not respond this quickly. Are you saying it's not naturally occurring? There are no natural trace elements in these tricyanate crystals. If it's artificial, it's sabotage. With tricyanate? That's hard to believe. It's slow to assimilate, difficult to replicate and hard to transport. There are a lot of easier ways to poison a water supply. More effective ways, too. Can you think why a saboteur would choose it? It might pass for a natural disaster. And since there's only one way to treat it, with hytritium,... ..maybe somebody figured we couldn't locate it. Then it really was lucky that we found hytritium when we did. And just enough hytritium for this crisis? Fajo was in the right place just when we needed him. Are you suggesting he created the problem? Possibly. To make a profit from its sale? It doesn't add up. Producing tricyanate is very expensive. He wouldn't make a profit, quite the contrary. Then why do it? What did he want? Computer, biographical file on trader Kivas Fajo. Accessing file, Kivas Fajo. A Zibalian trader of the Stacius Trade Guild, educated on Iraatan V. A noted collector of rare objects, including the Rejac Crystal, ""Starry Night"" by Vincent Van Gogh, the Lawmim Galactopedia, Moliam Andi tapestries... Computer, sufficient. A rare and valuable object? What if Data wasn't on that shuttle? Mr. Crusher, set course for the site of the shuttle pod explosion. The Jovis has a maximum speed of warp three. He's had 23 hours, so we can define a perimeter of 0.1 02 light years as his possible distance. Fajo doesn't know we're on to him. He probably isn't at top speed. He could have made it to the Nel Bato System or the Giles Belt. A trader doesn't attract customers by being hard to find. We could put out a coded query to all Federation outposts. Make it so. If I help you escape, will you take me with you? He's sleeping, and there isn't much time. The consequences... I know the consequences. 1 4 years. You learn a few things. There's an escape pod in the aft cargo bay. Captain, affirmative response from Station Lya IV. Fajo spent half a day in orbit. Departed seven hours ago. Mr. Crusher, new coordinates. Lay in a course for Lya IV. Course already laid in, sir. Perhaps I should contact Enterprise. You can't. Fajo has communications restricted to the bridge. Once out, the shuttle pod will emit an emergency beacon. We'll have to hope somebody responds before Fajo destroys us. I am trained in evasive manoeuvres. We'll need a few. Let's get going. As soon as I start the escape sequence, an alarm will sound. We won't have much time. It's your fault. You knew the price for disobedience. So did she. Well, there's always another Varria. You won't hurt me. Fundamental respect for all living beings. That's what you said. I'm a living being, therefore you can't harm me. You will surrender to the authorities. Or what? You'll fire? Empty threat. We both know it. Why don't you accept your fate? You'll return to your chair and sit there. You will entertain me and entertain my guests. If you don't, I'll simply kill someone else. Him, perhaps. It doesn't matter. Their blood will be on your hands. Just like poor Varria's. Your only alternative, Data, is to fire. Murder me. That's all you have to do. Go ahead. Fire. If only you could feel rage over Varria's death! If only you could feel the need for revenge, then maybe you could fire. But you're just an android. You can't feel anything, can you? It's just another interesting intellectual puzzle for you. Another of life's... curiosities. I cannot permit this to continue. Wait. Your program won't allow it. You can't fire. No. I'm reading a weapon in transit with Cmdr Data. It seems to have discharged. Discharged? I'm deactivating it. Welcome back, Mr. Data. Are you alright? Yes. Please arrange to have Kivas Fajo taken into custody on charges of murder, kidnapping, theft... The arrangements have been made. A Varon-T disruptor. It belongs to Fajo. Mr. O'Brien says the weapon was in a state of discharge. Perhaps something occurred during transport. Have you come to see me repent? Is this your final satisfaction? Want to see me beg for mercy? You're not going to get any of that. I expected nothing. Our roles are... reversed. Aren't they, Data? You're the collector now. Me? I'm in a cage. So it seems. I had you in my collection once. I can have you there again. Unlikely, sir. Your collection has been confiscated. All of your stolen possessions are being returned to their rightful owners. You have lost everything you value. It must give you great pleasure. No, sir. It does not. I do not feel pleasure. I am only an android. "
S3E23,"Captain's log, star date 439 17.4. The Enterprise has the honour of hosting the first meeting of the Federation with a mysterious race known as the Legarans. We are orbiting Vulcan, about to welcome Federation Ambassador Sarek. His wife Perrin, like his first wife, is from Earth. I studied his career in school. The treaty of Alpha Cygnus IX. The Coridan accession. The Klingon alliance. I met him once, very briefly at his son's wedding. I can tell you, it was a moment, standing in the presence of history. He spoke to me and I grinned like an idiot. You, tongue-tied? How do you make small talk with part of the Federation's history? And this is his last mission? Unofficially, that's what I hear. What a crowning achievement for his career. The benefits of relations with the Legarans are incalculable. Capt Picard. I am Ki Mendrossen, the Ambassador's chief of staff. This is Sakkath, his personal assistant. Has the Ambassador been delayed? He will join us momentarily. But first, we must discuss some matters of the utmost delicacy. Please go ahead. To be frank, Captain, the Ambassador is not young. He tires easily. He is going to need rest to prepare for this job. Which is why it is imperative that he conserves his strength. I must request that you dispense with any formal activities normally associated with a visitor of his rank. We had planned a concert this evening. I believe the Ambassador is fond of Mozart. It would be impossible for him to attend. Upon his arrival, he will go to his quarters and remain in seclusion until we reach Legara IV. You have my assurance that the Ambassador will not be disturbed. That's all we ask. Now that's settled, the Ambassador is waiting. Welcome aboard, Ambassador Sarek. We come to serve. Your service honours us. Allow me to present she who is my wife. Mrs. Sarek. Please call me Perrin, Captain. This is my first officer, William Riker. Captain, would you show us to our quarters? I prefer to view the conference room first. Ambassador, Sakkath and I can handle the necessary details. I will examine it for myself. Perhaps it would be best if we settled in first. They worry about my health, Captain. Too much. Take me to the conference room, please. If you'll follow me, sir. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. The Legarans will sit in this? I'm sure not. Can you believe this smell? What smell? What can I say? It's a slime pit, but to them it's home. Environmental controls ready. What's next? Are you in a hurry? Yeah. I have a date. A date? With who? Ensign Dumont. Really? She's very attractive. I gotta admit, I'm a bit surprised. What, that she'd go out with me? That you had the nerve to ask her. The room is not ready. No, Ambassador. Cmdr La Forge. Ensign Crusher... The Legarans are very sensitive in matters of protocol. You will remove the furniture. The walls must be bare. I'm sure everything will be set up before the Legarans arrive. Isn't that right, Captain? I assure you, Ambassador, everything will be ready before the conference begins. My husband and I have every confidence in you, Captain. I have worked for 93 years in preparation for this meeting. It is vital that no detail be overlooked. Perhaps we should allow these gentlemen to return to their work. That will be acceptable. These walls are too bright. The way Mendrossen described him, I expected a frail old man. I hope I'm that frail when I'm 202 years old. But his aides did seem a little overprotective. From what I could see, the Ambassador doesn't need protection. We'll respect Mr. Mendrossen's request and allow Ambassador Sarek his privacy. I suppose they were foolish and vain, my expectations of this voyage, sharing his thoughts, memories,... ..his unique understanding of the history he's made. Does this mean you are going to cancel the concert? It will go ahead. But it's a pity our guest will be absent. For all we know, he might enjoy some entertainment. Why not ask his wife to attend? An excellent idea, Counsellor. You have the bridge, Number One. Come in. I hope I'm not intruding. Not at all, Captain, but Sarek is in meditation at the moment. Actually, I came to see you. Well, how nice. I so rarely get visitors of my own. Usually, everyone wants to see the Ambassador. I find that hard to believe. Thank you. These quarters are quite comfortable. The Ambassador and I were pleased to hear the negotiations would take place aboard the flagship of the Federation. The honour is ours. My husband has taken an interest in your career. He finds it to be... satisfactory. My word! High praise from a Vulcan. Some people who expect an emotional response often find Vulcans cold, when they're merely being... Logical. Exactly. I came to invite you, and your husband if he's available, to a Mozart recital this evening. What a tempting offer. I doubt that the Ambassador will be able to attend, but I will make it a point to ask him. Then I hope to see you. As do l. You are still unable to meditate? It is of no importance. It has eluded you for weeks. I said it is of no importance. You know I am right. My wife, you will leave me now. I require solitude. The temperature in the tank is now 1 50 degrees. Lock it off. Is that it? Can I go now? What's your hurry? You don't really think anything will happen with Dumont? At least I'm not spending the night with a book! What's that mean? Just what it sounds like. You'd get more action out of a book than on this date. She won't waste time on someone like you. ""Like me?!"" She's out of your league. You, the expert on women. Compared to you, every male on this ship is an expert. At least I don't use the holodeck. What did you say?! You heard me! Something wrong? I asked a question. No, sir, nothing wrong here. May I be excused, Commander? Anything you'd like to talk about? No, sir. I notice that Worf has put Ensign D'Amato on report for insubordination. D'Amato is an exemplary officer. Indeed. Look into it. Good evening. Good evening. Work is progressing on the conference room? I checked in with Wesley and Geordi. There was a moment when I thought they would hit each other. Ambassador Sarek, Perrin, on behalf of the entire crew, welcome. It was my wife's suggestion we attend. An ideal diversion. Perrin can be quite logical... when she chooses. It seems the Ambassador had more time than I anticipated. Cmdr Data will be our featured soloist this evening. I am programmed to reproduce the individual styles of over 300 concert violinists, including Heifetz, Menuhin and Tataglia. Any preference? Tataglia would be lovely. I hope you find it pleasing. I look forward to it. At your convenience, Mr. Data. Please. Hi, Mom. You wanted to see me? I thought you were going to be at the concert. I said I may be going. Suzanne wanted to go to the arboretum. Capt Picard asked me where you were. I don't like making excuses for you. Excuses? It wasn't an official function. Listen, young man. You have responsibilities. Live up to them. Aren't you overreacting? Don't talk back to me. OK, I won't. Where do you think you're going? Away! And then I just slapped him. Really hard. I slapped Wesley. Do you know why you did it? I've never hit my son in his life. Beverly, this is important. What were you thinking then? I wasn't thinking. I was just angry. Wes didn't provoke you? It wasn't anything he said or did? No, that's just it. It was a sudden burst of anger. I still can't believe it. I don't know why you did it, but I've heard the same kind of story from ten different people over the last two days. This is your command centre? Yes. It is normally occupied by Capt Picard, Cmdr Riker and Counsellor Troi. Counsellor Troi is a Betazoid? Half Betazoid. Her father was human. Then, not a true telepath? Her skills are empathic. She is able to sense the emotions of others. What is Capt Picard's background in diplomacy? Extensive. The Captain's first diplomatic contact dates back... What about the Legarans? Could he conduct negotiations should the need arise? Do you foresee such a circumstance? less Ambassador Sarek unable...? Forgive me. I was merely exploring possible permutations of our mission. Your tour of the bridge has been most informative. Excuse me, we were sitting here. We're sitting here now. Come on, fella. This is our table. Really? Funny, I don't see your name on it. Didn't your mother teach you manners? Hey. Hey, guys. Is there some kind of problem here? There's a question as to whose table this is. Well, there are plenty of other tables. Right? I suppose so. Why don't I get everybody another drink, alright? I don't have to tell you that insubordination is a serious charge. I am aware of that. Ensign D'Amato challenged my authority. Is it my imagination or have tempers become frayed on this ship? I hadn't noticed. I see what you mean. Security. What the hell is going on? I wish I knew! Alright, that's enough! The next thing I know, somebody's left hook is on my chin. This is not an isolated incident. There have been reports of random violence all over the ship. You think this is contagious? No. I've tested for indications of a bacteria or virus. I've checked the water, food replicator, airborne samples. This is a hell of a time! Whatever it is, it mustn't affect the Ambassador. I want his quarters isolated until we've identified the cause. It's not that simple, Captain. We have determined that the outbreak of violence started at virtually the same time that Sarek and his party beamed onto the ship. We do have a working theory. We believe that it's possible that Ambassador Sarek is responsible for these incidents. Sarek? I felt something at the concert. Vague and undefined, but very disturbing. He cried. I saw that. I couldn't believe it. A Vulcan moved to tears by music? It's... Vulcans have the basic emotions we do. They've just learned to repress them. What I sensed was that he'd lost control. What would cause such a loss of control? There's a very rare condition that can affect Vulcans over 200. Bendii Syndrome. Early symptoms include sudden bursts of emotion, mostly irrational anger. Eventually, all emotional control is lost. I can imagine nothing more offensive to a Vulcan. Their emotional detachment is the core of their being. How would this affect others on board? Vulcans possess telepathic abilities. Sarek may unintentionally be projecting emotions onto others. At random. And when the Legarans beam on board? They could very well be affected. Is there a treatment? Can't someone else take his place? Sarek has built a personal relationship with them. They will accept no one else. How can we confirm your diagnosis? We can grow a culture from the tissue of the metathalamus. The results will take days. I have 1 2 hours. That's impossible, Capt Picard. I cannot delay the conference, not for a day, not for an hour. The schedule itself required three months of negotiations. Nevertheless... I give you my word of honour. The Ambassador is in perfect health. Is that enough? Mr. Mendrossen... You have a theory full of holes. Why am I not affected by Sarek's supposed condition? Perrin. How could his wife function normally if this theory is correct? I cannot explain that. Hundreds have not been affected. I have not. It appears to be random. Proximity, apparently, has no bearing on this phenomenon. You are accusing the greatest man of his time of losing his mind on the eve of his greatest triumph, and you cannot explain why. I won't report this to the Ambassador, for the moment, so as not to divert his attention from the mission. But if I were you, in the interests of your career, I'd be very concerned about finding the real cause of these outbursts before the Legarans arrive. Mr. Data, report to my ready room. Aye, sir. Capt Picard is not satisfied with Ki Mendrossen's assurances that the Ambassador is in good health. Do you consider Sarek capable of carrying out his mission? Have I given you cause to think otherwise? You have voiced certain reservations about his abilities. I do not recall making such a statement. Not directly, no. But you did question me about the capabilities of both Capt Picard and Counsellor Troi. I am honour-bound to help Sarek carry out this mission. That is the only answer I can give. Then you must decide which is your greater obligation. Your loyalty to Sarek or your duty to the Federation. Can you accept the logic of continuing this mission? Tell your captain... ..the mission is in jeopardy. Sakkath has been able, until recently, to use his telepathic skills to reinforce Sarek's emotional control, containing the effects of his deterioration. He hasn't done a good job. The strain of this mission on Sarek has made it impossible. It's ironic, isn't it? All this magnificent technology and we still find we are susceptible to the ravages of old age. Loss of dignity,... ..the slow betrayal of our bodies by forces we cannot master. Do you still want to be one of us? It is conceivable, even for me, that time will eventually lead to irreparable circuit failure. But one thing I do not understand. Sarek is a logical, intelligent being. The effects of Bendii Syndrome are apparent. Why would such a man ignore them? Logic fails us sometimes. I think this is one of those times. I can only guess he does not, or does not wish to, see the truth. He is being insulated against it by those who love him most. Someone has to confront him. Not a task that I look forward to. Everyone is protecting Sarek. His wife. Mendrossen. Even you. What would you have me do? March down there and destroy him? The mission cannot be carried out with Sarek in this condition. I know! Then tell him. Don't you tell me what to do! Captain. Commander. Of course. You're right, Number One. It's a task that I will attend to. Captain, I don't think I understand what you're telling me. My husband is responsible for your crew assaulting one another? He is very ill, Perrin. Bendii Syndrome is more a folk tale than a disease. There hasn't been a true case in my husband's lifetime. There's one now. Sakkath knows. Sakkath? Sakkath knows nothing my husband didn't teach him. He knows. And more than that. On this mission, he has held Sarek's mind together as well as he could. That is not true! I must see Sarek. Captain, I know a good deal about the Vulcan mind, and I know about the heart of one particular Vulcan. I am his wife. He is fine. He does not have Bendii Syndrome. That is the end of it. I'm sorry. Please. You mustn't do this to him. Must not do what, my wife? If Capt Picard wishes to see me, he may do so. I regret that we have seen so little of each other during this voyage. The loss is mine. Captain, may we talk in private? You were speaking of your belief that I suffer from Bendii Syndrome. I have been accused of many things in my life, never an excess of emotion. Sarek, I see no reason to continue this discussion. On the contrary, I wish to assuage any fears the Captain may have regarding my capabilities. I believe there is a test for Bendii Syndrome. I will take it immediately. The results would not be available for several days, which is why I must ask for a postponement of the conference. That would be a mistake! Captain, I give you my word, I am in perfect health. Then... ..why must Sakkath help to contain your emotions? Is what the Captain says true? No, Ambassador, absolutely not. Perrin, were you aware of this? Sakkath, I await an answer. I have been using my limited abilities to strengthen your mental discipline. Your efforts will no longer be required! That would not be wise. It may not be wise but it is necessary. Leave me. I wish to speak with Capt Picard. Sarek. I ask you to reconsider. Obey my wishes. There is nothing to fear. I hope I have not embarrassed you. You seem to forget, I am a Vulcan. I am not affected by emotional considerations. I think you are affected, sir, far more than you realize. I am a logical being. Present your arguments. I will listen. There is an epidemic of violent incidents aboard the Enterprise. As we speak, the situation is worsening. It is your hypothesis that I am the cause of these? Yes. My chief medical officer has explored all other probable causes. I share your concern. However, you must agree it is not unusual for a starship to encounter unexplained phenomena. That is correct. Since I assure you I am not the cause of your difficulties, the logical course would be to have your doctor continue the search. She is. It is also a fact that these incidents began shortly after your arrival. Is your entire argument to be based upon mere coincidence? Is it a coincidence that your wife and your staff are isolating you? I believe I see the flaw in your logic. You are reacting to their overprotective attitude towards me. They are somewhat emotional concerning my age. Surely Sakkath cannot be influenced by emotion? Am I to be blamed that Sakkath is young and inexperienced? He erred in his assumption that I needed help! You needed him at the concert. Or is there some other logical explanation for what happened? What happened? I saw you crying. I do not cry. I saw the tears. You exaggerate, Captain. I recall only one tear. So, you were emotionally affected? That is not possible! You still haven't answered my question, Sarek. Is it logical for a Vulcan to cry? It was late. I was fatigued, nothing more. The Legarans trust only me! They will not meet with anyone else. I must be allowed to complete my mission! There are no other logical solutions. No other logical solutions? There are always solutions. You have said so yourself. I meant... Sarek would never be afraid of something he did not want to see. Your efforts to discredit me will not succeed. Sarek would never confuse what he wanted with the truth. I will not be spoken to like this! Do I hear anger in your voice? It would be illogical. It would be illogical! Illogical! Illogical! Illogical! Captain's log, supplemental. In three hours time, we are scheduled to meet the Legarans. However, it is now all too evident that Ambassador Sarek cannot proceed with the conference. We're in the Legaran System. Should Mr. Worf contact their ambassador? No. I will present our regrets to the Legarans personally. It's vital they understand our reasons for cancelling negotiations. Captain. I think you did the right thing. But at what cost, Number One? Come. Perrin. I must speak with you, Captain. I'll be on the bridge, sir. How is the Ambassador? Resting. I've come to ask you to reconsider your position. You know that is impossible. Sarek is a good man. He's given the Federation a lifetime of service. I beg you to let him keep the respect he has earned. He'll never lose that respect. Mendrossen and I didn't want to deceive you. The condition came on gradually. It was easy to delude ourselves and pretend nothing was wrong. We convinced ourselves that he could complete this one last task and end his career with dignity. Help him, Captain. Help him regain his pride, his honour. Believe me, it would give me great pleasure, but there is nothing I can do. The mission can be saved. But he needs your help. A mind-meld. Between the two of us? Do you realize the dangers involved in what you are proposing, Captain? Yes, I do, Ambassador. But I also realize the potential benefits. We would be linked telepathically, sharing our thoughts, becoming, in essence, one mind. Which for a few hours should provide the emotional control you need. In that time, you can meet with the Legarans and conclude the treaty. It is a generous offer. But I must warn you... ..that while I would gain your stability, you would experience the fierce onslaught of emotions unleashed by my condition. Vulcan emotions are extremely intense. We suppress them. No human could control them. They would overwhelm you. The mind-meld can be a terrible intimacy. I cannot allow it. I'm aware of the risks. But it is the only... ..logical solution. Your courage honours me, Captain. I can't say I approve of this. I didn't expect that you would, Beverly. I don't suppose I could stop you. I'm afraid not, though I do admit to a certain trepidation. Your... Your company is much appreciated. Come. I see that you are ready, Captain. Doctor Crusher will monitor our responses. A sensible precaution. My mind to your mind. Your thoughts to my thoughts. The Legarans are ready to beam aboard. Very well. Number One. Please inform the Legaran delegation that Sarek of Vulcan is on his way to welcome them. Yes, Ambassador. I take it the mind-meld was a success? All went as planned. Is Capt Picard alright? Don't worry, Number One. And the Ambassador? I am myself again. It has been a long time. No! It is... It is... ..wrong. It is wrong! A lifetime of discipline washed away, and in its place... Bedlam. Bedlam! I am so old. There is nothing left but dry bones... ..and dead friends. Tired, so tired. It will pass, all of it. Another hour or so. Just hold on. No! This weakness disgusts me! I hate it! Where is my logic? I am betrayed by... ..desires. I want to feel. I want to feel... everything. But I am a Vulcan. I must feel nothing. Give me back my control. Buried. Amanda... I wanted... to give you so much more. I wanted to show you such... ..tenderness. But that is not our way. Spock! Amanda... Did you know? Buried. Can you know... ..how... ..much I love... you? I do... ..love you! Beverly. I'm here, Jean-Luc. I'm not going anywhere. It's... quite difficult. The anguish of the man. Despair... ..pouring out of him, all those feelings,... ..the regrets. I can't... stop them. I can't stop them. I can't! I can't. Don't even try. First Officer's log, star date 43920. 7. Ambassador Sarek has concluded the negotiations with the Legarans. The USS Merrimack has arrived and will transport the Ambassador and his party to Vulcan. I hope your journey on the Merrimack is uneventful. With these pressures behind him, I believe I can help him maintain control until we return to Vulcan. What will happen then? The effects of Bendii Syndrome are irreversible. Medical research is always continuing, of course. Mr. O'Brien, stand by for transport. Aye, sir. Thank you, Captain. He loves you... ..very much. I know. I have always known. I will take my leave of you now, Captain. I do not think we shall meet again. I hope you are wrong, Ambassador. We shall always retain the best part of the other inside us. I believe I have the better part of that bargain, Ambassador. Peace and long life. Live long and prosper. "
S3E24,"Captain's log, star date 43930. 7. The Enterprise is in attendance at the biennial Trade Agreements Conference on Betazed. For the first time, the Ferengi are present. I reluctantly consented to their boarding for the closing reception. Check and mate. Perfect. The queen's gambit finished off with the Aldabren Exchange. That is unfair. I couldn't concentrate with that noise. Noise? It's Algolian ceremonial rhythms. A toast to the success of the conference. I must admit,... ..l had some doubts about the Ferengi. They made a profit and behaved. Still, they trouble me. We Betazoids are uncomfortable with species like the Ferengi whose minds we can't read. Perhaps your telepathy is ineffective owing to the anomalous construction of the Ferengi brain... Thank you, Mr. Data. It was thoughtful of you to invite Lwaxana Troi. Lwaxana and I go way back. Her first husband was a friend. I've known Deanna since she was a child. I'm sure Troi appreciates having time with her mother. Little one, pretend you are happy to see me. Mother, we're among non-telepaths. It's impolite not to speak aloud. You mean talk with my mouth full? Deanna, please. Alright. You want me to say something aloud? Have you considered if you had stayed on Betazed, you might be happier? Let's not guess what might have been. I love my work on the Enterprise. Yes, of course, but it's all business and no play. You've got to enjoy life, relax. Like I do. Find the right man, think of your future. Think of mine. Lwaxana, Deanna. Anything I can do? Could l...? She's as repulsive as the rest. Repulsive? I find her exotic. What an advantage her telepathy would be in our negotiations. To read our competitors' minds? Yes, that would be valuable. But she'd never agree to use her powers to help us. I'm not so sure. Lwaxana Troi of Betazed, I believe. I am DaiMon Tog of the Ferengi vessel, Krayton. May I join you? I was going to see Capt Picard. Excuse me. Jean-Luc! Have a drink with me. Tell me what you've been up to. Perhaps later. Mr. Data and I were about to show Reittan Grax the... ..the new door mechanisms on the turbo lifts. Excuse us. Lwaxana Troi. I desire you. What? Your Betazoid skills would be very useful to me. I find you very attractive. I am willing to pay handsomely for you. I don't believe this. You must be aware that every female has her price. Let's get one thing straight, little man. I am not for sale. And if, by some chance, I were to become available, I would rather eat Orion wing-slugs than deal with a toad-faced troll like you. Go away. Find somebody else to become your property. As you wish. Now that you've totally humiliated us, may we return to our vessel? She is exhilarating, isn't she? Now I want her more than ever. Lwaxana Troi, you will be mine. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Are we at war with the Ferengi? DaiMon Tog returned to his vessel. The Ferengi have left orbit. My mother will be relieved. I hear she handled the situation skilfully. An admirable woman. I'll be sure to tell her you said so. Come in, little one. Mother? Mother, please. After that awful Ferengi insulted me, I needed to centre myself. Can you imagine that creature talking to me like that? Doesn't he realize I am a daughter of the Fifth House of Betazed? Holder of the Sacred Chalice of Rixx? The Sacred Chalice of Rixx is an old clay pot with mould growing inside it. One day, when you're older and wiser, you'll understand. Come on. Sit down. Talk to me. We spend so little time together. That's true. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get so upset with you at the reception. Deanna, try to understand. You're all I have. My only concern is for your happiness. I am happy. Why can't you believe that? I wish I could. How much happiness is there in always being there for someone else and never for yourself? I get a lot of satisfaction out of my work. I'm sure you do. I'm sure it's rewarding in its way, but... What about a family? This is my family! My friends here on the Enterprise. Alright. In case I have to spell it out, I am talking about finding a husband, having a child. That's what made me happy. At least, until now. Mother, look. Perhaps someday I will marry. But you have to let me make my own choices, live my own life, not the life you want for me. You had your chance with Cmdr Riker. Look how you ruined that. I did not ruin anything. We've become very good friends. All the better. You wouldn't want to marry an enemy. I see we can't talk about this. Very well. Have it your way, little one. Little one? You called me that when I was five. Now stop demeaning me and address me as an adult! I'll be home on Betazed if you need me, little... Deanna. Adding pre-processors to the neutrino-counters boosted efficiency. Cmdr La Forge and Cmdr Data did it. But reprocessing the data with an optical chip was your idea. Correct. Cmdr La Forge and I designed the chip, but Mr. Crusher derived the equation for its operation. He completed the upgrade early. Impressive. Indeed. Fine work. We shall miss you, Mr. Crusher. Examination scores from Starfleet Academy have arrived. Congratulations. When you've completed the oral, you will be formally admitted. You'll go to Betazed to meet up with the transport ship. Thank you, sir. That'll be all. Number One, a moment. Yes, Captain? You agree that this is a routine mapping mission? Yes, sir. Counsellor Troi asked for shore leave. I can see I shall have to suggest it to you. Have a good time, Number One. Your mother! It's around here somewhere. Maybe it died. It has been a few years. Muktok live for hundreds of years. Here it is. It's lovely. I remember that sound. And all the good times we had. I remember a certain junior officer meeting a very serious psychologist. The best part about being assigned to Betazed. This is the perfect spot. Put the food down over there, Mr. Homn. Isn't it a beautiful day for a picnic? They'll join us in a moment. No. Put the food over there. Mother, how did you know about this place? Your father used to bring me here. Sit down. You even brought provisions. Very thoughtful. Here. Will, Deanna. Try an oskoid. They're delicious. That sap running through the veins helps keep it warm. Very tasty. Last time we met, you were looking for a husband. Any luck? Alas, no. But what happens to me isn't important. I am more concerned with other people getting on with their lives. Mother. Mr. Homn, I noticed some uttaberries back along the path. Pick some. Well, Mr. Homn and I could go if you would like to be alone. It's such a romantic setting. Mother, stop it. Darling, you have been so excitable lately. Have you thought of some leave? I could talk to Jean-Luc. Try the oskoid. Very different. What the...? For one whose beauty surpasses even these pericules. DaiMon Tog, I thought the Krayton left orbit. It did. But when I tried to get Lwaxana Troi out of my mind, I could not succeed. This is ludicrous. You came back to Betazed for me? Why continue to search for perfection once you have found it? I don't believe this. Now, look, Demon Tog! I'm a daughter of the Fifth House, holder of the Sacred Chalice of Rixx. Unless you want an interstellar incident, beam back to your ship. Returning is what I had in mind. Krayton, transport four immediately. No! Pawn takes knight, king's level. Bishop takes knight, king's level. Rook to queen four. Lwaxana? Deanna? Where are we? From the smell, I'd say we're on a Ferengi vessel. They can't do that. You're Starfleet officers. Tog must not have read that chapter on etiquette. Enterprise? Must be too far out of range. DaiMon, they have regained consciousness. Very good. I should have known. Even their transporters can't be trusted. Why remove our clothing? Females do not deserve the honour of clothing. They're as bad as humans. Look at that leer. No. His is an expression of revulsion. But it is a feeling that I do not share, Lwaxana. It's cold in here. Do you want me to become ill? You must forgive the doctor. He is not accustomed to Betazoid females. Now, Lwaxana, I have a business proposition for you. Thanks, but I'm not interested. Hear me out. Your telepathic powers could bring us both profit. Why would I want to bring you profit? In order to keep your daughter alive and healthy for one. There is no need for threats. Lwaxana is a sensible female. I don't like this. I believe I can control him, little one. I'm sure that we can talk about this. Just the two of us. A wise choice. Farek, leave us. And you may rejoin your friend. Mother, are you sure? I'll be fine. Now, Lwaxana Troi, let us talk. 1 5 hours from Gamma Erandi. The subspace static is playing hell. Just what you'd expect from a stellar nursery. Congratulations on passing your written examination. An excellent achievement. Thanks. If I do as well on the orals... You will, and we'll be gaining the best ensign in the fleet. There is no guarantee that Wesley will be on the Enterprise. 91 percent of graduates are not posted to Galaxy-class starships. I never thought of that. I assumed I'd come back here. I'm sure Capt Picard will request you. That is, if he's still commanding the Enterprise when you graduate. I never thought of that either. I never thought I'd feel this way about leaving you. Is that not the human experience? Growth and change. I suppose so... Listen, Wesley. I felt the same way, but it was the best time of my life. You're gonna meet new friends and have adventures. I hope you're right, Geordi. Little one, Tog's given me something hideous to wear. He says it flatters my beauty. So far, Mother's in no danger. I hope she knows what she's doing. She's bought some time. Let's make the most of it. I wouldn't do that. I don't need your help. You're two moves from being mated. See? You should have listened. Now you've only got one escape. That wasn't it. Should have moved the bishop. Ridiculous! It was pinned. Don't listen to me. Forget that I beat you in 30 moves. Pure luck. I was being polite. I could have won in 20. Then prove it. Pawn to queen four, king's level. Pawn to king's bishop three, queen's level. I must admit, when you first approached me, I was intrigued. You mean revolted. Perhaps a little. Do you forgive me? Yes. With your powers, we could be a formidable team. My! You have great strength in your hands. You like that? I've always admired strong males. You are beautiful. It is impossible for me to resist you. Then don't. Initial scans of ionisation patterns complete, sir. Now correlating sensor readings. Almost incomprehensible. The amount of energy being expended. Actually, it is 5.34 times 10 to the 41 st watt, sir. Well within the norm for this. Yes. Perhaps, Data. But that takes away none of the wonder. Check. I'm sick of this game. Of course! Now that you are losing. Who's losing? I'm tired of standing. You can't resign now. It's hard to play. I can't see the board. Ah! Then you will finish the game if I let you out of the shell? I might. Clever, human! But I'm not foolish. You think I'd escape? Where would that get me? You've got her. Where would I go? I do not trust you. Fine. Thanks for the game. Come out here. Now save your rook, if you can. And that was my first husband. Not much of a conversationalist, but... ..what a lover! Well, then I met... I do not want to hear about your other romances. It makes me jealous. My, my. What big ears you have. Has anyone ever told you how attractive they are? Some females think they are my best feature. No one has ever given me oo-mox like this. Oo-mox? There is no translation. But the ear is one of our most erogenous zones. Those Ferengi have iron jaws. Little one, if Tog were a kitten, he'd be purring. Good work, Mother. According to Mother, DaiMon Tog is extremely relaxed at the moment. Tell Lwaxana to keep him relaxed while we call in the cavalry. Access denied. All transmissions to be authorized by DaiMon Tog. Let's see just how relaxed DaiMon Tog is. Mother, we're trying to contact the Enterprise. We can't do it without Tog's access code. Could you... ? Say no more, little one. Lwaxana, you and I are going to make such a wonderful team. With your telepathy and my cunning, I foresee... A very profitable future. Interference is subsiding. Communications have been restored. Good. Contact Cmdr Riker on Betazed. Message coming in from Betazed, sir. Priority one. On screen. Capt Picard, at last. We have been trying to reach you. Our communications have been blocked. Is there a problem? I'm afraid so, Captain. Lwaxana, Deanna and Cmdr Riker have disappeared. I knew I wanted you when I saw you. You have fulfilled my expectations. How sweet. Farek thought it was a bad idea, but I knew better. How clever. I knew best. I always know best. How repugnant. What? I said, ""How romantic."" I can't resist a man who knows what he wants. That's me. That's why I am DaiMon of this ship. I take charge in every situation. More to the left, woman. Whatever you say. My darling, care for a drink? You're so attentive. Does your food synthesizer know how to make an Arcturian Fizz? I don't think so. They have certain pleasure-enhancing qualities. Let me teach your computer how to make one. I'll need your access code. Yes, my beloved. Computer, access code. Tog! Be silent. I knew you were not to be trusted. I was going to make a drink. Save your lies for this fool. But... Don't listen to him. He's misunderstood me. No, Tog. You have misunderstood. You have been tricked by a sly female who finds you repulsive. She was only trying to serve me a drink. You almost gave her complete access to the ship's computer. A security breach severe enough to cost you your command. It's time you took my advice. Let me study her. Study her? Your mind probes could kill her. You brought her aboard for her telepathic powers. If I can determine what neural configuration gives her those powers, I may be able to duplicate them. We could still profit. I don't know. A true DaiMon would not be blinded by lust. Give her to me, or I may be forced to report your transgressions. Very well. Take her. When you have finished here, survey in that direction. I wish I had some answers. Mr. Homn was no help? None. He last saw them in this clearing. When he returned, all three were gone. Lt Foley discovered this in the pond. The species is Zan Periculi. It is not indigenous to Betazed but to a Ferengi world. Now we have a reasonable hypothesis as to whom. The difficult question is where? The Ferengi ship is fast. She could be anywhere. Cmdr Riker will assume we are searching. He'll send us a message. Monitor Ferengi subspace frequencies. Mr. La Forge, can you extend our sensor range? If I narrow the band and tie the sensors to the subspace scanners. Make it so. Do you wish to leave orbit? Not until we have someplace to go. I've done everything. It's no use. Without Tog's security code, I can't get near their system. We are running out of time. Farek is about to begin the neural scan. Maybe I'm going about this in the wrong way. If I pick a minor subsystem, something non-essential... Like this. Warp-field phase adjustment. All this does is suppress the subspace interference. Meaning what? If I set up an oscillation, I can send a signal to create a message the Ferengi will think is just subspace static. What's wrong? Mother. Will, we have to help her. Thanks for your help but you'd better get aboard the Bradbury. Soon as I'm sure this works. Initiating scans now, Captain. Can you locate the Krayton? Ferengi transmissions are scrambled and encoded. Without a code, we can't identify any specific Ferengi vessel. Ferengi codes are near impossible to break. Gentlemen, I have confidence in your ability to perform the impossible. Captain, the Bradbury can no longer delay their departure. Mr. Crusher. Now. No lengthy farewells. Good luck. Thank you, sir. The repetitive nature of the subcarrier pattern implies... Deck six. Wesley? Take care. You too, Mom. Something the matter? We've been scanning Ferengi transmissions to locate the Krayton. One of the signals was, I don't know, familiar somehow. Something in the message? No. The message was scrambled. It was the static! Where are you going? Captain. The Bradbury has informed us they can no longer wait for Mr. Crusher. Wesley! There's a pattern to the interference in the Ferengi message. You will miss the Bradbury. The interference could be a message. If I could hear a replay of the scans. Signal the Bradbury. They may leave. Play back the transmissions. Wait, repeat that one. Put it on continuous replay. Hear that popping noise? Can you filter out everything but that sound? Cochrane distortion. A fluctuation in the subspace field. All warp engines generate that interference. But listen to the pattern. It's that Algolian ceremonial rhythm. Mr. Crusher is correct. There is a temporal correlation. Then it is a signal from Cmdr Riker. Ingenious. He selected a signal that the Ferengi would dismiss as static. Signal source located. Plot an intercept course. Course plotted, sir. Well done. Warp eight. Aye, sir. Engage. Get away from her. What are you doing? Stand off, Commander. DaiMon Tog, can't we strike a bargain? All I am concerned about is my daughter's safety. What happens to me isn't important. What are you suggesting? Let me be candid. Deanna is of no use to you. She's only half-Betazoid. If you keep Riker, Starfleet will never stop chasing you. Release them. Release them and I will stay with you willingly. I'll even use my telepathy to aid in your negotiations. A tempting offer. I would like to believe you. The offer is genuine. I give my word as a daughter of the Fifth House. Lwaxana, don't. I've made up my mind. I can't let you. William, I am a grown woman. Mother, we can't just leave you. Yes, you can and before he changes his mind. Please, little one, do this for me. Just this once. Do we have an agreement? I give you my word. I will release your daughter and the Commander. DaiMon! A Federation ship approaching at high warp. The Enterprise has found us. Slow to impulse. Raise shields. Inform the Enterprise that two of our guests are ready to return. The other will be staying with us at her request. I must protest, DaiMon. Lwaxana has given her word. Oo-mox is only the beginning. Are you both alright? None the worse for wear. My mother bought our freedom. She doesn't want to stay with Tog. Hail the Krayton. Frequencies open. DaiMon Tog responding. On screen. Capt Picard, so good of you to meet us. We were on our way to Betazed to return our guests. Of course you were. But you're still holding Lwaxana Troi. When will you realize that it's over between us, Jean-Luc? I think I know what she is doing. Fight to get her back. Open. It's not over between us, Lwaxana. You're mine and I will not let you go. I insist you return to my side immediately. You mean, you still care? ""My love is a fever."" ""Longing still for that which longer nurseth the disease."" Tell me more. ""In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes, for they in thee a thousand errors see, but 'tis my heart that loves what they despise who in despite of view are pleased to dote."" ""Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?"" ""Thou art more lovely and more temperate."" You didn't tell me that you and Picard were... You said you didn't want to hear about my other romances. I have a new love, Jean-Luc. You can't keep killing all my lovers. That has to stop. Killing? He's insanely jealous. Listen, Tog! I must possess Lwaxana. If that means destroying your ship, so be it! Captain, I had no idea Lwaxana... Don't let him threaten you. You can defeat him. The only way you'll get me back is over Tog's dead body. That can be arranged. Mr. Worf, arm phaser banks and photon torpedoes. If Lwaxana is not in my arms in ten seconds, throw everything you've got at the Krayton. But you will destroy Lwaxana. ""When I have plucked the rose, I cannot give it vital growth again."" ""It needs must wither."" Nine, eight... ""Tis better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all."" Seven, six... No, wait. Five, four... Beam her to their bridge now! Two, one... You wonderfully jealous fool, you. Captain, I trust there will be no further action taken against us? Such as my reporting this incident to your superiors? I will think about it. Screen off. Thank you, Jean-Luc. You were most convincing. You certainly convinced me. I am grateful that you risked your life to save my people. I'll have you home in a few hours. That won't be necessary. I'd just love to hear more of your poetry. Perhaps another time. Please. Mr. Crusher, set course for Betazed. Warp nine. Come. You wanted to see me? I've contacted the Admiral. He regrets your missing the exam, but hopes you will reapply next year. I understand, sir, and I do intend to reapply. The Academy's loss is our gain. The Enterprise will continue to benefit from your talents. Thank you, sir. Is that all? No. Is there something wrong, Captain? I'm just thinking that I'm saying goodbye to you as you are today. But I thought you said I can't go. The Academy must make you wait, that's true. But when I review your service to this ship, your crew mates, I cannot, in all conscience, make you wait for the Academy. You see, Wesley,... ..in my eyes, you're an acting ensign in title only. I hereby grant you field promotion to full ensign with all the responsibilities and privileges of that rank. Congratulations. Dismissed. Lwaxana Troi has beamed down to Betazed, Captain. Notify Starfleet we are en route to rendezvous with the Zapata. Aye. Ensign Crusher, take us out of orbit. Set a course for Xanthras III, warp factor six. Aye, sir. Course is set. Engage. "
S3E25,"Captain's log, star date 43957.2. We are charting an unexplored star system in the Zeta Gelis Cluster. This routine assignment has made for a quiet time aboard the Enterprise. That's her. Which one? The one on the right. Don't stare! Why not? Because she'll see. Good. You must let her see the fire in your eyes. But what would I say? Words come later. It is the scent that first speaks of love. Thanks, Worf. That helps a lot. Hi, Geordi. Hi. So, how have you been? Good. I... How are things down in Engineering? Fine. They... They've been fine. Well, I'll see you around. I have much to teach you about women. Mr. La Forge, report to transporter room three. What's this all about? A one-man spaceship crashed on the planet. We picked up life signs, humanoid, faint and fading. Radiation levels within acceptable limits. We can beam him out into sickbay. He's not stable enough. His brain stem's damaged. Autonomic functions failing. His heart needs neurofeedback. It can't regulate itself. I need a volunteer. Right here. I'll hook up your nervous systems through the tricorder. Your brain will regulate both systems. That'll stabilize him long enough to get him to the ship. Take deep breaths. If anything goes wrong, I'll break the connection. OK. Geordi! I'm fine. No problem. Transporter room, three to beam directly to sickbay. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Autonomic still low. Begin cardio stimulation. 60cc of inaprovaline. Massive infection is setting in. Use the protodynoplaser to stabilize. We need to design a virus that will boost his ATP production. What about Cmdr La Forge? He's waiting. Give him a full bioscan for any residual effect from the neurolink. Keep his arm in cryogenic stasis until he's strong enough for surgery. The wreckage appears to be an escape pod. A damaged control system probably caused the crash. An escape pod? They can't have travelled far. Mr. Data, any other signs of ships in the area? There is a scattering of debris around the planet. Refined metals and other synthetic compounds. Remains of a larger vessel. He must have left before it was destroyed. Sensors show elements in the debris indicating phaser fire was exchanged. Did you salvage anything else? That's all that's left on their computer. Can you access it? It will take time, sir. Downloading will require fabrication of a matrix translator to emulate their computer. Keep me apprised of your progress. Aye, sir. Limb refusion appears to be successful. Tissue oxygenation is within norms. That's all we can do for now. We can't test neuromuscular function for a few days. Geordi. Can I go now, Doc? No need to keep you. Your bioscan is negative. Could've told you that. I feel great! How's your patient? I never thought he'd make it this far. Major trauma to his head and chest cavity, massive plasma loss, severe damage to most organs. What are his chances? I believe he'll live. I'm afraid I can't take the credit for it, though. His body seems to have amazing recuperative powers. The damaged tissue is repairing itself at a phenomenal rate. One thing troubles me though. What's that? Take a look at this. Cell regeneration. Yes. The thing is, it has nothing to do with the injuries. These are undamaged cells that seem to be mutating. Do you have a theory? No. I've never seen anything like it in my life. There is a possibility that it's part of his natural healing process. I hope it is, because there's nothing I can do to stop it. There's got to be some way to decode the information in this thing. I agree. But the data matrix within the capsule does not match any standard format. All we have determined is that the device contains a chemical system for energy encoding. But the computer can't analyze the specific chemicals. It must be part of a data-processing system. What if it's a feedback-loop controller? The shape suggests rapid chemical processing and storage capacity. We found it near the escape pod's instrumentation. It might process the ship's dynamic motions and augment its control inputs. Let's send it test signals. Make it think the assemblage is operating. An intriguing experiment. It might give us information without having to decode the storage medium. We should examine your theory. Less talk, more synthahol. We came here to relax. I am relaxed. In fact, I've never felt better. But you know, Worf? You're right. The storage capsule can wait awhile. See you. Christi, you're not leaving, are you? I was just on my way down to the arboretum. Would you care for some company? I'd love some. I didn't think you were interested. There are a lot of things that you don't know about me. I've been tutoring him. He learns very quickly. Medical log, star date 43958. 8. I have removed patient John Doe from the emergency biosupport unit. In just 36 hours, most of his organ systems have regenerated themselves to the point where they can now function on their own. I am alive? You certainly are. Thank you for my life. Tell me,... ..who am l? Captain's log, star date 43960.6. Our mission to map the Zeta Gelis Star Cluster is proceeding on time. Dr Crusher reports that the recovery of the patient she calls John Doe continues at a remarkable pace. Are you experiencing any discomfort? None. I can feel the life returning to my body. Your neurofibre waves are functioning almost normally again. That puts you about six weeks ahead of my original schedule. That'll give you something to talk about. You are all we've talked about since your arrival. I'm ready for the next phase of my treatment. You are right. You're taking up valuable bed space. These motor-assist bands will provide you with electrical stimulation for your arms and legs. They'll help you relearn how to control your muscles. You've been off your feet for almost a month. Don't be disappointed if at first your mobility's restricted. Your limbs are still weak. I appreciate your concern, Doctor, but I think I may surprise you again. I feel strong enough to fly. Whoops! I should concentrate on walking first. Let's try it again, but a little more slowly this time. Much more slowly. I envy your reflexes, Captain. I envy your strength of will. Dr Crusher has kept me informed of your progress. It's extraordinary. I have an extraordinary doctor. She gave me back my life. I hope that I am worthy of her efforts. Are you still unable to recall anything about your past? Unfortunately, my memories begin the moment I woke up in sickbay. Dr Crusher said you think I was in a battle. I'm quite sure of that. Have you any idea how you came to be in that escape pod or what happened to the ship? No. Believe me, it's horrible not knowing who you are or where you're from. Have you tried synaptic induction? His neural nets don't fit known patterns. Conventional neurotherapy has proven ineffective. Hopefully, his memory pathways will re-establish themselves naturally. That same pain? Yes. I think I've made enough progress for one day. Not a relapse, I hope. It's nothing to do with his previous wounds. It's to do with the mutation of his cell structure. You have no theory as to the cause? It makes no sense. I seem to be a mystery, Doctor. To you and to myself. Well, this is where I get off. See you tonight in ten-forward? Yeah, I'll be there. Hello, Commander. Miss Henshaw. Bridge. Deck six. You and Miss Henshaw are seeing a lot of each other. Every night this week. Is that all? You've had that smile on your face a lot longer than that. I guess I have. This last month, everything seems to be going my way. Something has changed around here. What's changed is you. Me? I'm the same guy I always was. If you say so. I don't remember the old Geordi having much success with Miss Henshaw. Well, maybe I am more confident than I used to be. What happened to you? I was kayaking in the holodeck again. You dislocated your shoulder. Sit down. I'll get the osteotractor frame. Hi, Mom. We still on for dinner? 7.30 sharp. I'll be right back. Kayaking again? Yeah. How's my mom's favourite patient? Judge for yourself. Not bad. Your mom promised me a tour of the ship tomorrow. You may find this hard to believe, but sickbay can be very boring. Doc! I'm dying out here. Don't worry, my friend. You'll be alright. The pain's gone. It's completely healed. I don't understand. What did you do? I don't know. It was instinct. I just touched him. I've run every test and scan on him that I can think of. There's no physiological evidence to indicate that he would possess such powers. But then, so much about John is a mystery. You know, I really like him. He does have a certain charm. The entire medical staff has commented on it. You seem taken with him yourself. He has a strength and serenity that I find very attractive. And yet he's vulnerable. I guess I find him intriguing. Seems there's more to it than that. Are you asking whether I'm getting romantically involved? You said it. I didn't. My feelings towards him aren't romantic exactly. I mean, I know the doctor/patient relationship can create a false sense of intimacy, but this is different. There's an almost spiritual connection. I guess I'm not making any sense, am l? I think I understand. Data, I was thinking about the storage capsule last night. I was wondering, what if we've been going about this the wrong way? We've analyzed its mechanical properties. What if it's a biochemical storage medium? Do you think it employs memory RNA like an organic cell? It does contain nucleic acids. The information may be encoded in the molecular patterns. Computer, scan the storage capsule. Analyze molecular sequences on nucleic acid chains. What do you know. A navigational chart. It appears your hypothesis was correct. I knew it. Captain! Found something? The storage capsule from the pod contains navigational information. Can you match these stars to our charts? Computer, run transformational matrix calculations. Match navigational reference to known stars in this sector. Information incomplete. No correlation. I'm not giving up. Not after coming so close. You know, that might be flight-path information from John's ship, but with no frame of reference, I can't determine its origin. Computer, assume those paths are course corrections. Derive gravitational values for stellar objects near flight paths. Most are ordinary G-type stars. This would appear to be a neutron star, possibly a pulsar. Which means this may be a rotational time reference. Computer, assume these symbols are pulsars, translate associated values into standard temporal notations. Computer, is there a pulsar with a rotational period of 1 .5244 seconds within sensor range? Affirmative. Bingo! Computer, overlay navigation chart and project a flight path back. Flight path originated at bearing 003, mark 015. Distance, 2.3 parsecs. That's it. That's where John Doe came from. That bearing is on our planned course. Good. We can continue our mission without significant interruption. Home? Yes. With information from your escape pod, we may be able to return you to your people. I cannot go back. Why's that? You must not take me home, Captain. John, your memory, has it returned? All I know is we came here to escape. Escape? There were others? Yes, I was not alone. But what happened to the others, or what we were escaping from, I cannot remember. But I do know you must not take me back. Not yet! We won't get to your star system for three weeks. That gives us plenty of time to discuss this further. Hopefully, you will have regained more of your memory. You're right, of course, Captain. I apologize for my outburst. It's understandable. This ship is astounding. It seems to stretch on without end. We can see the rest of it some other time. It's your first day out of sickbay and I don't want you overexerted. This looks like an ideal place to rest. My thoughts exactly. Truly remarkable. What is? These people are so different and yet they work together freely. That surprises you? It is new to me. My people are different somehow. If only I could remember. Yesterday, for one terrifying moment, there was clarity. You mean the energy pulse? Yes, for that moment, my purpose seemed clear. And then it was gone. The pain, the energy pulse, must be linked to the cell mutation in the body. I wish I could help you find the truth. Beverly, you've done so much for me. I only wish I could repay you. But you have. The friendship we've developed has made me very happy. The rapport between us also means a great deal to me. But I am on some kind of a journey. Whatever brought me here, whatever is happening to my body, is all part of that journey. And I must complete it... ..before any other consideration. Sir, I am reading a vessel on long-range scanners. It is coming from Sector 9569. What configuration? Impossible to identify at this distance. However, it is on an intercept course. Captain, the ship is travelling at warp 9.72. Warp 9.72? Time till intercept? 1 0 hours, 53 minutes. Try and hail them, Mr. Worf. No response, Captain. Monitor their approach. Repeat the hail every half-hour. Whoever they are, they're in a big hurry to get here. Dr Crusher, medical emergency, room four. I can't make it stop. John, is it worse than before? Much worse. Shall I get something for the pain? No, it wouldn't do any good. His cell structure is transforming. I have to leave, Beverly. John, where do you have to go? I must get off this ship. That's impossible. Not in your condition. I must! Security. OK, let's realign the magnetic inducer on the starboard nacelle. John! Leave the control booth immediately. John, listen to me. You must come down. I'll try to help you. Step away from the controls. Get back. Please, stay away. I have no wish to harm you, but you must return to sickbay immediately. Do not come any closer. I cannot control what is happening to me. His neck is broken. No life signs. Sickbay, form a resuscitation team. Transporter room, stand by. Hold it! No, don't. Hold still. Doc. I can't believe it. There's no trace of injury. You admit you were trying to steal a shuttlecraft? Yes. So I ask you again, why? I don't know. Unacceptable. You had a reason. What was it? You nearly killed Worf. And healed him. That's why he's here and not in the brig. I warned him. I told him it was dangerous. Why? Why was it dangerous? What is happening to you? I don't know. The metamorphosis is accelerating. It's as if your body generates an electrical field that warps the tissue. Who are you? What are you? I'm afraid. For myself. For all of you. I have to get away. Isolate myself. Whatever is happening to me, it's dangerous. As Lt Worf discovered. I don't want to hurt anyone. For the sake of your crew, let me go before this happens again. I don't believe you're capable of harming... Captain, the alien vessel is within weapons range. Its shields are up. I'm on my way. I want him kept under constant surveillance. John. I really want to thank you. For what? I don't know how or even why but down on the planet you gave me something. A new confidence. I doubt I can take credit for that. Perhaps I only helped you find something you already had. Captain, on screen. Alien vessel approaching at half-impulse, sir. Heading 051, mark 114. Raise shields. Slow to one-third impulse power. Bring us to 1 03, mark 025. Mr. Worf, hail the alien vessel. They continue to ignore our hail, sir. They are scanning us, sir. They are answering our hail. On screen. Sunad! You know him? Yes. I don't know how, but he's dangerous. I am Cmdr Sunad of Zalkon. You are trespassing into our space. You are holding a Zalkonian citizen. I am Capt Picard of the United Federation. We do not intend... Return him to us immediately. This individual is a guest aboard our ship. We found him dying in a shipwreck. We returned him to health. Then you aided a criminal. He is one of four escaped prisoners. We eliminated the other three. We thought this one dead. Return him so we may complete our task. Of what is he accused? He is a disruptive influence. He spreads lies. He encourages dissent. He disturbs the natural order of our society. In what way? It is not your concern. I will give you two hours to comply. Tactical analysis. The Zalkonian ship is formidable. Their weaponry is comparable to ours. They are as fast and manoeuvrable as us. Counsellor, will they do it? I believe so. Sunad's hatred for John was evident, but there is something else. The Zalkonians are afraid of John. Cmdr Riker, Counsellor, Doctor, John, join us. Data, you have the bridge. Mr. Worf, counter any Zalkonian moves. Aye, sir. I can neither confirm nor deny what the Zalkonians told you. They make serious accusations against you. They may be true. I don't know. I don't believe that I am a criminal. You understand the difficult position in which I am placed? Completely. And I refuse to place your ship in danger. If necessary, I will surrender to them. But I am convinced there is more at stake here than my life. There's something important I must complete. My survival is vital. If I could explain it, I would. I'll inform you of my decision shortly. You're not considering...? We must consider all options, and not let our feelings impede our judgement. It's irrelevant that he'll die? Our approval of the Zalkonians' intentions is not the issue. But for what it's worth, I believe that John is correct that his existence has broader ramifications than that of a criminal. Sunad thinks so. He's personally threatened by John. Sunad called John a disruptive influence. Hardly a capital offence. It's not up to us to judge their laws. I know how I would feel if the situation were reversed, if they held a Federation citizen. The Zalkonians don't understand our indecision about returning John. They think we shouldn't be involved. But we are involved! I saved his life. For what? So they can chase him down and take away that life again? We will not tolerate more delays. Commander, let me remind you, we are on a mission of exploration. We want to establish peaceful relations with those we encounter. We do not want relations with you. If that is your wish, we will respect it. We want you to leave our space after you return the criminal. We will leave. It is not our policy to intervene in other cultures. But before I return the survivor to you, I would appreciate an explanation of what he has done to merit a death sentence. It is not your concern! Agreed. But there are circumstances of which you may be unaware. The survivor has suffered a memory loss. He is ill-equipped to defend himself. There is no defence! Our judgement is final. One more thing. Since recovery, he's manifested unusual abilities. What kind of abilities? He has the power to heal injuries with a simple touch. Lies. And even to reverse death itself. Obviously he has corrupted you as well. I see I'm wasting my time. I can't breathe. It's come back to me, Beverly. I know who I am. What I am. Ready all weapons. You will no longer harm these people. Fire upon that ship. Do not be afraid. I won't hurt you. Kill him, Captain. He's evil. You could learn from these people, Sunad. They do not fear me. They don't know how dangerous you are. You and your kind. Leaders like you have maintained that for generations. It is not true. Captain, my species is on the verge of a wondrous evolutionary change. A transmutation beyond our physical being. I am the first of my kind to approach this metamorphosis. They said it was a sickness we would never survive. That the pain and energy pulses would kill us. They said we were dangerous. They killed anyone undergoing the transfiguration. We were protecting our society. By murdering us. You saw us as a threat. You were terrified of what you didn't understand. Some suspected that what was happening to them was not evil. Four of us decided to flee Zalkon and let the metamorphosis take its course. You hunted us down, killed the others, but I survived... ..with the help of a kind... ..and generous people. There is nothing to fear. You can join me. All Zalkonians can. Let me show you. Don't touch me! As you wish. But others will listen now that I can tell the truth. Those who are willing will follow me. Sunad is back aboard the Zalkonian vessel, Captain. My people are embarking on a new realm, a new plane of existence, thanks to you. It is our mission to seek out life in all forms. We're privileged to be present at the emergence of a new species. Beverly, you gave me life and more. I do not have the words for my gratitude,... ..or my sorrow at leaving you. "
S3E26,"Captain's log, star date 43989. 1. We have arrived at Jouret IV in response to a distress signal from one of the Federation's outermost colonies. Anything from the surface? No, sir. No communications from the colony for over 1 2 hours. Sensors picking up signs of life? None. The surface environment is safe for transport, Commander. Mr. O'Brien. Verify the coordinates for the New Providence colony. Coordinates verified. You're at the centre of town. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, star date 43992.6. Admiral Hanson and Lt Cmdr Shelby of Starfleet Tactical will review the disappearance of New Providence colony. No sign remains of the 900 inhabitants. The truth is... Hell, we are not ready. We've long known they were coming. We threw all our resources into this, but... You're convinced it is the Borg? That's what I'm here to find out. Surface conditions are identical to your report from System J-25. Cmdr Riker wrote those reports. He agrees with you. Cmdr Shelby took over Borg tactical analysis six months ago. I give her a wide latitude when I want to get things done. That's how I intend to operate here. My priority has been to develop some kind, any kind, of defence strategy. Nothing we have now can stop them. We're designing new weapons, but they're all on the drawing board. We expected much more lead time. Your encounter with the Borg was over 7,000 light years away. If this is the Borg, they have a power source far superior to our own. I'd like to see the colony site. It'll be dark there soon. A team is scheduled for dawn. Number One, why don't you show the Commander to her quarters? It's poker night, Admiral. There's always an open seat for you. Another time. Your captain and I have a lot to cover. But rumour has it Cmdr Shelby has played a hand or two! Keep your eye on her, Jean-Luc. She's one very impressive young lady. You seem taken with her, JP. Just an old man's fantasies. When she came to Tactical, every admiral's uncle had a take on this Borg business. She cut through it. She put us on track. Earl Grey? Please. She'd be one hell of a first officer. I already have one of those. Don't tell me he's going to pass up another commission! One's available? The Melbourne. It's his if he wants it. Hasn't he told you? He'll make a fine captain, JP. You may want to tell him that. We're still waiting on his decision. This is the third time we've pulled out the captain's chair for Riker. He just won't sit down. Let me tell you something, Jean-Luc. There are a lot of young hotshots like Shelby on the way up. Riker could suddenly look like he's standing still next to them. He's hurting his career by staying put. If I were you, I'd kick him in the rear end for his own good. I don't know exactly what I'm looking for, but we've tested the sections of the hull damaged by the Borg. There were some unusual magnetic resonance traces. A Borg footprint? That's my theory. I'll see if it holds up tomorrow. I'm assigning Mr. La Forge and Mr. Data to accompany me on the away team. I've already assigned them to the away team. And I'll be with you as well. Of course. I appreciate any assistance you can offer. Is serving aboard the Enterprise as amazing as I've heard? Every bit. Good. I intend to convince Capt Picard that I'm right for the job. Job? Which job? Yours, of course. I'm sorry. I heard that you were leaving. If I were, I'm sure you'd be the first to know. Poker's at 1 700 hours in my quarters. Deck eight. Got another king in the hole, Data? I cannot answer that, Wesley. And as you are a newcomer, it is inappropriate for you to ask. I will buy another card. No help there. Fold again! Three jacks for the handsome young ensign. Pair of deuces stands. Flush. Possible straight flush. Your bet, Mr. Crusher. I'm in for ten. Call. Now it's time for the long pants. There's your ten... One hundred. He's got the straight flush. Not necessarily. Cmdr Riker may be bluffing, Wesley. I don't think so. Fold. With three jacks? Are you kidding? You may get ""As in school, but you don't know about poker. Well, I've only got two pairs, but I've got to see your hole card. I'll call. You got him! Mr. Data and our guest appear to be tardy. Sir, they beamed down to the planet's surface an hour ago. On whose authority? On hers, sir. Morning. Early bird gets the worm, eh? We've had some interesting results. Cmdr Shelby. Walk with me, Commander. Early bird? I believe Cmdr Shelby erred. There are no avifaunal or vermicular life forms on Jouret IV. That's not what she meant, Data. But you're right. She erred. Sorry, but I woke up early and saw a weather system moving in. It may have affected soil readings. So with no regard for the risk... If we ran into the Borg, two extra bodies would make no difference. We had three hours before the storm hit. Less than two hours now. Data was available. I took him. We came. I don't see your problem. I expect to be notified before there's a change in my orders. Noted for future reference. Do you wish to hear my report, sir? Go ahead. The soil contains the same magnetic traces. That's our footprint. There's no doubt any more. It is the Borg. Captain's log, star date 43993.5. With confirmation of the Borg's presence, Admiral Hanson has returned to discuss strategy with Command. Lt Cmdr Shelby remains on board to continue tactical preparations. I've ordered a standing yellow alert. Federation outposts have been warned. Ops will monitor long-range sensors. Data, La Forge and Mr. Crusher will work with Cmdr Shelby. Good. You've covered all the bases. What's your impression of Shelby? She knows her stuff. She has your full confidence? I think she needs supervision. She takes the initiative too easily, sometimes with risks. Sounds like a young lieutenant commander I recruited! Perhaps. Will. What the hell are you still doing here? Sir? You've been offered the Melbourne. I've decided not to pursue that. She's a fine ship, Will. Yes, but she's not the Enterprise. With all due respect, sir, you need me. Particularly now. Indeed? Starfleet needs good captains, particularly now. Reconsider your decision. Are you telling me to leave? I'm asking you to look at your career objectively. Will. You're ready to work without a net. You're ready to take command. And you know, the Enterprise will go along just fine without you. What am I still doing here? Deanna, I pushed myself hard to get this far. I sacrificed a lot. I said I wanted my own command, yet something's holding me back. Is it wrong for me to want to stay? What do you think? Maybe I'm afraid of the big chair. I don't think so. The Captain says Shelby reminds him of the way I used to be. He's right. She comes here full of drive and ambition. Impatient, taking risks. What happened to those things in me? I liked those things about me. I've lost something. You mean you're older, more experienced. A little more seasoned. Seasoned? That's a horrible thing to say to a man. I don't think you've lost a thing. And I think you've gained more than you realize. You're more comfortable with yourself than you used to be. Maybe that's the problem. I'm too comfortable here. I'm not sure I know what that means. You're happy here, happier than I've ever known you to be. So it comes down to a simple question. What do you want, Will Riker? A manipulation effect in the Borg ship's field. A pattern at 4.8-minute intervals during your first confrontation. Might be high-output auxiliary generators. Their systems may be decentralized, with redundant power sources throughout the ship. A reasonable conclusion. Borg technology enables all of them to interface and function collectively. It is likely they constructed their ship that way. Knock out one generator and another one takes over. What damage would we have to do to shut them down? A Borg ship like this could probably continue to function even if 78 percent of it was inoperable. And our best shot barely scratched the surface. From what I've seen, none of these new weapons can be ready in less than 1 8 months. We've been projecting 24. Is there anything we could do here to adapt our current defence systems? We'll have to go through the specs again, but... I don't know. My mind's turned to clay. Mine, too. Let's modify the plasma phaser design. Let's call it a night. That's an order. Reconvene at 0500. Sir, may I continue with Mr. Data who does not require rest? You need rest, Commander. If we have a confrontation with the Borg... If we have a confrontation, I don't want a crew fighting the Borg and their own fatigue. Dismissed. At 1900 hours yesterday the USS Lalo departed Zeta Alpha II on a freight run to Sentinel Minor IV. At 2200 hours and 12 minutes, a distress signal was received at Star base 157. The Lalo reported contact with an alien vessel, described as cube-shaped. The distress signal ended abruptly and she's not been heard from since. How long would it take to get there at warp nine? One hour, 1 7 minutes. Make it so. We're coming with every available starship to assist, Captain, but the closest help is six days away. We'll try and keep them occupied until you arrive. I know you will. Hanson out. All hands stand to. Battle stations. What is the status of our defences? Mr. La Forge will change shield nutation. That should hold them off. And we're retuning phaser frequencies to disrupt their subspace field. What's your assessment of our potential effectiveness? It's a shot in the dark. But for now it's the best we can do. Dismissed. Sir, reading unidentified vessel just entering sensor range. Bearing 21 0, mark 1 51 . Hail them, Mr. Worf. No response, sir. Move to intercept. Aye, sir. Sir, the vessel has already changed course to intercept us. Approaching at warp 9.3. Entering visual range. On screen. Magnify. Mr. Worf, dispatch a subspace message to Admiral Hanson. We have engaged the Borg. Captain, you are being hailed. I am? Yes, Captain. By name. Data, is it the same ship we faced at J-25? Uncertain. But the dimensions are precisely the same. On screen. I'm Captain... Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise, NCC-1701-D. Lower your shields. Prepare to transport yourself to our vessel. If you do not cooperate, we will destroy your ship. You committed acts of aggression against the Federation. If you do not withdraw... Surrender yourself or we will destroy your ship. Your defences cannot withstand... What do they want with you? I thought they weren't interested in humans, only our technology. Their priorities have changed. Open. Channel open. We have developed new defences since our last meeting. And we will use them if you do not withdraw from Federation space! Captain, the shields are being probed. I'm modulating nutation. They are attempting to lock on to us with a tractor beam. Load torpedo bays. Arm phasers. Lock on to the source of the beam. Shield status? Holding, sir. The nutation confused them. They have the ability to analyze and adapt. Shield modulation has failed. They've locked on. Shields are being drained. 90 percent. 80... Trying to recalibrate nutation. Damn! Shields have failed. Fire all weapons. Their subspace field is intact. New frequencies had no impact. Reverse engines. Full reverse. We're not moving. Fire at will. Launching torpedoes. Phaser spread continuing. Still no damage to the Borg vessel. Warning, outer hull breach. They are cutting into Engineering. Geordi, evacuate Engineering. Computer, evacuation sequence! Sealing doors to core. Move it, people. Let's go. Decompression danger, deck 36, section four. Sealing main Engineering. Data, fluctuate phaser resonance frequencies. Random settings. Don't give them time to adapt. Tractor beam released. Warp nine. Course, 1 51 , mark 330. Engage. They're in pursuit, Captain. Maintain course. Damage report, Geordi? Hull rupture. The damage is pretty heavy. We lost a lot of good people. Eleven dead, eight unaccounted for. Repair teams, seal hull breach. I can control functions from here. Approaching the Paulson Nebula. Drop to impulse. Take us in, Ensign. The field's getting too dense, sir. Steady. Analysis of the nebula cloud? 82 percent dilithium hydroxides. Magnesium, chromium. It should be a screen against their sensors. Mr. La Forge, prepare to reverse engines. Full stop. The Borg ship is continuing scans, attempting to locate us. Good. As long as they're looking for us, they won't hurt anyone else. Time index 51 4. Data fluctuates phaser resonance frequencies. The Borg's beam breaks contact. Slow playback. Take a closer look. Mr. La Forge? There's a brief two-percent drop in power, but it is system-wide. Phaser frequency spread was high and narrow. Borg power nodes may be vulnerable to those frequencies. If we can generate a burst of power at that same frequency distribution, more than our phasers or torpedoes could provide. How do we do that? The main deflector dish. It's the only component designed to channel that much power. End program. Unfortunately, there is one slight detail. In the process, the blast destroys the Enterprise as well. If we got further away, increased the deflector's range... It could work. Meanwhile, we should retune phasers to the same frequency. Proceed. I'll inform the Captain. I have one other recommendation. Separate the saucer. A skeleton crew can create a diversion. We may need power from its engines. It'd give them more to worry about. It's too great a risk. I'd like the Captain to decide. I bring all the alternatives to his attention. That'll be all. I need to install stronger power transfers to the dish. How long? Better part of a day. She gets a full head of steam. She's a formidable presence. But I'm convinced she can help us. I am, too. Don't worry about it. I can handle Shelby. Come. Come in, Number One. Cmdr Shelby was just telling me of your concerns about her plan. I have already informed her... I agree with you, Number One. It's not the time. But the time may come when we will have to take greater risks. Consider her plan as a fall-back position. Make the preparations. Very good, sir. Deck eight, battle bridge. Halt. You and I need to have a conversation. You never ordered me not to discuss it. You disagree with me, fine. You need to take it to the Captain, fine. Through me. You do an end-run around me again, I'll snap you back so hard, you'll think you're a first-year cadet. May I be speak frankly, sir? By all means. You're in my way. Really? How terrible for you. All you know how to do is play it safe. That's why you've sat in the shadow of a great man for so long, passing up one command after another. Proceed to deck eight! When it comes to this ship and this crew, you're damned right I play it safe. If you can't make the big decisions, Commander, then make room for someone who can. Captain's log, star date 43996.2. We remain concealed in the dust cloud. To my surprise, the Borg have held position, waiting for us to come out. I have no explanation for their special interest in me or this ship. We continue to prepare for the inevitable confrontation, but I must admit on this night I contemplate the possibility that no defence may be adequate against this enemy. Trouble sleeping? It's something of a tradition, Guinan. The Captain touring the ship before a battle. Before a hopeless battle, if I remember the tradition correctly. Not necessarily. Nelson toured the HMS Victory before Trafalgar. Yes, but Nelson never returned from Trafalgar, did he? No, but the battle was won. Do you expect this battle to be won? We may yet prevail. That's a conceit, but it's a healthy one. I wonder if the Emperor Honorius, watching the Visigoths coming over the hill, truly realized that the Roman Empire was about to fall. This is just another page in history, isn't it? Will this be the end of our civilization? Turn the page. This isn't the end. You say that with remarkable assuredness. With experience. When the Borg destroyed my world, my people were scattered throughout the universe. We survived. As will humanity survive. As long as there's a handful of you to keep the spirit alive, you will prevail. Even if it takes a millennium. Capt Picard, report to the bridge. I'm on my way, Lieutenant. They're some sort of magnetometric-guided charges. Status of shields? Back to 48 percent, Captain. We may have to leave the nebula. I want all the power you have. Recommend we adjust shield harmonics to the upper EM band when proceeding. Acknowledged. Direct hit, deck nine. Damage report? Latching-system integrity breached. Prepare to take us out of here. Fire up. Half-impulse till we clear the nebula, then warp nine. Ready phasers. Load forward torpedo bays. Engage! Tractor beam trying to lock on. Fire at will. Continue rotating shield frequency. Shields failing. Tractor beam has locked on. It's no use. They've adapted to the new frequencies. The Borg ship disengaging. Leaving at warp speed. Maintain pursuit. Borg vessel has reached warp nine. 9.4, 9.6. Stay with them. O'Brien, can you get a fix on the Captain? Negative, sir. There's interference. I can't lock in on a signal. Senior officers, report to the bridge. The coordinates they have set, they're on a course to Sector 001 . The Terran System. Earth. Capt Jean-Luc Picard, you lead the strongest ship in the Federation. You speak for your people. I have nothing to say. I will resist you with my last ounce of strength! Strength is irrelevant. Resistance is futile. We wish to improve ourselves, to have your biological and technological distinctiveness. Your culture will adapt to service ours. Impossible! My culture is based on freedom and self-determination. Freedom is irrelevant. So is self-determination. You must comply. We would rather die. Death is irrelevant. Your archaic cultures are authority-driven. To facilitate our introduction into your societies, we have decided a human voice will speak for us in all communications. You have been chosen to be that voice. They are leading us into the heart of our own defences. So far they haven't had much reason to worry about those! If the Borg stay at warp 9.6, we'll have to discontinue pursuit in less than three hours. Two hours, 40 minutes. When will the deflector be ready? We're close. A few hours maybe. I know, I'll get it done in two. But I need serious power from the engines to make this weapon work. We're using all we've got just to keep up. Sir, we've got to get that ship down to impulse. I'm leading an away team to get the Captain back. We'll get them out of warp. Crusher, continue to help Mr. La Forge. Cmdr Shelby, you'll take the bridge. Data, Worf, Doctor, you're with me. With my knowledge of the Borg... Those are my orders! Cmdr Riker. It is inappropriate for you to lead the away team. Until the Captain's return, you are in command of the Enterprise. We're in a state of war and your place is on the bridge. Cmdr Shelby, you'll lead the away team. Make it so. First Officer's log, star date 43998.5. Our pursuit of the Borg is taking us to the core of the Federation. The devastation they could bring is unimaginable. These have been retuned. Each has a different frequency on the upper EM band. We can only use each of these once, maybe twice, before the Borg adapt. Don't fire until you have to. What resistance should we expect? At our first encounter, the Borg ignored us when we beamed aboard. Clearly they did not consider us a threat. That may change, however, if we start interfering with their plans. Shelby to bridge. Away team ready. We have 58 minutes before we have to disengage. Understood. Proceed. No unnecessary risks. Clear? Very clear, sir. Shelby out. Velocity matched for transport. Energize. Tricorder functions minimal. Any signs of human life? Inconclusive. Look at this! This is extraordinary. These appear to be some kind of power-wave-guide conduits which allow them to work collectively as they perform ship functions. We can't take out enough of these to disable them. What if we look at this from a mosquito's point of view? Interesting metaphor, Doctor. What is your idea? If we sting them in a tender spot, they might stop to scratch. Distribution nodes. If we take out a few of these, it might make them scratch. The Captain's communicator. It is still activated. Crusher to Picard. Can you hear me? Can you locate it, Worf? This way! I strongly recommend redeploying all defences to protect Sector 001 . We're moving to intercept at Wolf 359. We'll make our stand there. How much longer can you maintain pursuit? 22 minutes at their current speed. If we can't bring them out of warp, we'll do as much damage as we can before we have to disengage. Picard? Nothing yet, sir. In here. Shelby to Enterprise. Go ahead. We've found the Captain's uniform and communicator. Resuming search. Stand by, Commander. We're in business. It'll burn out the deflector, but it'll be a hell of a bang! Radiation danger? We have to evacuate half the secondary hull and the lower decks of the saucer. I'll see to that. Cmdr Shelby, we have only 17 minutes of warp power left. Try to get them out of warp. Acknowledged. Shelby out. Let's take out some distribution nodes and see what happens. Sir, they've done it. The Borg ship is dropping out of warp. Go to impulse. Aye, sir. Diverting warp power to deflector. Move us to within 40,000 kilometres. Match velocity. Commence arming sequence. Increase deflector modulation to upper frequency band. Shelby to Enterprise. Encountering resistance. Prepare to beam us back. They're adapting! Jean-Luc! Captain! Enterprise, get us out of here! The Captain? We were unable to retrieve him. He has been altered by the Borg. Altered? He is a Borg! We'll go back. I need more people. We'll retune the phasers. We'll get him out. Reading subspace field fluctuations from within the Borg ship. Looks like they're restoring power. They'll be capable of warp any minute. Is the deflector ready? It's ready. Will, he's alive. If we get him back here maybe I can restore... This is our only chance to destroy them before our weapon is useless. We'll sabotage them again. We can't maintain power. We don't have time. Prepare to fire. Consult with Starfleet Command. Get Admiral Hanson. Belay that order. There's no time! Sir, we are being hailed by the Borg. On screen. I am Locutus of Borg. Resistance is futile. Your life as it has been is over. From this time forward, you will service us. Mr. Worf. Fire. "
S4E01," Mr. Worf, dispatch a subspace message to Admiral Hanson. We have engaged the Borg. Fluctuate phaser resonance frequencies. Random settings. Don't give them time to adapt. We're coming with every available starship to assist, Captain, but the closest help is six days away. All you know how to do is play it safe. If you can't make the big decisions, then make room for someone who can. Generate a burst of power at that same frequency distribution. How? The main deflector dish. We've found the Captain's uniform and communicator. Jean-Luc! We were unable to retrieve him. The Captain was altered by the Borg. Will, he's alive. If we get him back here maybe I can restore... This is our only chance to destroy them before our weapon is useless. I am Locutus... of Borg. From this time forward, you will service... us. Mr. Worf? Fire.  Deflector power at maximum. Energy discharge in six seconds. Firing, sir. The Borg ship is undamaged. Impossible. Warning. Warp reactor core primary coolant failure. We can't maintain it. Warning. Exceeding reaction chamber thermal limit. Cease fire. Shutting down warp engines. They couldn't have adapted that quickly. The knowledge and experience of the human Picard is part of us now. It has prepared us for all possible courses of action. Your resistance is hopeless, Number One. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. First Officer's log, star date 44001.4. The Borg ship has resumed its course toward Earth. We are unable to pursue, pending repairs. The blast burned out our main navigational deflector. We have damage to our shields and reactor core. We'll be back up in eight to 12 hours, Admiral. Well, we'll miss you at the party. The Enterprise will be there. Maybe late, but we'll be there. Your engagements have given us valuable time. We've mobilized a fleet of 40 starships at Wolf 359. That's for starters. The Klingons are sending warships. We may even talk with the Romulans. With the assistance of Capt Picard, the Borg will be ready for you. A few years ago, I watched a freshman cadet pass four upperclassmen on the last hill of the 40 km run on Danula II. Damnedest thing I ever saw. The only freshman to ever win the Academy marathon. I made it my business to get to know him. I got to know him well. I'll tell you something. I never met anyone with more drive, determination or more courage than Jean-Luc Picard. There is no way in hell that he would assist the Borg. I want that clear. Of course, Admiral. He is... a casualty of war. Then we have abandoned all hope of recovering him. In less than 24 hours, this armada will hit that Borg vessel with everything we can muster. Either they survive or we do. As for Picard... A great man has been lost. Your captain. My friend. Cmdr Riker, I hereby promote you to the field commission of captain. The Enterprise is your ship now. Congratulations. I wish the circumstances were different. Likewise. Good luck, Admiral. To us all. Mr. Crusher suggests designing a chip to retune the phasers to a random setting after each discharge. That would be an advantage. We should try to neutralize their force fields. We must let them know that we can adapt, too. We're not just fighting the Borg, but the life experience they stole from Picard. How do we defeat an enemy that knows us so well? They have no honour or courage. That is our greatest advantage. I hope it's enough. Accelerator coils are normal. Excellent. Forward shields at 58 percent. Aft shields... Sensors must be down. Checking. Sensors are fine. No. Aft shields have failed. Damn it! Auxiliary generators are out. Just the man I need. We're having problems with the aft-shield generators. I need your help, Worf. When do we get under way? A couple of hours. Cmdr Shelby can fill you in. The main deflector is functional again. We're in final testing now. The warp reactor core? Reconstruction is proceeding normally. It's slow work. If we can nail down the shield-generator problem, we should be operating in two to three hours. Good. Anything else, sir? Yes. You did a good job on the Borg ship. I didn't get Picard. You stopped them. You gave us our shot. Sir, I... We don't have to like each other to work well together. I'd like you to continue to keep me on my toes. Some might define that as the role of a first officer. Damn, you are ambitious, Shelby. Based on our past relationship, there's no reason for me to expect to be your first officer except that you need me. I have the expertise in the Borg. And you have a lot to learn. Yes, sir. Almost as much as I had to learn when I became Picard's first officer. A fact he reminded me of when I told him what a pain you are. Yes, sir. Data to Riker. Message from Starfleet. Go ahead. Starfleet reports it has engaged the Borg at Wolf 359, sir. Admiral Hanson on subspace, Captain. On screen. Admiral? The fight does not go well, Enterprise. We're attempting to withdraw and regroup. Rendezvous at... Captain's log, star date 44002.3. Repairs are complete. The Enterprise will rendezvous with Starfleet at Wolf 359. Communications have been cut, possibly due to Borg interference. Lt Worf, everyone shares my respect for your service to this ship. But right now I need your experience at tactical. Cmdr Data, I realize your very nature omits ambition. But I want you to know I considered you as first officer. Thank you, sir. But this is not the time for change. I need all of you where you are. Where Capt Picard relied on you. I have been, reluctantly, forced to conclude that Cmdr Shelby, our expert on the Borg, is an ideal choice for first officer. We can assume that the Borg survived the fleet's attack. Your thoughts on our next move? What about the heavy graviton beam we talked about? It's not strong enough to incapacitate them. Dr Crusher and I worked on an interesting premise. With our experience in nanotechnology, we could introduce destructive nanites into the Borg. Nanites? Robots. Small enough to enter living cells. How long would that take? Two to three weeks. By then, nanites may be all that's left of the Federation. We have the new phaser adapters. With the photon torpedoes, they might work. I'm sure Capt Picard would have something inspirational to say now. I wish he was here cos I'd like to hear it, too. I know how difficult this transition has been for all of you. I can take over, but I could never replace Capt Picard. Nor would I try. Whatever the outcome, I'm sure our efforts in the coming battle will justify his faith in all of us. Dismissed. What would you do? Come. May I speak to you? Actually... Picard and I used to talk now and then when one of us needed to. I guess I'm just used to having the Captain's ear. What's on your mind? I've heard a lot of people talking in ten-forward. They expect to be dead soon. They trust you. They like you. But they don't believe anyone can save them. I'm not sure anyone can. When a man is convinced he's going to die tomorrow, he'll probably make it happen. The only one who can turn this around is you. I'll do the best I can. You'll have to do something you don't want to do. You have to let go of Picard. Maybe you haven't heard. I tried to kill him yesterday! You tried to kill whatever that is on the Borg ship. Not Picard. Picard is still here with us in this room. If he had died, it would be easier. But he didn't. They took him from us a piece at a time. Did he ever tell you why we're so close? No. Then let me just say that our relationship is beyond friendship, beyond family. And I will let him go. And you must do the same. There can only be one captain. It's not that simple. He wrote the book on this ship. If the Borg know what he knows, it's time to throw that book away. You must let him go, Riker. It's the only way to beat him. The only way to save him. And that is now your chair, Captain. We are approaching the Wolf System, Captain. On my way. Slow to impulse. Take us to the battle coordinates, Mr. Crusher. Yellow alert. Sensors are picking up several vessels. The fleet? No active subspace fields. Negligible power readings. Life signs? Negative, sir. Visual contact. On screen. The Tolstoy. The Kyushu. The Melbourne. Sir, sensors are picking up strong eddy currents, bearing 200, mark 211. Data, analysis? It could indicate the course of the Borg ship. Set a course to follow those currents. Separate the saucer section when we find the Borg. Sir, Capt Picard was briefed on that plan. The Borg will be prepared. I'm aware of that, Commander. In fact, I'm counting on it. Crusher, Cartaino, Gleason to the battle bridge. Mr. Data, Mr. Worf? I have a special mission for you. Locutus of Borg, this is Capt William T Riker of the USS Enterprise. You may speak. We wish to end the hostilities. Then you must unconditionally surrender. We are prepared to meet to discuss your terms. It is unlikely you are prepared to discuss terms. It is more likely that this is an attempt at deception. Come now, Locutus. If Picard's knowledge and experience is part of you, then you know I've never lied to him. You should also implicitly trust me, is that not so? Picard implicitly trusted you. Then trust me now. Meet to discuss your terms. Discussion is irrelevant. There are no terms. You will disarm all your weapons and escort us to Sector 001, where we will assimilate your culture and technology... Can you pinpoint the source of the transmission? I can put you within 30 metres. O'Brien, report. The Borg adapted their electromagnetic field to prevent transporter functions. As expected. Mr. Data, Mr. Worf, proceed as we discussed. Aye, Captain. Channel open, sir. We need time to prepare our people for assimilation. Preparation is irrelevant. Your people will be assimilated as easily as Picard has been. Your attempt at a delay will not be successful, Number One. We will proceed to Earth, and if you attempt to intervene, we will destroy you. Then take your best shot, Locutus, cos we are about to intervene. Channel closed. Reset communications. Scrambler code, Riker One. Riker One. Acknowledged. Shelby, report. Ready for separation. Make it so. Order subsequence initiated. Docking latches clear. Separation complete. Saucer velocity 100 metres per second and increasing. Open fire, all weapons. Fire. Borg attempting to lock on, sir. Evasive manoeuvres. Pattern, Riker Alpha. Riker Alpha confirmed. They're ignoring the saucer section. Just as you should, Captain. Ensign, evasive pattern, Riker Beta. Riker Beta confirmed. Second phase, Cmdr Shelby. Fire antimatter spread. Shuttle launch sequence confirmed. Departing Enterprise in exactly three seconds. The Borg tractor beam has moved to the antimatter. They might be picking up engine ionisation. Data, cut your engines. Go in unpowered. We have penetrated the electromagnetic field. Understood. The shuttle escape transporter should be able to beam us onto the Borg ship. Proceed. Data! Mission accomplished. We have him. Firing shuttle thrusters. They're clear of the Borg field. Beam them out, Mr. O'Brien. Locked in. Transport successful, sir. There's damage to the impulse drive. The saucer is disabled. Subspace field fluctuations from the Borg ship. They're increasing power. Stand by, Mr. La Forge. Aye, sir. The saucer section's a sitting duck. Prepare to draw their fire. Captain, the Borg ship is moving away. It's resuming its course to Earth. Rendezvous with the saucer section. Lay in a course of pursuit. The microcircuit fibres infiltrate the tissue. His DNA is being rewritten. Can you revive him? I'd like more time to study the structural changes. We don't have more time. Once he was wired into the Borg, they knew everything he knew. I just hope it goes both ways. Maybe he had access to everything we need to know about them, especially their vulnerabilities. Jean-Luc? It's Beverly. Can you hear me? Beverly... Crusher. Doctor. Yes. Don't try to move. I am on board the Enterprise. That's right. A futile manoeuvre. Incorrect strategy, Number One. To risk your crew and ship to retrieve only one man. Picard would never have approved. You underestimate us if you believe this abduction is any concern. There is no need for apprehension. I intend no harm. No harm. I will continue, aboard this ship, to speak for the Borg, while they continue without further diversion to Sector 001, where they will force your unconditional surrender. Using multimodal reflection sorting, I have detected signals between Locutus and the Borg ship. That's how they control him? It is not just a matter of control. The signals are interactive across a subspace domain similar to a transporter beam. They may form the basis of the Borg's collective consciousness. Can we block them? Possibly. But we have witnessed the Borg removing key circuits from injured comrades, separating them from the group consciousness. The injured Borg self-destruct. That is correct. Cutting the link to Locutus might be fatal to the Captain. We have to find a way to reach him. We must know what he knows. Without these signals, he would just need microsurgery. I could do it. But while these Borg implants are functioning, I can't separate the man from the machine. Then perhaps there is a way I can access the machine, Doctor. Worf. Klingon species. A warrior race. You too will be assimilated. The Klingon Empire will never yield. Why do you resist? We only wish to raise quality of life for all species. I like my species the way it is. A narrow vision. You will become one with the Borg. You will all become one with the Borg. The android, Data. Primitive artificial organism. You will be obsolete in the new order. Take him to your lab, Data. Shelby to Riker. Go ahead. The Borg have entered Sector 001. The Borg have dropped out of warp. Jupiter Outpost 92 had visual contact at 1213. Planetary defences? Responding. But against the Borg... Ensign Crusher, when will they reach Earth? 27 minutes. The soonest we could intercept? 42 minutes, sir. Riker to Data. What's your status? The cybernetic connection into Picard's neural-net pathway has been established. Mr. O'Brien will process the signal through the transport buffer. Make it so. With dispatch. Proceeding immediately, sir. Data, out. The neural link will be established in three stages. Doctor, I suggest you observe Capt Picard's life signs, while Chief O'Brien monitors my positronic-matrix activity. Counsellor, hopefully, you will determine whether I am reaching Capt Picard. At what point should I shut it down if there's a problem? I do not know. I have never done this before. Initiating first neural link. The Captain's vital signs are stable. Positronic activity unchanged. First neural connection is confirmed. I cannot report any significant access to the Borg consciousness. It is confirmed. The Borg have broken through the Mars defense perimeter. Enterprise approaching Terran System. Slow to impulse. Time to intercept? 23 minutes, 14 seconds, sir. Second neural connection is confirmed. I still cannot report any significant access. Proceeding with the final link. Increase in premotor area and hypothalamus activity. His heartbeat is accelerating. Submicron-matrix activity increasing exponentially. Neural connections complete. I have access to the Borg subspace signals. Processing. Processing. Data! Stand by. Processing. Processing. Fascinating. The Borg group-consciousness is divided into subcommands necessary to carry out all functions. Defense, communication, navigation. They are all controlled by a root command implanted into each... I'm picking up increased neural activity localized in the prefrontal and parietal lobes. The Borg might be trying to terminate their link with him. Negative. The subspace signal configuration is unchanged. What is causing the neural activity is unclear. No, it's not. It's him. It's Picard. Troi to bridge. Data has made first contact with Capt Picard. Can you communicate with him? I have been unable to create a path around the Borg implant. It is Capt Picard himself who has managed to initiate contact. The Borg have halted their approach to Earth. We've got their attention. Time to intercept? Two minutes, four seconds. They are worried because we have access to Picard. Mr. Data, we have two minutes to figure out what to do. Sir, the Borg are either unwilling or unable to terminate their subspace links. That may be their Achilles heel. Their interdependency. What do you mean? He's part of their consciousness. Cutting him off would be like asking us to disconnect an arm. We can't do it. They operate as a single mind. One of them jumps off a cliff, they all jump off? Data, can we plant a command into the Borg consciousness? It is conceivable. But it would require altering the pathway from the root command to all branch points... Make every effort, Mr. Data. Sir, what command shall I attempt to plant? Something straightforward, like, ""Disarm your weapons systems. "" Visual contact with the Borg. On screen. Magnify. Increased power generation from the Borg. Red alert. Load all torpedo bays. Ready phasers. Aye, Captain. Status of Borg weapons? Their weapons are fully charged. Data? Attempting to re-route subcommand paths. Defense systems are protected by access barriers. Borg attempting to lock on. Rotate shield frequencies. Data? I am unable to penetrate defense-systems command. See if you can get them to power down. Acknowledged. Attempting new power subcommand path. Shields have failed. They've locked on, sir. They're pulling us in. Fire all weapons. I cannot penetrate Borg power subcommand structure. All subcommands are protected. Then it's over. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg. You heard me. A collision course. Yes, sir. Mr. La Forge, prepare to go to warp power. Aye, sir. Sleep. He's regaining consciousness. Sleep. It's Capt Picard speaking, not Locutus. Sleep, Data. He's exhausted. Yes, Doctor. But if I may make a supposition, I do not believe his message was intended to express fatigue, but to suggest a course of action. Borg cutting beam activated. Mr. Crusher? Engage... Data to bridge. Stand by. Stand by, all stations. I am trying to penetrate the Borg regenerative subcommand path. It is a low-priority system and may be accessible. Warning. Outer hull breach. Sir, shall I execute evacuation? Negative. Data, your final report. Stand by. I can't, Mr. Data. Warning. Inner-hull failure imminent on decks 23, 24 and 25. Decompression danger. Mr. Data, what the hell happened? I planted a command into the Borg collective consciousness. It misdirected them to believe it was time to regenerate. In effect, I put them all to sleep. To sleep? Yes, sir. Status of Borg power drive? Minimal power. Electromagnetic field? Non-existent. Cmdr Shelby, take an away team and confirm that the Borg are asleep. Delighted, sir. Mr. Worf. Shelby to Enterprise. It's true. They're all in a regeneration mode. They're dormant, sir. Any indication as to how long for? Checking. Tricoder readings are fluctuating rapidly. There are indications that their entire power net is about to feed back on itself. I'd say we're looking at a self-destruct sequence. Shall we try to disarm it? Stand by. We don't know what destroying the Borg ship will do to him. We should consider further examination of the Borg vessel, sir. I don't think so. Data, separate yourself from Capt Picard. Away team, come home. Mr. Crusher, move us to a safe position. Aye, sir. Life signs are stable. The DNA around the microcircuit implants is returning to normal. How do you feel? Almost human. With just... a bit of a headache. We'll get you to sickbay and get those implants out. How much do you remember? Everything. Including some brilliantly unorthodox strategy from a former first officer of mine. They're ready to begin refitting the Enterprise. Estimated time for repairs? Five or six weeks. Come. Request permission to disembark, sir. Permission granted. They picked a fine officer for the task force. We'll have the fleet back up in less than a year. You'll have your choice of any Starfleet command, sir. Everyone is so concerned about my next job. With all due respect, Commander, sir, my career plans are my own business, and no one else's. But it's nice to know I have a few options. I hope I have the fortune of serving with you again. Captain. Course for Station McKinley laid in. Make it so, Number One. "
S4E02,"Captain's log, star date 44012.3. The Enterprise remains at McKinley Station, undergoing an overhaul following the Borg incident. I am confident the ship and her crew will soon return to service. Thank you. Please take that to Engineering. Phaser upgrades are complete. Already? We have begun power-supply calibration. You're too damned efficient. Thank you, sir. Continue testing. Here's the shore leave and personnel transfers. I look forward to meeting your parents. Sir? They're on the visitors' list. You didn't know? No, sir. It is inappropriate for a Klingon to receive family while on duty. As humans, my parents do not understand. I'm not sure that I would either, since this isn't a Klingon ship. If you don't want to see your parents, OK. But we don't often get to Earth. Go off-duty while they're here. No,... sir. That will not be necessary. Dismissed. Mr. Worf? You're worried they'll learn what happened on the Klingon planet? Not at all. I have already informed them of my discommendation. I do not believe any human can truly understand my dishonour. So, where have you decided to go? What? France. Labarre. My home village. Really? Yes. First time in almost 20 years. Interesting. Counsellor... I just find it interesting. Capt Jean-Luc Picard, who wouldn't take a vacation for three years! It's Earth. It's home. Do I need another reason? I don't know. What do you think? Your help has been invaluable during my recovery. But, look. I'm... I'm better! The injuries are healing. Those you can see in the mirror. The nightmares have ended. All I need now is a little time to myself. I agree. In fact, I'm delighted you're going. It's just that the choice of where you're going could stand some scrutiny. If you wish to believe that my going home is a result of being captured by the Borg, be my guest. Is that what you believe? I hate it when you do that. Captain. You do need time. You cannot achieve complete recovery so quickly. It's normal, after what you've been through, to spend a great deal of time trying to find yourself again. And what better place to do it than in one's home village? Interesting. Have a good trip, Captain. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. They still have not signaled? No, sir. My mother is never on time. It is so human of her. Well, you know women. I am not looking forward to this. I wish they'd come so it would end sooner! I know what you mean, sir. Unlikely. Last time my old man was on board, he chased Nurse Stanton round a bio bed. My father doesn't chase nurses. It's always something, isn't it? Enterprise, this is Earth Station Bobruisk. Two to transport aboard. Energizing. Mother. Father. Worf. You look good, son. Put on a little weight. No. Sure you have. Looks good. Still working out with holodeck monsters? Let me take you to... Always good to meet another chief petty officer! Sergey Rozhenko, formerly of USS Intrepid. Miles Edward O'Brien, sir. Don't call me ""sir"". I used to work for a living. He's joking. His proudest moment was when Worf earned his commission. Imagine. An old enlisted man like me raising a boy to be an officer! Come along, Sergey. There is plenty of time to chat with the boys. Your father has been so looking forward to this. Yes, I want to see everything. The whole ship. I have all the specs and diagrams of the Galaxy-class starships. We are in the midst of a repair. I cannot give you a complete tour! I'm sure if you ask the Captain... You agreed not to embarrass him. Besides, we have come to see Worf, not the ship. Fine. OK. Your hair is a little longer, isn't it, Worf? Alright. Whoever you are, I can hear you. Good Lord! A highwayman! A what? A highwayman. A robber who attacks travellers. But none have been reported here for centuries. But I'm not a robber! I'm much relieved, sir. I know who you are. Then you have the advantage. You're my nephew, Jean-Luc, from the Starship Enterprise. You must be my Uncle René. I'm not your uncle. It's the other way around. Too bad. I enjoyed the idea. Why have you been away so long? Starfleet keeps me very busy. Father says you don't like it here. You misunderstood. No, I didn't. He said so. Well, Robert and l, we... Perhaps it's time to change all that. You know, you don't seem so arro... Arro... You know. Arrogant? Yes, arrogant. You don't seem that way to me. What does it mean anyway, ""arrogant son of a...""? Let's talk about that later, shall we? Mummy, he's here! Mummy! He's here! Jean-Luc. Marie. It is so good to finally meet you. For me, too. How are you feeling? I'm fine. Robert and I are delighted you've come to stay. I was... I was thinking I might be imposing. I could stay in the village. I wouldn't hear of it. It's your home and always will be. Do things look that different? No. In fact, it's amazing how little it has changed. Everything is exactly as I remember it. The house, hills... Every tree, every bush... ..seems untouched by the passage of time. Robert's worked hard to keep it that way. It's very important to him. As it was to our father. Someday, I'm going to be a starship captain. You look exactly like Robert when he was your age. I half expect to see myself as a boy, come running out of that door to play. Robert can't wait to see you. René has already told me. Where is he? As usual. With his vines. So, you arrived at last. Welcome home, Captain. Hello, Robert. You've... ..shuttled in from the village? No, I decided to walk. I met Marie and René. Good. Good. It's... ..good to see you. Are you tired? No. Make yourself at home. You know where everything is. We generally eat about eight. I must try and cure this poor, sick vine. I'll see you shortly. You'll have a chance to visit the surface? Maybe. Will and I have talked about going back to Angel Falls. Venezuela's beautiful. Come in. Great. Thank you. Something from home? I stored it here a long time ago, after Jack died. Odds and ends, mostly. How to Advance Your Career Through Marriage? It was a joke. Jack sent it to me in medical school. It was his way of proposing. What's that? It's for Wesley, from Jack. I'd forgotten it. Maybe I was just trying to forget it. Why? Jack recorded a holographic message just after Wesley was born. It was a gift for him when he grew up. Jack was going to make many more of them. He never had the chance. Afraid of what it might say? No, but it could do more harm than good. Wesley's finally come to terms with his father's death. Wesley has questions about his father, things you can't answer. Perhaps seeing this will help him understand. Check completed, sir. So we walked into the school not knowing what to expect. Is Worf hurt? Is he in trouble? The door opens and there is our little seven-year-old sitting on the chair, glaring at five teenage boys with bloody noses! The Principal looked up and said, ""Please, tell me he's an only child!"" We have taken enough of the Commander's time. No. We're ahead of schedule. I wanted to tell the story... Enough stories, Sergey. OK. Enough stories. Well, how about a look at the new engine core? I was a warp-field specialist. I'd be delighted. Mrs. Rozhenko? No. You two go ahead. Your father will be hours. Worf, why don't you show me the arboretum? Cmdr La Forge, call me when you... when my father wishes to leave. I can find my own way. Turbo lift four is... just over there, right? I have all the specs and diagrams at home. The theta-matrix compositor makes recrystallisation ten times more efficient than before. Amazing. Commander, if you have time, there is something else I want to ask. Sure, Chief. It's about my son. Your friend Louis wants you to call as soon as you're settled. Is he still trying to raise the ocean floor? Yes. He's very excited about it. He's a supervisor now, as his wife constantly reminds anyone who'll listen. I see no good reason why the Earth should have another subcontinent. It's exciting, the potential of exploring a new world on our own planet. Well, I'm afraid that I do not understand this potential. The Mayor wants to give you a parade. Thank you. A parade? Give you the keys to the city. No. He just needs a little arm-twisting. Some coaxing. No, he does not. I'm here to rest and spend time with my family. I told the Mayor not to make plans without talking to us. Thank you. So... Salut. Salut. Is this the '46? '47. You've been drinking too much artificial stuff. What do you call it? Synthehol? It's spoiled you. Ruined your palate. On the contrary. It heightens one's appreciation for the genuine article. Delicious, Marie! Thank you. Leave it to Robert to find the best cook in France... and marry her. Yes, but sadly, cooking is becoming a lost art. Your wretched technology again. Robert and I have discussed getting a replicator in the house. I remember the same discussions between Mother and Father. Father understood better than anyone the danger of losing those values which we hold most precious. Why do you have to lose anything just by adding a convenience? Well, you wouldn't, but in my view, life is already too convenient. This is a very old argument. It is. I wrote a report on starships for school. And he won a ribbon for it. The teacher said it was the best he'd heard. Good for you, Uncle. I once wrote a report on starships when I was your age. Did you win a ribbon, too? I don't recall. And I don't find your modesty very convincing, brother. Of course you won. You always did. Do you still have it? Your report. No, I don't think so. Well, I still have mine. Why don't you get it? Then you can read it to your uncle. It's hard enough to protect him... ..to protect him from all that's out there without you encouraging him. I'm not encouraging him. If you weren't so narrow-minded, and let him see the world as it is... You raise your own sons as you would wish and allow me to do the same with mine. One man's idea of paradise. No, Louis, two men. Robert's and my father's. Never did I know anyone less interested in grapes than you. No. Not true! I was interested. And I was proud that my family were helping to preserve traditions. I just didn't feel bound by those traditions. You always reached for the future and your brother for the past. There should be room for both in this life. What about you, you old rascal? You've shifted into the future, too. Hydroponics turned out to be dull. You should have listened to me. If I'd listened to you, I'd never have gone cycling with the Bloom sisters. And broken your leg. And got married twice. So you're supervisor of the Atlantis Project. One of 200 supervisors. My wife would have you believe I run the entire project. Well, it's very exciting work. I've kept up on it in the journals. Really? It's only... There's just one thing I don't understand. You were such a rotten swimmer, Louis. Thinking of you working on the ocean floor... I suppose we all find ways to confront our greatest fears. How will you accelerate the build-up under the mantle without stressing the tectonic plates? You really have kept up, haven't you? The truth is, we don't know... yet. On the Enterprise, we used harmonic resonators to relieve tectonic pressures on Drema IV. It's not the same, but... It's such a shame. The government wants someone to take over. A leader who'll get things moving. And they are looking for you. I know, you'd never leave Starfleet. No, I'd never leave Starfleet. That's what I thought, but why don't I send over some of the studies, since you're interested? We could use any thoughts you have. Alright. It's a great crew, son. And they think the world of you. They really do. Mother, Father, l... I wish you would be a little more... reserved while you are on board. I know. We go too far, sometimes. We're just excited to be here. Riker to Lt Worf. Worf here. I need to talk about the phaser test results. On my way, sir. Have Guinan call me if you need anything. Maybe we should leave it alone. I can't just leave it alone. I'm his mother. Sooner or later, everyone comes in here. They stand by those windows and look out and they stare. They're looking for that little star they call home. It doesn't matter how far away it is. Everybody looks anyway. I'm Guinan. Pleased to meet you. You're Worf's parents? Sergey and Helena. Welcome. Sit, please. There's something I want to ask you. Please. How come you never gave him prune juice? I beg your pardon? He never had it till he came here. Now he can't get enough. Worf? He never wanted human food while he was growing up. Everything had to be Klingon. I learned to cook rokeg blood pie. However, we never quite learned how to eat it! It was a difficult adolescence. But you got through it. We did nothing special. Didn't you? Just look at him. I think he's pretty special. We knew it wouldn't be easy for him, growing up without other Klingons to turn to. We had to let him discover and explore his heritage by himself, let him find his own path. So many parents could learn so much from the two of you. Well, I'm afraid that Worf feels that we do not understand him. Well, part of him may feel that way. But there's another part that I've seen. A part that comes in and drinks prune juice. A part that looks out the window towards home. He's not looking towards the Klingon Empire. He's looking towards you. Jean-Luc? Are you alright? I seem to have made a rather disturbing discovery. Louis mentioned that the Atlantis Project needed a director. I found myself actually thinking about it! Why shouldn't you? Leaving my career, the Enterprise? After what you've been through... No, no. It's not that. Or is it? It would be wonderful to have you back home. Given time, maybe you and Robert might get to like one another. I already like his choice in wives. Thank you for your correspondence. It made me feel like part of the family. You're not like part of the family. You are part of the family. Don't worry, dear. I've got it. Robert. Louis. Come in. Let me get you some wine. You can talk business. Business? Not much to talk about. I'm interested in what you thought of our plans. I've only glanced at them. I've had a few ideas. Wonderful! We should discuss them. I've set up a meeting. Meeting? Just a preliminary conversation. Tomorrow morning? Preliminary to what? They want you. I mentioned your interest in the project. They jumped at the prospect. There isn't a prospect. At least listen to them. Alright. Good. Fine. I'll listen. You won't regret it. I promise. See you in the morning. I don't understand, Mom. What kind of message? I don't know exactly. Your father made it a few weeks after you were born. Why? He felt it was important to say certain things. And to make sure he didn't forget to tell you them later. Do you know what it says? No. But he wanted you to have this when you turned 18. I want you to have it, too. Enter. Are we disturbing you? No. I thought you were going to sleep. We just came to tuck you in. Please. When I heard you were on the visitors' list,... ..l was not sure I wanted you to come. I am glad you are here. We had to come. Our boy was in trouble. We read your letter about the discommendation from the Klingons. We didn't understand it all. We didn't have to. We know what kind of man you are. Whatever you did, we know it was for a good reason. I must bear my dishonour alone. That is not true. I'm sorry if this is too human of us, but whatever you are suffering, you must remember we are with you. And that we're proud of you. And that we love you. You are our son. Careful! You're not used to drinking the real thing. This synthehol never leaves you out of control. Is that so? That's so. Well, this will. Now, there is something I'd like to see. What's that? The gallant Captain out of control. Mind if I ask you a question? What the devil happened to you up there? Is this brotherly concern? No. Curiosity. What did they do to you? You know what happened. Not precisely. I gather you were hurt. Humiliated. I always thought you needed a little humiliation. Or was it humility? Either would do. Why do you walk away? That isn't your style. I'm tired of fighting with you. Tired? That's right! Yes. Tired of the Enterprise, too? The great Capt Picard of Starfleet falls to Earth, ready to plunge into the water with Louis. That isn't the brother that I remember. Still, I suppose it must have seemed the ideal situation. Local boy makes good. Returns home after 20 years to a hero's welcome. I'm not a hero. Of course you are. Admit it. You'd never settle for less. That's not true! Cancel the parade? In your favour? No! I never sought that rubbish! Never sought? Never sought president of the school, valedictorian, athletic hero with your arms raised in victory? Valedictorian? Arms raised in victory? Were you so jealous? Yes, damn it! I was always so jealous and I had a right to be! A right? I was always your brother, watching you receive the cheers, watching you break every rule our father made and get away with it! Why didn't you break rules? I was the responsible elder brother. It was my job to look after you. Look after me? You were a bully! Sometimes, maybe. Sometimes I even enjoyed bullying you. Alright. Try it now. Why did you come back, Jean-Luc? Did you come back because you wanted me to look after you again? Damn you! You were asking for it, you know. Yes, but you needed it. You have been terribly hard on yourself. You don't know, Robert. You don't know. They took everything I was. They used me to kill and to destroy, and I couldn't stop them. I should have been able to stop them! I tried. I tried so hard! But I wasn't strong enough! I wasn't good enough! I should have been able to stop them! I should! I should! So... ..my brother is a human being after all. This is going to be with you a long time, Jean-Luc. A long time. You have to learn to live with it. You have a simple choice now. Live with it below the sea with Louis. Or above the clouds with the Enterprise. You know, I think you were right after all. I think I did come back so that you could help me. You know what? I still don't like you, Jean-Luc! What in the world...?! What happened here? It's entirely my fault, Marie. I fell down. Then he fell down. Then we both fell down. We both fell down together. Have you two been fighting? Fighting? No. Certainly not. No. Shame on you both. What would your father say if he saw you like this? He'd probably send us to bed without supper. Perhaps it's just as well you got it out of your systems. Perhaps it was, Marie. Perhaps it was. I'll contact Louis and cancel the meeting. It's time that I was going. Already? The ship will be ready to leave orbit soon. I belong aboard. If I should ever doubt that again, I know where to come. Computer, load program, Crusher one. Program complete. Enter when ready. Run program. Hello, Wesley. As I make this recording, you are about ten weeks old. I wanted you to know who I am today. This Jack Crusher won't exist by the time you're grown up. I'll be older, more experienced and, hopefully, a little wiser. But this person will be gone, and I want you to know who I was when you came into the world. When I see you lying there, in your crib, I realize I don't know the first thing about being a father. So let me apologize for all the mistakes I'm about to make. I hope you don't grow up resenting the fact I was gone so much. That comes with this uniform. I don't know if I can explain why Starfleet means so much to me. Maybe you'll understand when you get this recording. Maybe you'll even want to try one of these on. But you'll probably be a doctor, like your mother. You're only a baby, but it's remarkable. I see in your face all the people I've loved in my lifetime. Your mother, my father and mother. Our family. I can see me in you, too. And I can feel that you're my son. I don't know how to describe it, but there's this connection, this bond. I'll always be a part of you, Wesley. Well, I hope this makes some sense to you. I'm not sure that it does to me, but maybe I'll do better next time. I love you, Wesley. Goodbye, Dad. Come back and see us again. Goodbye, Jean-Luc. And be careful. Take care, Uncle. You, too. Someday, I'll leave for my starship, too. Plenty of time for that. You may decide to do something else. Jean-Luc, here is a little of the '47. Do not drink it all at once, and if possible, try not to drink it alone. Is there anything you want us to send you from home? No. Perhaps some of your rokeg blood pie. It's been a while, but I think I still remember how. Captain. Welcome back. Thank you. These are my parents, Helena and Sergey. Delighted. Sir. Quite a ship you have, Captain. You had the full tour? There are still a few areas due to repairs... Sergey. Time to go. Yes. Yes. Yes. OK. I have all the specs and diagrams at home. He's still out there. Dreaming about starships and adventures. It's getting late. Yes. But let him dream. "
S4E04,"Captain's log, star date 44143.7. We have moved into Sector 21947 in response to a distress call from a Talarian observation craft. The alien vessel appears adrift, and our scans detect a life-threatening radiation leak within its propulsion system. No further response. Maintain an open channel. Dr Crusher is in transporter room three. Sir, during the Galen border conflict, it was a common tactic of the Talarians to abandon their craft, rig them to self-destruct... And issue a general distress call. Yes, I know. That guerrilla manoeuvre resulted in 219 fatalities in three days. Can we detect a self-destruct device? Negative, sir. The Talarians use a subspace proximity detonator. It is not detectable by our scans. Or the away team's tricorders. Right. The Talarian warship, the Q'Maire, is answering the distress call. Position? In the Woden Sector. It'll take them hours to get here. Counsellor? There is life on board and it's fading. Assemble the away team. Prepare for rescue operations. Yes, sir. Ancillary power is failing. They're nothing more than children. I am Cmdr Riker of the starship Enterprise. We will evacuate you. You will not be harmed. Prepping five Talarian males to be transported to sickbay. Trauma team, stand by. Radiation burns, possible respiratory distress. Transport locked in. Stand by for my orders. Captain, this appears to be a basic training ship. Five boys, all teens, all wearing uniforms. Proceed with the evacuation. No other life signs aboard. Commander, quickly. What is it? This boy's human. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, supplemental. We have completed an evacuation of four Talarians and one human. How this young man found himself amongst these aliens is a mystery. It's Jono, right? Is that what I heard them call you? I'm Dr Crusher. I'm checking for radiation injuries. It won't hurt. I have a son not much older than you. Perhaps you'd like to meet him. Well, Jono, you seem to have escaped radiation damage. Pretty lucky. Dr Crusher. Now how did this happen? What is it? They're terrified. They all just started up. Please may I have your attention? Please may I have your attention? Stop that immediately! Well, that's better. Now, what's your name, young man? He won't talk, Captain. We haven't been able to get through to him. Captain. I am Jono. Take me home to my captain. Take me home to Endar. He escaped radiation trauma, but the scan shows something else. Two previously fractured ribs, a broken arm and concussion. There might be neurological damage. I'd like to examine him further. The Talarians are known to be ruthless to their enemies. I think there's a possibility they may have brutalized the child. Isn't it possible the injuries were caused prior to his captivity? Not likely. He's been with them a long time. Long enough to assimilate their cultural traits. Calcium traces show that the injuries took place in the past seven years. If they abused him, why would he wish to return to them? It's not uncommon. It was identified centuries ago as the Stockholm Syndrome. Jono! What is it? Jono! I just suggested he take off his gloves. He lost control. Security, we need assistance. Jono! She wants to dissect me! She wants to help you. I don't want her help! Send us back to Capt Endar! Jono, I want you to stop this immediately! Yes, Captain. Good. That's better. If we're to accomplish anything... Data to Picard. Go ahead. We have received a communiqué from Starfleet about the young human. Very well. Doctor, Counsellor. Lt Worf, escort this young man to quarters. He is to be confined until further notice. Yes, Doctor. Why are you here, Klingon, with them? Did they capture you, too? They are not my captors. They are my comrades. Why do you take orders from a female? Dr Crusher. She is my superior officer. Among my people, a female can never outrank a man. You are human. Among humans, females can achieve anything the males can. I am no more human than you are. I am Talarian. You are confused. Stop that! I will make the B'Nar, the mourning, until I am back with my brothers. By matching DNA gene types, Starfleet identified the boy as Jeremiah Rossa. Rossa? As in Admiral Rossa? She is his grandmother. He was born 14 years ago on the Federation colony Galen IV. His parents, Connor and Moira, were killed three years, nine months later, when the Talarians invaded. I remember. No survivors. The boy was listed as missing, presumed dead. Another Rossa died at the Krasner Outpost. Tragedy follows that family. The Admiral lost both her sons. Now she has something to celebrate. If Jeremiah goes to his family in this condition, it will be a wrenching experience for everyone. Especially him. He needs to rediscover his identity, connect with his roots. I agree. Do what you can to accomplish that. I don't think I can do anything. Why not? Troi is right. It's clear that the boy does not respond well to women. The Talarians are a rigidly patriarchal society. Jeremiah needs to build a relationship with a man, a father figure with whom he can explore his origins. I think it should be you, Captain. No, Counsellor. No, Counsellor. I don't think so. He needs someone trained in these matters. You are the only person with whom he has shown any connection. If he is to find his humanity, then you are the only one who can help him. It's up to you, Captain. Jono! Why do you make that noise? It is our custom when we are in distress. Isn't it also your custom to listen to your captain? Yes. Then as Captain of the Enterprise, I ask you not to make that sound. Yes, sir. Good. Well, now that's cleared up, let's... Let's... Let's get acquainted, shall we? What do you think of your room? I know it's a little sterile. But if there's anything you would like... Pictures, perhaps. Games. This is a cage. I'm still your captive. No. Not at all. I thought you'd be comfortable here. Will you return me to my captain? We rendezvous with the warship Q'Maire at 0740 hours. We will transfer the Talarians to Capt Endar. Including me? We'll discuss your situation with Capt Endar. I don't like this place. We could find other quarters. I've always lived with my Captain. Yes, well, that wouldn't work here. There's nothing here to appeal to a young person. Put that down, please. It's Klingon. Yes. Would you put it back? Well... Here we are, eh, Jono? You haven't taken off your gloves. Not here. Why not? So that I don't have to touch an alien. Jono, your captain, Endar... Has he ever hurt you? Inflicted pain? Pain is not a consideration. Then he has? I did not say that. Don't you understand? Pain is not what matters. Passing the tests is everything. Is that what they are? Tests of pain? You understand nothing. It's true, I don't fully understand Talarians. But you are not Talarian. I will not listen to this. I will not listen to your lies. Come. You wanted to see me? Yes, Counsellor. Please, sit down. You're probably not aware of this, but I've never been comfortable around children. Really? For some reason, they just don't seem to respond to me. I see. Frankly, I think that my time would be best served doing the duties and responsibilities of a Starfleet captain. Seldom have I heard an explanation so well-rehearsed. Look, Counsellor... I just feel that I am not the right person for this job. Strange, isn't it? You'll travel light years, dodge asteroid storms, brave hostile aliens, and yet when asked to assume a parental role, you cringe. Why do you suppose that is? I'm not cringing. I'm just... ..acknowledging my limitations. As a child, did you have any friends? Other children you played with? I don't think that this has anything to do with anything. Well, perhaps it was because... This is foolish. What were you going to say? It's just that... ever since I was a child, I've known exactly what I wanted to do. Be a member of Starfleet. Nothing else mattered. Virtually my entire youth was spent in the pursuit of that goal. In fact, I probably skipped my childhood altogether. You know, Captain, almost no one is born being a good parent. Most people muddle through and do the best that they can. That's what I'll have to do? Yes. And you might be surprised at just how good you can be. Computer, turn off that noise! Computer, what... What was that? The Alba Ra, a contemporary Talarian musical form. Jono? Jono, where are you? You turned off my music. Yes, I most certainly did. And I expect it to stay turned off. Would you come down from there? I see you made yourself at home. I cannot rest on your beds. They hurt my back. Come here. There's something I want to show you. Those are Connor and Moira... Rossa. They are your parents. The baby... is you. Jeremiah Rossa. My name is Jono. Well, you were born Jeremiah on Galen IV. The colony was destroyed later during a border skirmish. You see? You knew how to laugh once. Do you remember this? Your parents? Your home? I know that Endar rescued me. He told me so. Jono, your parents were killed by the Talarians. It was war. Death is part of war. Captain. Yes, what is it? We have visual contact with the warship Q'Maire. Endar! You... stay put. I'm on my way, Number One. Get to cover! I can't leave you! Take Jeremiah to the forest. I'll hold them off. No! Come with us! Jeremiah! Momma! Status, Mr. Data? Q'Maire at station, holding steady at bearing 013, mark 015. Distance, 506 kilometres. Are its weapons systems active? Negative, sir. Capt Endar requests an open channel. On screen. I am Capt Endar of the warship Q'Maire. To whom am I speaking? Capt Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise. We rescued four crew members from your observation craft. They have had medical attention and are ready for transport. Your actions are noted. We will forward coordinates for transport. You're welcome, I'm sure. One moment, Captain. We have also discovered a human among your crew. Jono. Actually, his name is Jeremiah. Jeremiah Rossa. What is his condition? Is he injured? He was not wounded in the mishap, but as a representative of the Federation, I require an explanation. Why has this child been held in your custody for so many years? No explanation is warranted, Captain. He is my son. Captain's log, supplemental. Capt Endar's claim that Jeremiah is his son is unacceptable. However, to avoid escalating tensions, I have invited the Talarian leader to come aboard so that we may address the issue face to face. I was in charge of the force that repelled the trespassers on Galen IV. I must say your Federation troops fought tenaciously. Among them, Connor and Moira Rossa. I suppose. After the battle, I found a squalling child by the body of a young woman, his mother presumably. There was almost no one left alive on Galen IV. Was I to leave him screaming over her body? You should have told the Federation. To conceal him was a violation of our agreement. I took him in accordance with my people's traditions. What tradition empowered you to capture a helpless child? I lost my son at the hands of humans during the conflict over Castal I. Talarian custom allows me to claim the son of a slain enemy. Does that custom extend to brutalizing this surrogate son? What are you talking about? Our Medical Officer discovered signs of injuries so severe, they might be considered torture. Nonsense. I've never harmed Jono. Explain the fractured ribs, concussion, broken arm. Broken arm? Youth! Have you ever been a father, Picard? Have you ever had a son desperately trying to win your approval, your respect? Jono broke his ribs riding on a t'stayan. Six hooves. A very powerful beast. The arm, in a contest with other youths. He endured the pain and won the competition. One day, he will be a great warrior. Doesn't he deserve to become more than that? His true heritage is human, Endar. A heritage long since forgotten. You are welcome to supervise the return of your crew, but I cannot allow Jeremiah to be returned to you. His true family are waiting for him on Earth. Then under no circumstances will I allow your ship to leave our territory. I have reported our position and this violation to Starfleet. And I have called for reserve forces into this sector. Are you saying you would go to war over this boy? Would you not for your only son? We have been at peace for years. Let us not rush headlong into war. Then help me to avoid it. If you will allow me to see Jono, it will be clear to you I have been a good father. He's grown up happy in my keeping. You think it unwise to let Endar see Jono? It might be dangerous. Abusers have subtle but powerful influence over their victims. I'm not convinced the boy has been abused. I've talked with the father. If I'm any judge of character, I'd say he cares deeply for the boy's welfare. I sense awakening memories in the boy. This is a very fragile time for Jono. If we send away the man he calls Father without letting them see each other, how will we ever gain his trust? Yes. There is something else. We are deep in Talarian territory. A semblance of diplomacy is needed. I'll agree to the meeting. All I ask is that the visit be supervised. Don't let them be alone together. Agreed. Endar. Jono, my son. Have they treated you well? Yes, Captain. Except... Except what? I was forbidden to make the B'Nar. That's alright. I know you've mourned in your heart. Well, Jono, what do you think of these humans? They look like me. They want to keep you, you know. Yes, I know. You've reached the Age of Decision. What is your choice? Do you want to stay? No. Of course not. Then you shall not. I'm returning to the Q'Maire. I will give the humans a choice. If they do not make the one we know is right, it may lead to war. You may die. I am ready to die. Sensors indicate two warships approaching along the border. Mr. Data, what's their offensive potential? Talarian warships have neutral particle weapons, X-ray lasers and Merculite rockets. No match for the Enterprise. I don't want to be forced into destroying their ships. They won't back off. They've been willing to fight to the death in past encounters. The lines are being drawn. All this for a chosen son. Captain. Is it worth it, to go to war over a child? You might not ask that if it was your child. There must be a way to avoid this. If we can just reach Jono, help him make connections with his origins, he may choose to come with us. You think Endar will go along with that? If Endar respects Talarian custom, he may have to. According to their tradition, a male child of 14 has reached the Age of Decision. He undergoes a ceremony of initiation. Then he may make his own choices. Endar's entire claim on Jono is based on Talarian custom. He'd have a hard time backing away from it now. There's a communication from Starfleet Command. On screen. Sir. The message is for Jeremiah Rossa. Have the boy brought to my ready room. Jeremiah? My name is Connaught Rossa. I am your father's mother. I wish we could talk in person but that will have to wait. When I heard the miracle that you were alive, I wanted to reach out to you. I find myself wondering what you look like. All I can do is imagine your father at your age. You come from a family that would make you proud. Many of them have given their lives to bring peace to the galaxy. You are the last of the Rossas. I was so very thankful that you were given back to us to carry on the line. Your grandfather and I will greet you with all the love in our hearts. Have a safe journey home, Jeremiah. She wears a Starfleet uniform. Yes. What is her rank? She's an admiral. She outranks you? Yes. If I were home now, I'd run along the river as fast as I could! Jono. I can't do the things that calm me here. You won't let me have my music or make the B'Nar. I feel if I stay still much longer, I will die! Jono. Let me show you what I do when I have these feelings. Come on. Now, you can serve from within either of these two sections by bouncing the ball and hitting it into that top target. You have to return the ball before it bounces twice. Alright? Let's try it. Not bad. I win at all the games. I can believe it. Jono. You alright? I'm fine. Momma! Jeremiah! No! Momma! It's alright. It's alright. She was all red. I cried. She didn't answer me. She used to sing to me. I don't remember the melody, just the sound of her voice. Before I remembered these things, I was strong. And now... It's part of being human, Jono. But as deeply as you feel hurt, you can also feel joy. I do not think so. I think I will always feel like this. How was the racquetball? Quite a game for his first time. I'm looking forward to next time. I'm sure you are. Sit down. What would you like? What is that? A banana split, possibly one of the greatest things in the universe. Here, try some. That is called a spoon. Forgive me. I fail to understand why this is amusing. Access your data banks under ""humour, slapstick"". Comedy stressing farce and horseplay. This, no doubt, is a variation on ""pie in the face""? Now do you see why it's funny? No, sir. But I will take your word for it. This is very amusing. Let's try this again. A fresh banana split and another for my friend. Right away. Look at him. He's a different person. Who would have thought we'd ever see him laugh out loud? Just half an hour ago, he was crying like a baby. Single-plane penetration. I need the auto suture. Yes, Doctor. The blade hit the sternum and was deflected. It could have been worse. Then it wasn't a dream. I'm afraid not. No vital organs pierced, no major arteries. Where is the boy now? Worf has him in security. Hold still! I want to see him. Here. Now. He'll wait until I'm finished. Talarian warships converging. Range, 500 kilometres. On screen. Any communication, Lt Worf? No. We have an open channel. The warships' velocities are slowing. Staggered approach vectors bearing zero, 120 and 240 degrees. Riker to La Forge. La Forge here, sir. The Talarians are in attack posture. Triangular envelopment. I'll get more power to the shields. We're ready. The Captain of the Q'Maire requests communication. Here we go. On screen. Capt Picard, have you made your decision? This is Cmdr Riker. What are your intentions? Where is Capt Picard? He has been injured. I am in command now. Very well. Please prepare my son for immediate transport. That won't be possible. Last night, Jono attacked Capt Picard and tried to murder him. We're holding him in custody. If he had been returned to me, this would never have happened. I hold you responsible for this incident. He has to come with us now. Starfleet will decide the consequences. I do not accept that decision. I repeat. You will prepare my son for immediate transport. If he is not aboard the Q'Maire in five minutes... ..you will suffer the consequences. Red alert. Talarians routeing power to rockets. Ready all weapons, Mr. Worf. Jono. Why did you do it? That does not matter. Yes, I think it does. It matters to me. What matters is that I attacked a captain. I am ready to be put to death. You think you are going to be killed? To attack a superior is the worst offence. I will die at your hands. Jono, you're not going to die at my hands or anyone else's. But I committed a terrible crime. What I want to know is why. You seemed so happy just a few hours ago. I was. But then I thought about my father. I felt that I had betrayed him. I'd be throwing away all that he'd given me. All that I'd learned from him. My home, running along the river, playing in the games,... ..sharing victory with my brothers. All the things that are a part of my life. As I grew closer and closer to you,... ..l knew that meant leaving more and more of that life behind. Forgive me, Captain, but I cannot allow myself to do that. The Q'Maire requests communications. On screen. Cmdr Riker, you have failed to transport my son to the Q'Maire. Our intentions have not changed. He will return to Starfleet. I regret your stubbornness. Much will be lost. One moment, Captain. Capt Endar. Last night, Jono... attacked me with a dagger. Which he could not have done had he been returned. A crime was committed on board, but it was not Jono's. It was mine. When we found Jono, it seemed so clear what had to be done. We knew that if we could only persuade him to make the decision to stay, then you would most likely let him. With the best intentions, we tried to convince him, and in so doing,... ..we thoroughly failed to listen to his feelings, to his needs. That was the crime. And it has taken a huge toll on a strong and a very... ..noble young man. And it must be rectified. He will return home. To the only home he's ever known. And to the father that he loves. To you, Endar. Thank you, Captain. Please transmit coordinates for immediate transport. Goodbye, Jono. Goodbye, Captain. Thank you. "
S4E05,"Chief Medical Officer's log, star date 44161.2. We are docking at Starbase 133 for scheduled crew rotation. I look forward to welcoming my mentor and dear friend, Dr Dalen Quaice, who will travel with us to his home planet, Kenda II. Dalen! Good to see you again, Beverly. You look wonderful. A lie I can live with. It's kind of your captain to ferry me home. It was on our way. Thanks, O'Brien. My pleasure, Doctor. I'm sorry about Patricia. She'd been ill for some time. Is her death the reason you're giving up your post? We had a lifetime together, doing all the things we'd dreamed. And more. But when she was gone, I couldn't continue to work in that office, sleep in that bed without her. The absence of her was too distracting. I'm not sure that I'm making any sense. Jack and I only had a few short years together, but I understand. When you realize someone you love is lost forever... You know the worst part of growing old? So many of the people you've known all your life are gone. You realize you didn't take the time to appreciate them while you could. I'm sorry. There's no reason to load this emotional baggage on you. I usually travel light. Experiment time is over. I want my warp engines back. I'm almost done. Almost isn't good enough. What if the Captain says ""Engage"" and we just sit here? A few more minutes. I'm ready to try the new warp field. Mom. Don't let me interrupt. Wesley! Right, OK. Computer, run a level-two diagnostic on warp-drive systems. Antimatter containment positive. Warp drive within normal parameters. Wesley, talk to me. That shouldn't have happened. Why would there be visible phenomena outside the warp drive? Prepare for disconnect. Are you done? Yeah. Mom? Clear all moorings. Aft thrusters. Aft thrusters, aye. Impulse power to the helm. Dalen? Dalen, it's Beverly. Computer, current location of Dr Dalen Quaice. There is no Dr Dalen Quaice aboard the Enterprise. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Come. Lt Worf, yesterday, before we left starbase, an old friend of mine came on board, Dr Dalen Quaice. I requested quarters for him. He was assigned here. I was not aware of this passenger. I thought it was standard procedure for you to be informed. It is. Please proceed. We were to meet for breakfast. But I can't seem to find him or his belongings. Computer, where is Dr Dalen Quaice? There is no Dr Dalen Quaice aboard the Enterprise. Dr Quaice is very old and rather frail. If he fell, if his communicator were damaged... I will order a search immediately. Thank you. Even if Dr Quaice had been injured, why would his belongings be missing? I have teams conducting a deck-by-deck search. It is not yet complete. I scanned the entire ship. Other than the regular complement, I found no one else on board. Your sensors wouldn't detect him if he were dead. That is correct, Doctor. Could he have returned to the starbase without telling you? An emergency? There were a lot of people going back and forth yesterday. We could check the transporter ID traces. By all means check the trace log, but even if the results are negative, contact Starbase Command. Aye, sir. One moment, Doctor. I'm sure you're aware of the procedure involving passengers. Of course. I don't know why Lt Worf wasn't told about Dr Quaice. I was not informed either. But I sent in a request weeks ago. Then it was intercepted before it reached me. And someone else sent approval? Why? Dr Quaice had been stationed at the starbase for some time? Six years. It would be prudent to find out if he had any enemies there. Course laid in for Durenia IV. Thank you. Mr. Data? Starbase 133 has no record of a Dr Dalen Quaice. You said he was there for six years. Not according to their computer. I accessed Starfleet records. There is no Dr Quaice currently serving. I can find no service record or birth records with that name. I can find no... Data! I interned with him on Delos IV. I've known him for 15 years. I do not doubt you. But I have tried 173 phonetic variations of the name and... His name is Dalen Quaice. Q-U-A-l-C-E. Whatever your records say, they're wrong. Mr. Worf? We have completed our search. We cannot locate Dr Quaice. You're not alone. He was on board. I met him myself in transporter room three. For reasons unknown, someone has taken great pains to erase all traces of him. Who was on transporter duty? Was he part of the regular crew? No, he's a friend of Dr Crusher's. When did he arrive? Yesterday at 1600 hours. That was my watch. I beamed this man on board? Yes, I met him. An elderly man, not in the best of health. I'm sorry. I remember you being here for a while. But you were alone. Was he invisible? Did I have a conversation with thin air? No, Doctor. As I recall, you came in and looked around for a few moments. I asked you if I could help you. All you said was, ""Thank you."" I said, ""My pleasure,"" and that was the end of it. There was no one else here. I can't believe that Chief O'Brien might be lying. He believes what he says. And there is no trace imprint for Dr Quaice. I didn't just conjure up one of my best friends from a test tube. If the ship's records were tampered with, the transporter's could have been. With everybody coming and going, maybe O'Brien doesn't remember. Or... Or? We could run a diagnostic on him. Make sure he wasn't tampered with? What do you think? It's worth a try. I'll check the replicator-activity logs. 18 hours is a long time to go without food. Or without someone seeing him. This examination will only take a few minutes. But I feel fine. Sit down. It's no use checking my eyesight. I didn't see your friend. I'll be a little more comprehensive than that, Chief. Dr Crusher to Dr Hill. Respond, please. Dr Selar, your present location? Computer, current whereabouts of Doctors Hill and Selar? There is no Dr Hill or Dr Selar aboard the Enterprise. Doctors Hill and Selar and four other members of my staff have vanished. All record of their being on board has been excised from the computer. Did they come with Dr Quaice? No. They've been on board for months. But my two duty nurses don't remember them. Nor do their families. As O'Brien didn't remember Dr Quaice. I checked O'Brien. I found no physiological abnormalities. Crusher to Capt Picard. Go ahead. I'm in Engineering, sir. There's something that may be connected to Quaice's disappearance. On my way. Progress? No one's seen him. His replicator has not been used. Check hull and shield integrity for intruders. Yes, sir. But I've been monitoring all on-board sensors. There has been no indication... Do a level-one diagnostic. Run a manual sweep of anomalous airborne or electromagnetic readings. I want some answers. I've used Kosinski's warp equations to try to improve engine efficiency. I've read your reports. We did a test run at the starbase. Here's what the computer recorded. This is the static warp field we created. The experiment aimed to keep a bubble intact. As you'll see, we couldn't. There was a momentary flash of light. It was all over the spectrum. I remember that. A bubble could have made Dr Quaice disappear? If he were caught in it, yes. It'd seem to us like he disappeared. Where would he go? He could be outside our space-time continuum. Was he here during your experiment? No, sir. The bubble didn't expand beyond Engineering? No, sir. Then how could it trap Dr Quaice or the others? There are others missing? Yes. And they were nowhere near Engineering. It doesn't make sense. I doubt that a warp bubble could alter computer records or erase memories. Keep at it. It's our only working theory for now. Something else happened? Sickbay is empty. I have no staff. And that surprises you? I'll say it surprises me! There should be at least four members on duty. Ship's records do not concur. What are you talking about? You do not have a staff. I'm the sole medical officer on a ship with over 1,000 people on board? Excuse me, Doctor, but the entire ship's complement is 230. What?! Doctor, may I see you in my ready room? Would you care for something? So, Beverly... Tea, Earl Grey, hot. You're saying that this ship has lost nearly 800 of its personnel? I know how it sounds. None of the scans show any anomalies. No signs of an intruder. Wesley's experiment did not have the scope to affect an entire ship. Captain, the Enterprise is in serious danger. You must believe me. I have no choice but to believe you. The safety of my entire crew is at stake, but... I must be sure... That I haven't lost my mind? I just examined myself. Being the only doctor on board, I had to do it myself. There was no dysfunction. Increased adrenaline elevation, but that is understandable. Did you find anything that suggests why you're the only one among us unaffected by this... this phenomenon? No. I'll talk to Troi. Wouldn't do any harm. Captain, please! Return this ship to Starbase 133 for a full diagnostic. I realize you have my word only to convince you. Mr. Riker? Captain? Set a course to return to Starbase 133 immediately. Aye, sir. Your word has always been good enough for me. I've had a team in sickbay for two hours. We've scanned the EM spectrum in case there was a wave guide leaking radiation. We've crawled around the ductwork. I don't know what this vortex was that Dr Crusher saw. I didn't just see it. I felt it. I barely escaped from it! There's nothing there now. And no sign there ever was. Is there any possible connection with Mr. Crusher's experiment? Could this warp bubble be floating about the ship? No, sir. It was contained in Engineering. It couldn't affect anything on deck 12. I completed computer diagnostics. There are no malfunctions. Any ships respond to our queries? The Wellington is the only vessel nearby. It reports normal operations. A Ferengi ship also reports nothing unusual. Are all the members of the crew accounted for? Yes, Doctor. How many are there? There are 114 people on the Enterprise. What?! That is the number there should be. There are now over 900 missing. Deck after deck of this ship is deserted! Why are there empty rooms? If there are only meant to be 114 people, why all the extra space? Transportation of colonists, diplomatic missions, evacuations. Thank you. Confine nonessential personnel to quarters. Computer, go to red alert. I'd like Lt Worf to program sensors to monitor all personnel. I'm sorry. Whom did you say? Worf. Chief of Security. The big guy who never smiles? The Klingon! Deanna. I need you to tell me if I've gone completely mad. If you can ask the question, I'd say no. Don't evade the question. Then ask me one I can answer. I've delivered babies that no longer exist. No one else remembers them. Yet I can close my eyes and see their faces clearly as I see yours. What if it's not some conspiracy? What if it is just me? What if it is just you? I've delayed a mission and frightened people, including myself. So what? You have acted in the best interest of your ship and crew. What more could you ask? And if this turns out to be a mistake, then we'll be late arriving at Durenia IV. That's all. It's not a mistake. I wish it were. When we reach starbase, I'll order a complete work-up. If we reach starbase. Wesley. Where's Wesley? Wesley? Mom? Are you alright? No. We may have very little time left. You don't believe me. Mom, I don't know... I don't have time to convince you. Hundreds are missing. Your experiment is the only explanation we have. There it is. I don't know what else to do with it. Find someone who does, who knows about warp bubbles. Kosinski can't explain it either, and this is based on his equations. There is someone who may be able to help, but I can't reach him. Who? Kosinski's assistant. An alien from Tau Alpha C. Some kind of Traveller. He combined warp technology and the energy from his thoughts. Yes, I remember. Wesley, do you think it's possible that you've accidentally recreated something that he did that could alter reality? I don't see how. He's the only one who could explain it. I sent a message to Tau Alpha C, but it could take days to get there. Maybe the Captain can help. We've got to find him. If he's still alive. He was very sick. We can't stand here doing nothing. It's a chance. We have to try to... Wesley! Wesley? They're all gone? Riker? Troi? Data? Wait a minute. Let me guess. You never heard of any of them. I have been more than fair. I've done everything I can to substantiate your... Your perceptions of a... Will Riker! Your First Officer. He's very good at playing poker, he loves to cook, he listens to jazz music, plays the trombone. I cannot find any evidence of a Riker! Cmdr Data, the android who sits at Ops, dreams of being human, never gets the punch-line of a joke. Doctor, we'll be arriving at Starbase 133 in a few hours. Deanna Troi, Counsellor, half-Betazoid, loves chocolate. Her mother makes you shudder. O'Brien, Geordi, Worf, Wesley, my son. They all have been the living, breathing heart of this crew for over three years. They deserve more than to be shrugged off, brushed aside, just pinched out of existence like that. They all do. They deserve so much more. Beverly, perhaps it would be best if you confined yourself to sickbay until we arrive. It's all perfectly logical to you, isn't it? The two of us roaming the galaxy in the Federation flagship. No crew at all. We've never needed a crew before. I don't suppose you remember an alien from Tau Alpha C who was on board once? He called himself a Traveller. I don't know how, but we have got to find this Traveller, or another from his race. If anyone can help us... I give you my word. When we arrive at the starbase, I will make every effort to find him. It's not a delusion. It is not a dream. There is a physical, measurable phenomenon at work here. Perhaps you could help me to identify it. How? I'd like to use the computer to monitor your life functions. Until I disappear? It will happen. Alright. Computer, continuous scan, Capt Picard, vital signs. Audible readout. Begin now. Temperature, 37.2 degrees... I'll do what I can to find out what's happening and bring you all back. Blood pressure, 122/70... I'm sorry I lost my temper. You do remember that? Vividly. But if I have forgotten my closest friends and comrades, as you say, then I deserved every word. For some time, I've been meaning to say something to you. I might not have another chance. Jean-Luc, you and l... I won't forget. I won't forget any of you. Wesley, have you got it? What's happening? I'm losing it! The link isn't holding, Commander! I'll go to the secondary equations. No. Look. I've lost it. Damn, I'm sorry, Wesley. It's over. There's no way we'll get her back now. It's not over, Wesley. There's still a way. Captain's log, star date 44162.5. Two attempts to retrieve Dr Crusher have failed. And now, the Traveller, a mysterious visitor from our past, has reappeared. Is she alive? As long as she thinks she is alive, she is alive. What the hell does that mean? Your species have very narrow perceptions of time and space and thought. When Beverly Crusher was caught in the static warp bubble, she created her own reality. Her thoughts at the precise moment she was trapped determined its shape and form. Can you go in and get her back? No. It is her reality. I cannot enter it any more than I can enter her thoughts. But you said there's still a way. I can help. But I can't do it myself. Wesley, there is a power within each of us that most people haven't begun to realize. But you have begun. Or else I would not have known to come here. Together, we may be able to open a gateway for her. But she must choose to walk through it. Computer, we are going to apply precise diagnostic methodology. Once we've catalogued the symptoms, we will proceed to determine the illness and then find the cure. We will start with the assumption that I am not crazy. If I am, it won't matter one way or another. Read the entire crew roster for the Enterprise. Dr Beverly Crusher. Have I always been the only member of the crew on the Enterprise? Affirmative. If this were a bad dream, would you tell me? That is not a valid question. Like hell it's not! What date did I report on board? Star date 41154, 1400 hours, three minutes. Sounds about right. Is there more than one USS Enterprise? This vessel is the fifth starship to bear the name USS Enterprise. It is currently the only one in service. What is the primary mission of the Starship Enterprise? To explore the galaxy. Do I have the skills to complete that mission alone? Negative. Then why am I the only crew member? A-ha. Got you there. That information is not available. Are you familiar with the inhabitants of Tau Alpha C? Affirmative. Are any located on any starbase or vessel within communication distance? Negative. Estimated time to Tau Alpha C at warp 9.5? 123 days. Lay in a new course for Tau Alpha C, and send a subspace message advising them of our arrival. Acknowledged. Engage. Computer, did you change course? State new destination or coordinates. I stated it, damn it! Tau Alpha C. There is no Tau Alpha C listed on current star maps. Captain's log, star date 44162. 8. At the direction of the Traveller, the Enterprise is returning to Starbase 133 and the precise position where the subspace bubble was formed. Our goal will be to create a stable gateway between our reality and your mother's reality. We tried. We can't stabilize the link. Of course not. The equations are only the first step. We will be going beyond mathematics. Tell me what I have to do. Begin by letting go of your guilt. But I shouldn't have tried... Focus on the present. You'll have to be here completely to help her back. You must open yourself to time and space, and the intricate threads that bind them. Begin entering your warp-field equations. Now close your eyes. See past the numbers. Trust yourself. I can't. I can't do it. When the time comes, you will, Wesley. You will. Starbase 133, this is the Enterprise. Starbase 133, this is the Enterprise. Please acknowledge. Viewscreen on. It's not just people. Everything is disappearing! Computer, what is that mist I'm seeing? Sensors indicate it is a mass-energy field 705 metres in diameter. It surrounds the ship? Affirmative. If there's nothing wrong with me,... ..maybe there's something wrong with the universe. Computer, what is beyond the mass energy field? Sensors cannot penetrate the field. Here's a question you shouldn't be able to answer. Computer, what is the nature of the universe? The universe is a spheroid region 705 metres in diameter. Captain, approaching Starbase 133. Slow to ten metres per second. Prepare for precision station keeping. Acknowledged. Readying thrusters. There. There it is. We're moving into phase now. There's your warp bubble, Wesley. What? What's wrong? It is... collapsing. Computer, give me a graphic representation of the universe. I've seen this before. Wesley's experiment! The bubble. Of course! But that would mean that I'm the one trapped in the bubble. What's happening? Explosive decompression, decks five through fourteen. Sealing off forward sections. Cause? A flaw in the ship's design. Show me. Analysis. No ship's structures exist forward of bulkhead 342. Superimpose previous image over this one, same scale and continue to monitor. It's collapsing! Hull integrity now compromised on decks three through fifteen. Computer, how long can life support be maintained? Four minutes, 17 seconds. We have re-established exact coordinates and attitude. Geordi, we're in position. Status? Warp bubble is contracting at a rate of 15 metres per second. We'll lose it in four minutes. It is time, Wesley. We're ready. Proceed. I'll be in Engineering. Let it go, Wesley. Let go of the anticipation, the expectations, the demands upon yourself. Let it all go. Leave it behind. Yes. The ability is there, inside of you. You do not need to look for it. Three minutes, 30 seconds to life-support failure. The Traveller used his thoughts to alter warp fields. Thoughts became reality. Now I'm in a warp field. Could my thoughts have changed this reality? Come on, Beverly! What's the next step? What was I thinking at the moment Wesley's bubble formed? Dalen Quaice. He said all the people he'd known were gone. I thought of Jack, I went to see Wesley, the flash in Engineering... That's when it started! That's when I started losing everybody. My thoughts created this universe. Can they get me out of it again? That information is not available. I'm not talking to you. Click my heels together three times, and I'm back in Kansas. Can it be that simple? Two minutes, 30 seconds to life-support failure. Hypothetical situation. A person is trapped inside a static warp bubble. Determine a means of escape. Establish a stable threshold between the warp field and the outer environment. Describe this threshold. There are no known practical applications of this theory. Extrapolate. How would it manifest itself? A dynamic atmospheric disturbance of great intensity. Disturbance? The vortex. They must have been trying to reach me! But how do I find it? Wesley, where do I go? Help me. Stable threshold. They've been trying to create a stable threshold. Where are they trying to do it? Where did they do it the first time? Engineering! One minute, 30 seconds to life-support failure. Engineering. Failure in turbo shaft four. Unable to proceed to Engineering. Take me anywhere on deck 36. We're losing the bubble! Beverly. Jean-Luc. You. Do I have you to thank for getting me back? No. Jean-Luc, if I might ask, how many people are there on board? 1,014, including your guest, Dr Quaice. Something wrong with that? No. That's the exact number there should be. "
S4E06,"One. Trying for another inside straight? Don't say I didn't warn you. I fold. I will raise you... three. No cards? The best poker face I've ever seen. Dealer takes two. Your three, and... ten more. I will see your ten and raise you 20. Have you got a flush or a full house? It will cost you 20 to make that determination, sir. Dealer folds. You two have successfully divided the evening between you. I suspect conspiracy. Far be it from me to accuse my superior officers. You're getting harder to bluff. You've learned this game well. Yes, sir, I believe I have. I'll bet that I can find any card you hide in this deck. Furthermore, I will make you help me find it. Careful, Data. Your guidance is much valued, Counsellor. However... Pick a card. Don't let me see it. Now lose it in the deck. Cut the deck into two even piles. OK. One more time. And again. How many cards? Eleven. Take five. Throw them away. Pick three more. OK. Now pick one of those. Is that your card? Incredible. Not at all, Counsellor. You surreptitiously put the edge of your thumb against the card. When you reshuffled, you kept that card on top. You thus were able to have me either save or discard depending on the location of the card, which you followed until we were left with just one: the card I originally chose. Sir. I believe, under the circumstances... Picard to Riker. Captain. We've received a distress call. We're changing course to intercept. Captain's log, star date 44215.2. The Enterprise has bypassed its archaeological survey to answer a distress call from the Federation freighter Arcos, which is in emergency orbit around Turkana IV, birthplace of our late comrade, Tasha Yar. We'll be entering the Turkana system in 11 minutes. Engine status? Stable. But we have been at warp factor nine for longer than recommended. Message from the Arcos. The transmitter is failing. Audio only. Let's hear it. This is Tan Tsu, Arcos Engineer. Estimate five minutes to warp-drive containment breach! Make that three minutes. Thanks for trying, Enterprise. Ensign, warp factor 9.3. How much time? Seven minutes 15 seconds puts us within transporter range. 9.6. Prepare to lock on to the crewmen. Aye, Captain. We are now entering the Turkana system, sir. Slow to impulse. Visual contact, sir. Get them out of there, O'Brien. Status, O'Brien? There's nothing to lock on to. I read an ion trail characteristic of a freighter escape pod. Unable to establish contact. Could have been damaged by the blast. Maybe they maintained orbit. Let's hope they stay clear of the colony. That is where the ion trail leads. Hail the colony. I've been trying to. No response. Communication has been unreliable since their government fell apart. The last Federation vessel to make contact, six years ago, was warned that anyone transporting down to the colony would be killed. Number One, ready an away team. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, supplemental. We are orbiting Turkana IV, an Earth colony that severed from the Federation 15 years ago. I am concerned for the away team, but if we are to discover the fate of the two crewmen, I see no alternative. The surface settlement is all but destroyed. The colonists live in structures that extend 3 km beneath the city. What's the pod's landing point? 300 metres beyond the perimeter. Sir, we can anticipate a violent response to our presence. Perhaps the doctor should wait here. Though appreciated, your concern is exaggerated. The colony is completely lawless. Lt Yar spoke of rape gangs... Mr. Worf, I can handle myself. She's coming. The Arcos crewmen may need medical attention. Set phasers on maximum stun. Energize. The trail continues this way. The concentration gradient increases along this vector. The escape pod was apparently moved into the tunnels ahead of us. Hardly the response we expected. Pardon me. Maybe things have changed here. Open phaser. Identify yourselves! We're from a Federation starship. We tracked two crewmen here. Do you know about them? Possibly. What do you mean? They found us. Proximity detectors. Follow me! The Alliance is holding your men hostage, not us. You can expect a ransom demand. The Alliance? Our good friends... will be upset when they realize we took their last crate of synth-ale. Maybe I should try the authorities. We are the authorities. The Coalition, our cadre, runs this side of the city. The Alliance runs the other side. Take your pick. Are you offering to help us? In return for some... consideration. Phasers are in short supply here. A starship isn't going to miss a few. That is no better than a ransom demand. The Alliance will eventually kill your crewmen anyway. With our help, at least you might get them back alive. I'm asking for help with defence. We are trying to keep the peace. All we've seen indicates otherwise. A prank! Our proximity implants stop us from doing serious damage. They warn us of the enemy's approach. Then why do you need more phasers? The Alliance just found a cache of weapons. I'm... just trying to make things even, to preserve the peace. You keep using the word peace. We've heard another version of life here. Ancient history. Where did you hear that? A former crewman was born here. Where is he now? She was killed in the line of duty. As good a way to die as any. As I said, ancient history. This is now and your men are in trouble. We'll return to the ship and consider your proposal. A gift for your captain. Riker to Enterprise. Energize. I want everything there is to know about the Starship Enterprise. Hayne says they raid each other for supplies, mostly non-essential. Why? A battle exercise. Their defences prevent deep strikes. Minor skirmishes are all that's left. Coalition. Alliance. It sounds so reasonable, but this is the behaviour of urban street thugs. We won't trade weapons for crewmen. How do you suggest we deal with them? We have to tell them something. No promises, no denials. For now, Hayne's Coalition is our only safe access. We'll keep the door open and see. Captain. Transmission coming in from Turkana IV, on a secure channel. On screen. Hello, Enterprise. Cmdr Riker, would you introduce me to your captain? I'm Capt Jean-Luc Picard. I have someone here you might like to meet. This is Ishara. Ishara Yar. Tasha was my sister. There's an old saying, Captain: the enemy of my enemy is my friend. It's in my best interests to help you get your crewmen back. With nothing from us in return? You could be forced to pay my adversary a ransom in weapons. I'll do anything I can to avoid that possibility. What do you propose? Ishara will be our liaison. I know Alliance territory. I can help you with the rescue plan. One moment. Mute. Reactions? I do not trust him. She could be a fake. He knows a crew member was from the colony. So Hayne searched their database on Starfleet for Tasha's name. Counsellor? He's deceiving us and he's clearly hoping to manipulate us. As for the identity of the young woman, I can't really tell. It's still an option we cannot neglect. We'll continue on other fronts as they present themselves. For now, let's hear her. Open. I will accept your proposal. Thank you. Good luck. Welcome to the Enterprise, Ishara. I am Cmdr Data. You're not human. I am an android. Built for fighting? Why do you assume that? A cybernetic device on a starship... The Enterprise is a ship of exploration. First, I'll help you map the colony. This is a grid of the tunnels. I can fill in the details from memory. I will take you to the observation lounge. Please come with me. Your sister never spoke of you. It's not surprising. It is surprising to me. Tasha and I spent much time together. We had a number of conversations. Did she talk about the colony? Only to say she was lucky to escape. It wasn't luck, it was cowardice. Cowardice is a term I have never heard applied to Tasha. Is something wrong? No. It is just that, for a moment, the expression on your face reminded me of her. It's been 15 years. I don't even remember what she looked like. You don't believe I'm Tasha's sister. We have considered the possibility. I'm not surprised. You can sample my DNA if you'd like. Yes. I will. Please, sit down. Thank you. Perhaps you could give us an idea of what we're dealing with. The last information describes a colony in complete disarray. It started falling apart 30 years ago. There were dozens of factions. They fought until the city above ground was in ruins. You and the Alliance are left? We were the two strongest factions. The government couldn't keep order, so they gave us police powers. They designed the proximity detectors to keep us under control. Apparently that didn't work very well. No. After a few months, we didn't need the government any more. Tasha left you in amongst that? She didn't abandon me. Tasha asked me to go with her, but I had already joined the Coalition. They were my family. We don't have much time. Maybe we should start. Transmission from the colony. On screen. Enterprise, I'm being held by Turkana IV Alliance. I've been told to say you have 20 hours to make reparations for Federation intrusions into this colony, or my pilot and I will be killed. Can we at least send some medical... Take that seriously. They'll torture and kill them. My cadre has never recovered a hostage alive from the Alliance. Your crewmen could be held in any number of places. The Alliance has two main headquarters and 13 ancillary bases, all underground, all heavily guarded. If I find the myographic scanner... What's that? A sensing device from the escape pod. It monitors the bioelectric signatures of the crew if they get separated from the pod. I could install a booster on it that would relay its signals to us. Then we could track them from up here. Unfortunately we don't know where the escape pod is. Level 3C, section 547. We have our sources. Access tunnels are here and here. We could get the away team right into the centre. Don't underestimate them. They'll be ready for that. I've seen them use this strategy before. It looks isolated and accessible, but my guess is they have hundreds above and below just waiting for you. We will need a diversion. Transport photon grenades to the next chamber. It wouldn't kill anybody, but it would shake them up a bit. That won't give you enough time to install the relay. Transport me into this corridor. My implant will set off alarms. They'll think it's a Coalition raid. Too dangerous. In those tunnels you could easily be cut off. Worf... Commander! I was ordered to assist you in any way possible. That doesn't mean as long as it's safe or convenient. You don't have the time to make another plan. I'm your best option. She would have to be armed, sir. I'll discuss this with the Captain. Take Ishara down to see Dr Crusher. You have Tasha's DNA on file? The ship's computer does. The small difference between sonomic chromosomes doesn't affect results. It should take me a few hours to run the sonomic comparison. That wasn't too bad. So all that's left of my sister is a file in a computer. Tasha exists in our memories as well. How did she die? Lt Yar was killed on Vagra II by a malevolent entity. In battle? No. She was killed as proof of the creature's power, without provocation. That's not how I intend to die. The Captain approves. You're with us. Enterprise, we're in position. Mr. O'Brien, energize. Aye, Captain. They're at level two. Tunnel 16. Come on. You're with us. Spread out. Let's check five. Yes, sir. Check on three. Checking. Somebody's here. Watch your backs. I'm right behind you. Damn! What is taking so long? It's badly damaged. It scans, but the power source keeps fluctuating. Can you fix it? With a shunt from the converter. How soon? Ten minutes? Do it. O'Brien, get Ishara out of here. There's a transformer substation above the chamber she's in. It's masking her signal. Stand by. Stay and cover La Forge. Commander... ! That's an order. Then return to the ship. I'll signal for transport. Get us out of here! Energizing. Come. How is she? A few cracked ribs. She'll be OK. Dr Crusher just called me with the DNA results. Ishara is Tasha's sister. After what she did for us, that doesn't surprise me one bit. You took some unnecessary personal risks, Number One. We lost Tasha on an away team under my command. The thought of that happening to her sister... We can't afford emotional responses. Understood. Commander... Well done. I've fused the bone tissue along both fractures. The muscles will be weak for a day or two, but you shouldn't feel pain. Thank you, Doctor. I wanted to thank you personally for what you did for us on the colony. It was more than I expected. I don't run away when things get tough, like some people. Like my sister did. Let me tell you about your sister. The first time I saw Tasha Yar, she was picking through a minefield to reach a wounded colonist. Her ship had responded to their distress call, as had mine. When it was all over, I requested her transfer to the Enterprise. Her ship's captain owed me a favour. In the following months, she always put the crew's safety before her own, and she died doing the same. I'm sorry you never knew the woman Tasha became. I think you would have been proud of her. And she of you. What is this structure? A main fusion source. Each Alliance headquarters has one to power its defensive systems. This chamber is accessed from below. Entry points are spaced along this wall every 25 metres. Data, where was Tasha's post? Tactical station. Where Lt Worf is now. Did Tasha have many friends here? Yes. She was especially close to Cmdr Riker and Lt Worf. And to myself. Are you able to have friends? Yes. But you don't have feelings. Not as such. But even among humans, friendship is sometimes less an emotional response and more a sense of familiarity. So you can become used to someone? Exactly. As I receive sensory inputs, my mental pathways attune to them. The input is eventually anticipated, and even missed when absent. Like my sister. Yes, like your sister. They're so far underground it's hard to pinpoint their signatures. But the men are here, next to one of the headquarters. That's 2 km of granite above their heads. So much for the transporters. We could use the ship's phasers to cut through to this storage tunnel. With a clear path, we could transport through the tunnel and get the men. But I'll need two hours to refit our phasers for drilling. It's a real maze down there. I spent a lot of time in that section before they took it over. There are dead ends that don't even show up on this map. We do not have much choice. If it wasn't for my implant setting off the alarms, I could guide you. We could remove the implant. It has a micro-explosive inside that detonates on contact with air. When you join a cadre, you join for life. A force field containing inert gas could be put over the incision site. The explosive could be disarmed at the same time it is removed. You'll have to decide for yourself. Think about it while we wait for Geordi. My parents were killed in some crossfire just after I was born. Some people took care of us for a few months, but then... one day we came home and they were gone. Tasha took care of me, and when I was old enough I joined the Coalition. Tasha did not? My sister hated the cadres. She blamed them for our parents' death. For everything. She refused to join, and she left as soon as she had the chance. I always thought she was weak for doing that. But... maybe I was wrong. Maybe... she made the right choice. To work together for something besides killing,... ..to be close to someone without always having to protect your back... Very appealing. You're the perfect example. I hardly know you but I completely trust you. I... I even consider you a friend. Thank you. I would like to consider you my friend as well. If I had known about this place 15 years ago,... ..things might have been different. Maybe it's not too late. Ishara is willing to have the implant removed, sir. Good. Inform Dr Crusher. She has also expressed a desire to leave the colony. She hopes to apply to the Academy and eventually join Starfleet. Does she understand the magnitude of these decisions? She claims to, Captain. I get ambiguity from her. Her loyalties are clearly divided. So we should deny her an escape from this environment? No. I'm just not sure she wants to escape. It's all she's ever known. Ultimately, it is her decision to make, not ours. Mr. Data, proceed with the mission as planned. Data... Yes, Counsellor? You seem so strong in your support. I'm curious. We must free the crewmen. She is our best hope of doing so. In addition... I have become used to her. Ishara. Thank you, Data. You are welcome. Dr Crusher is expecting you in sickbay. It's all so different. To what are you referring? At home nobody does anything for anyone else unless they have something to gain from it. But I do have something to gain: your continued presence on the ship. Is something wrong? I have to tell Hayne and the others. I owe it to them. Guess I ought to get it over with. If you desire privacy, use the observation lounge. That would probably make things a little easier. Report. It's working. Captain's log, star date 44225.3. Dr Crusher has successfully removed Ishara's implant, enabling the young woman to guide our rescue attempt. Without my intending it, she is now an active member of the crew. Cardiovascular functions normal. Metabolism, immunity, all of the vital signs excellent. How do you feel? Better than I've ever felt. Thanks for staying with me. You might want to keep this. It's been with you a long time. You keep it, Data. So you won't forget me. Did you reconsider your decision to stay? No. Just in case something goes wrong down there. I understand you wish to join Starfleet. Some day. If I'm lucky. On that day it is we who will be lucky. Is your team ready? Waiting for your signal. Status, Mr. La Forge? Phasers ready to fire. How far in must we go? 1.6 km. Fire phasers. Aye, sir. 1.3 kilometres. 1.4. 1.5. 1.6 kilometres. Deep enough for transport. Cease fire. Mr. O'Brien, energize. This way. Caution is indicated. We're near their heart. Security is minimal. They aren't expecting anybody this far in. Ishara... Follow me. Are you certain? No, I'm not. I'm trying to remember. I was here, but it was a long time ago. There have been changes. It's through here. There. Your men are behind that door. Hold out your hands. Let's move. Where is she? Commander! Look. What happened here? She probably tried to draw their fire. It set off the alarm. Get these men to the Enterprise. Come on! Data, you're with me. Ishara. What are you doing? The fusion generator is overloading. You are attempting to disable the defence system. For what reason? We have rescued the crewmen. I don't care about your crewmen. We have 3,000 troops waiting at the perimeter. When the defences go down, they'll come in. The Alliance will fall. The Federation will be responsible for the deaths. I cannot allow that. You don't have a choice. That is not so. I don't want to kill you, Data. But I will. The explosion will destroy us both. The Coalition's been all I've had for 15 years. They've given me a life. I don't mind dying for them. But you won't have to if you just get out of here now! Was this your intention from the beginning? We'd never have gotten this far without your help. Our help was not deliberate. You deceived us. You got what you came for! Why do you care about what we do? Your friendship with me was part of the deception, was it not? You misled me at each step, and yet I was completely unaware. It doesn't matter now. None of it does. Now get of here, Data, please! Now! My duty requires me to intercede. Ishara! What was she doing? Disabling the detectors so her forces could attack. Set to kill. Your strategy failed. It was a calculated risk. You gave us an opportunity we couldn't ignore. Ishara, are you hurt? No. I want her returned immediately. You're in no position to dictate to us. She attacked two of our officers. You have no jurisdiction here. Jurisdiction! Yours is based entirely on the threat of violence. You have your crewmen back. Isn't that enough? What do you know about... Cmdr Data, escort Ishara to the transporter room. Thank you. Close the channel! I'm just trying to preserve the pea... You're far more charitable than I would have been, Captain. I understand your feelings, Number One. I share them. Perhaps the fault lies in ourselves. We were so eager to accept her. Each of us, myself included, wanted to see something of Tasha in this woman. We saw more than was there. You haven't said one word to me. What do you wish to talk about? I did what I had to do. I'm sorry if I hurt you in the process. I am an android. It is not possible for me to be injured in that fashion. Whenever you're ready. You know, I wasn't always lying to you. That time we spent talking... That was the closest thing to friendship I've ever had. If that means anything to you. Energize. Come in. Data, what's on your mind? Recent events have left me puzzled, sir. It has been days since Ishara left, yet my thoughts seem to dwell on her. As if I were experiencing a feedback loop in my mnemonic network. I know what you mean. It is curious that I was so easily misled. Make that ""we"". Yes, sir. Sit down. Thank you, sir. In all trust, there is the possibility of betrayal. I'm not sure you were... prepared for that. Were you prepared, sir? I don't think anybody ever is. Then it is better not to trust. Without trust there's no friendship, no closeness... None of the bonds that make us who we are. And yet you put yourself at risk. Every single time. Perhaps I am fortunate, sir, to be spared the emotional consequences. Perhaps. "
S4E07,"Captain's log, star date 44246.3. We're investigating radiation anomalies reported in the Gamma Arigulon system by the Starship LaSalle. Preliminary readings are inconclusive. Mr. Data? No changes, Commander. I can detect no abnormalities in the star's energy. Prepare two class-one probes. Probes ready, Captain. Initiate launch sequence. Captain, Klingon attack cruiser decloaking. Bearing 010.237. Belay that order, Mr. Data. Did Starfleet mention any Klingon ships in this sector? On screen. We are being hailed. All stop. Aye, sir, all stop. Open a channel. Hello, Capt Picard. Ambassador K'Ehleyr. This is an unexpected pleasure. It's good to see you again, Captain. Lt Worf. How may we be of assistance? There's an urgent matter to discuss. Permission to come aboard? Granted. Lieutenant, please receive our guest. Captain,... I must request permission to send another officer. May I know your reason? My... dishonour among Klingons may offend Ambassador K'Ehleyr. Lieutenant, you are a member of this crew, and you will not go into hiding whenever a Klingon vessel uncloaks. I withdraw my request, sir. I've just received coordinates. Ready to transport two. Two? Yes, sir. Energize. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. I hope he'll be alright. Alexander hasn't had much contact with other children. Not even a bite on the cheek for old times' sake? Perhaps you're not aware of my dishonour. I have accepted... discommendation. I've heard. So now what? I have to perform a ridiculous ritual to talk to you? You may not respect our traditions,... but I do. Sorry. I just thought you might want to talk. A few minutes ago, you looked like someone with a question to ask. Must I ask the question? Yes, you must. What should I tell Alexander? That he has no father? The Klingon Empire is at a critical juncture. We may face civil war. War over what? The usual excuses. Tradition, duty,... honour. The word ""excuses"" implies ulterior motives for a conflict. I won't bore you with the intricacies of Klingon politics. Basically, two factions are trying to seize power. Do you believe there is a threat to the Federation? Klingon wars seldom remain confined to the Empire. They'll drag in neighbouring star systems, the Tholians, the Ferengi. The Federation won't be able to stay out of it for long. This has been coming. Only K'mpec, the Head of the Council, has been able to maintain the peace. Now something has changed that? Correct. K'mpec is dying. He is aboard the cruiser. He has come specifically to meet with you, Captain. Alone. It's about time you arrived, Picard. Sit. I need your help. If our medical facility can do anything to help... Too late. For some months I have been poisoned with small doses of Veridium Six. The wine. There is no cure. What do you want of me? After I die, you will act in my name to arbitrate the struggle for power. I will? No one on the Council can be trusted. And... I have my reasons for wanting... an outsider. K'mpec, you cannot possibly be serious? A Federation officer has no business... Nonsense. You are an accomplished mediator. This is no different than any other dispute requiring your services. On the contrary, I think this is very different. And I must, respectfully,... decline. If you refuse... the dying request of the Klingon Supreme Commander, it will be an insult by the Federation to all Klingons. Besides, I've already sent the order. The leaders of the opposing two factions are on their way. You had no right to involve me without my permission. If I'd asked,... ..you would have said no. This is not just a case of simple mediation. You are asking me to choose the next leader of the Klingon Empire. No. By tradition, the two strongest challengers fight for the Rite of Succession. As mediator, only you can designate those challengers. But you said only two challengers are arriving. What is the point? I want you to discover which one of them has killed me. Gowron... or Duras. Yes. Duras. I thought you would find that interesting. Interesting? You could say that, since he tried to have me killed,... ..and conspired to strip Worf of his good name. And... I approved. All for the glory of the Empire. That should be my epitaph. Find the assassin. A Klingon who kills without showing his face has no honour. He must not lead the Empire. Such a man would be capable of anything. Even war with the Federation. Very well. I accept. Captain's log, supplemental. K'mpec, who ruled for longer than any Klingon leader, is dead. We await Duras and Gowron, rivals for the leadership of the High Council. There is no honour in attacking the weak. I would have won. No. You must earn victory. Where are the other Klingons? There are no others on board. Why? The Federation and the Empire were enemies for years. No other Klingons have asked to serve in Starfleet. Why? A warrior does not ask so many questions. I don't want to be a warrior. Hello! Well, you're back early. He made me leave. Maybe you should go to your room and play. Is he under arrest? He knows nothing of our ways! Our ways? You mean Klingon ways, don't you? He is Klingon! He is my son and I am half-human. He will find his own ways. Why the sudden concern? You won't even acknowledge he's yours. Why did you not tell me? And what would you have done? Right, you would have insisted that we take the oath, just as tradition would demand. You should not have kept this from me. Well,... now you know. I cannot acknowledge my relationship to the boy. It would only harm him. Because you were dishonoured? As my son, he would also bear my disgrace. As would his children. But why did you accept discommendation from the Council? My father was accused of collaborating with the Romulans at Khitomer. I know, and you challenged it. Yes, at first. Ultimately, I withdrew my challenge. Why, Worf? I can't believe you'd just give up. What really happened? Lt Worf, Ambassador K'Ehleyr, report to the bridge. On our way, Commander. Klingon vessels Vorn and Buruk holding stations at 13 kms, sir. Open a channel, Mr. Data. Channel is open, sir. Vorn responding to hail. On screen. Let's get this over with. In good time, Duras. Even in death, K'mpec makes foolish decisions. You should not be involved in this. The Sonchi ceremony will take place in one hour aboard K'mpec's vessel. One hour? What is the delay? There is no delay. It is the time I have chosen. Exactly one hour, Picard. Do not be late. Keep that ""pahtk"" away from the ceremony, Picard! He has no place on a Klingon ship. Picard out. Contact Gowron's ship. Tell him to meet us on K'mpec's vessel. Ambassador, meet me in transporter room six in one hour. We will begin the ceremony a little late. Mr. Worf. Mr. Worf, the next few days will be difficult for you. You have made it clear I am to perform my regular duties, sir. I want you to know that I am aware of your discomfort. Thank you, sir. Ambassador K'Ehleyr will be preparing me for my role in the rite... Permission to speak freely, sir? Granted. Duras must not be allowed to lead the Council. He has a legal claim, Mr. Worf. Your personal feelings... It is not personal, sir. His father betrayed my people to the Romulans. Duras is a traitor! Klingon tradition may hold the son responsible for his father's sin, I cannot. Treason was his father's crime. Duras' crime... was to lay that blame on your father. I will not forget that. But you should not forget that you chose to accept the consequences of that lie. To preserve the Empire. The issue now is whether or not he killed K'mpec. Sir? He was murdered. Poisoned. A Klingon would not use poison. His murder would have no honour. K'mpec believed that it was either Duras or Gowron. Well, I know little of Gowron. He is an outsider who has often challenged the Council, but Duras,... ..l know him. His heart is not Klingon. That's Gowron. I hope this will be brief. It will be just long enough to prove that K'mpec is dead. Now, complete the Rite of Succession. It's obvious who the challengers are. We will proceed according to traditions and precedents set down in Klingon law. What do you know of Klingon law,... ..human? We will reconvene on the Enterprise. No. Finish it here! Now! I have not received your report on the explosion. Two Klingons killed. A few minor injuries. Were you concerned about me? As Head of Security, it is my duty to be... concerned. Is that it? Just official concern for my well-being? You know my feelings. Maybe I've forgotten. You were right, I would have insisted we take the oath. But not just because of tradition. I thought about telling you. Wanted to tell you. But I wasn't ready. When I left, you said you'd never be complete without me. It took some time, but... I came to realize that... I need you, too. You're a part of me, Worf. No. I can't allow you to suffer my humiliation. There would be no suffering. I don't care what others think. What of the boy? He may want to live in the Empire some day. He would be outcast. Another traitor from a family of traitors. Family of traitors, I don't believe that for a minute. Respect my wishes in this matter. I cannot take the oath with you. Nor can I claim your son. If you cannot be his father,... ..at least be his friend. We haven't yet analyzed the bomb debris. Dr Crusher is studying the remains of the men killed. We need more time. Duras and Gowron are due. You can't delay this meeting again. Is there any way of stretching out the formalities once they arrive? The modern rite is just a proclamation that two challengers have been chosen. Modern rite? How was the ritual performed in the past? The old forms dictated that challengers perform the ja'chuq. It's a long ceremony in which the challengers list the battles they have won, prizes taken, proving their worthiness to lead the Council. Can the old form still be used? It's up to you. You can use whatever form you want. Thank you. Captain,... what do you know about Worf's discommendation? My interest is personal. I understand you were there, that you stood by him before the Council. I'd like to know what happened. I'm sorry, I can't discuss it. Council must have a leader now! Complete the rite so I can kill this ha'DIBah! You will die... slowly,... Duras. You have already proved you haven't the courage to face me. Why not plant another bomb? Sit down. We will begin the ja'chuq. What? This woman has given you bad advice, Picard. The ja'chuq is obsolete. It is my choice to respect the ancient rituals. Each of you will have to prove your worthiness to lead the High Council. That will take hours. Or days, depending on your co-operation. What is this? A bat'leth. It belonged to my father. It has been in our family for ten generations. Let me hold it. No, no, no. Do not think of it as a weapon. Make it part of your hand,... ..part of your arm. Make it part of you. The next meeting is in three hours. I would speak with you alone, Ambassador. I'm honoured. Picard is prolonging the ja'chuq. Why? He has sufficient reason to proceed carefully. He relies on you for his knowledge of Klingon law? Yes. Then he values your advice. You could quicken the pace. Possibly. Why should l? Your position is... unique. Have you never wondered about serving the Klingon Empire? I serve in my own way. As a Federation ambassador? A few rewards,... but little glory. What do you want? What do you want? Command of a ship? A seat on the Council? There are many opportunities for you in the Empire. Opportunities that will present themselves only if you come to power. You talk like a Ferengi! K'mpec was also stubborn. He, too, refused to listen. Now,... he is gone. You need not make the same mistake. K'mpec was old and weak. I am not. We've completed our analysis of the bomb. It was a triceron derivative. Only three cubic millimetres big. It could have been hidden anywhere. There's one more thing. The bomb had a molecular-decay detonator. Only one race uses that device, sir. The Romulans. How could the Romulans plant a bomb on board a Klingon attack cruiser? It would be impossible. Not if the Romulans had help from one of the Klingons. Klingons and Romulans have been blood enemies for 75 years. Perhaps Duras or Gowron wishes to improve relations. A new Klingon alliance with the Romulans? If true, it would represent a fundamental shift of power in the quadrant. Yes. It would put the Federation in a difficult position. Duras or Gowron? Gowron came to me alone. Wanted me to speed up the ja'chuq. Offered me a seat on the Council if I'd help him. That doesn't mean a Romulan connection. He also implied I'd end up like K'mpec if I didn't cooperate. Captain, I disagree. It must be Duras. Why? We have had prior dealings with Duras that show him to be untrustworthy. Can you be more specific? No. Mr. Worf, we have a conspiracy on our hands that could be a direct threat to the security of the Federation. Yes, sir. As Chief Security Officer, I want you at the next proceeding. Captain, they will be incensed. My presence will be disruptive. Yes,... it will. Computer, list dates of the last Enterprise mission to the Klingon home planet. Star dates 43685 through 43689. How many ship's logs during that period? 43 officers' logs, ten personal logs. Is there a personal log for Lt Worf? Affirmative. Access is restricted. Eliminate all personal logs. List the remaining 43 in order. We'll just take them one at a time. Both your claims have been made and recorded. We are ready for the final phase of the ja'chuq. There will be a recess while I review your petitions. You're as concerned as I am about the explosion aboard K'mpec's vessel. I assume you are both continuing your investigations? The investigations are complete. They revealed nothing of importance. Now, that's very surprising. Our analysis turned up some... startling results. Will you join us, Lieutenant? What is this? He has no place here, Picard! I will not sit at the same table! It is my prerogative to investigate anything that may be relevant to the Rite of Succession. Lt Worf is my chief security officer. His presence is required. We will not proceed. If you wish to withdraw from the ja'chuq... ..that is your option. Proceed, Mr. Worf. What did your investigations reveal? It was a bomb. And was your analysis just as insightful? It was a common explosive. What type? Triceron. What about the detonator? This is pointless! The findings were inconclusive. Fortunately, our investigation was more thorough. The bomb used a molecular-decay detonator. What? A Romulan device. I will return to my ship to confirm these... conclusions myself. As will l. Mr. Worf, please be sure to send a complete record of our findings to both vessels and to the High Council. Aye, sir. That will be all. Computer, interlock with the Klingon Imperial Information Net. Interlock established. Ambassador K'Ehleyr requesting access to High Council records. Security code pah doQ cha. Proceed. Display summary of most recent High Council inquiry regarding Khitomer massacre. Access denied. Restricted materials. Du-ko-cha clearance only. By whose order? Council Member Duras. Access biographical files. Subject's name, Councillor Duras. Advise my counsellors on the Vorn to convene. There is much to discuss. Look. What is this? Priority message from the home planet. Ambassador K'Ehleyr is looking into things she should not be. Distract the guard for me. Yes, sir. Sir. Excuse me, sir, you cannot leave without an escort. Come. I have been informed of your attempt to access restricted records. I am investigating Khitomer. Not an easy task, considering that most of the records are sealed. Worf's father was a traitor! No, the evidence was altered to make it appear that way. I found it interesting that your father was also at Khitomer and you are the one who sealed the records. You dare insult my father's name? Don't play the wounded Klingon, Duras, you don't do it very well. What happened in that council chamber? How did you get Worf to take the blame for you? Do not pursue this matter. The son betrays his people to the Romulans, just as his father did, Duras. One of the Klingons who died was with Duras, the other was with Gowron. I've examined the bodies, trying to get a clue as to where the bomb was hidden. There's always a pattern in the lacerations and tissue damage. It normally indicates the direction, distance, force of impact. Normally? In this case, the pattern was virtually impossible to detect. I couldn't understand it until I saw the dynoscans. This wound is different from all of the others. It was made from the inside out. The bomb was implanted in one of their forearms. It's considered an honourable way for a Klingon to die, a suicide that takes an enemy with it. Which one of them was it? Duras' man. When we have more time, I will demonstrate in more detail. Medical emergency! Deck eight! Room 142! Gowron? No. Duras! Alexander,... You have never seen death. Then, look. And always remember. Stay with the doctor. Worf, when did you...? Multiple stab wounds. Trauma to the internal organs. There wasn't time enough to take her into stasis. Where's Worf? I don't know. He just disappeared. Riker to Lt Worf. Computer, locate Lt Worf. Lt Worf is not aboard the Enterprise. Where is he? Lt Worf transported to the Klingon ship Vorn at 1730 hours. On my way. Duras. What is that doing here? He has claimed the right of vengeance. You have no rights here, traitor. K'Ehleyr... ..was my mate. If Lt Worf resists? He's coming back, one way or another. Set phasers on maximum stun. I'm the only one, Worf, who can prove your innocence. Kill me and you're a traitor for ever. Then, that is how it shall be. Worf! Mr. Worf, your service aboard the Enterprise has been exemplary. Until now. Sir, I have acted within the boundaries of Klingon law. The High Council agrees. They consider the matter closed. I don't. Mr. Worf, the Enterprise crew currently includes representatives from 13 planets. They each have their individual beliefs and I respect them all. But they have all chosen to serve Starfleet. If anyone cannot perform his or her duty, because of the demands of their society, they should resign. Do you wish to resign? No, sir. I had hoped you would not throw away a promising career. I understand your loss. We all admired K'Ehleyr. A reprimand will appear on your record. Dismissed. Mr. Worf,... ..isn't it time for the truth about your father's innocence to be told? You only accepted this dishonour to protect the name of Duras and hold the Empire together. Now that he has died in disgrace, what is gained by further silence? Each member of the Klingon High Council has shared in that lie. They will not be so willing to admit their own dishonour. But the day will come when my brother and I will... ..convince them to speak the truth. My parents,... my human parents, will meet us at Starbase 73. They will care for you. Why can't I stay with you? You deserve a home,... a family. They can provide that. I cannot. I miss her, too. Are you my father? Yes. I am your father. "
S4E08,"Captain's log, star date 44286.5. The Enterprise is conducting a survey of the Onias Sector near the Neutral Zone. Despite our proximity to the Romulans, the mission has been quiet and uneventful. You've got until your next birthday to get it right. Some things improve with age. Your playing may be one of them. It's candle time, birthday boy. Alright! So what did you wish for, Will? Music lessons. Mr. Data, we must hurry or we'll miss Cmdr Riker's party. Sir, I find it interesting how much importance humans place on celebrating their birthday, a day they cannot remember. Captain, I am detecting some unusual fluctuations in subspace frequencies. You better take a look at it, Mr. Data. It appears we are being probed, sir. Source? The third planet of the Alpha Onias System. Our reports list it as uninhabited. Perhaps reports were incorrect, sir. Maybe the rumours of a secret Romulan base in this sector are true. Picard to Cmdr Riker. I apologize for interrupting your celebration, but I need an away team. Report to the bridge, please. Although Alpha Onias Ill is a class-M planet, our survey teams have listed it as barren and inhospitable. Any life signs? No, sir. There are residual energy readings in a cavern 2km beneath the surface. Romulans? It is possible. I suppose you'll have to go down and find out. Geordi, Worf, you're with me. Number One. Happy birthday. I'm detecting high levels of volcanic gases. Sulphur dioxide, methane,... hydrogen sulphide. Toxic? We're OK, but I wouldn't want to spend my vacation here. Energy readings? Magnetic clutter is rising. I cannot make a clear determination. Same here, Commander. A lot of confusing readings here. Picard to Riker. Acknowledge. Riker here. We're having trouble reading you. We're having similar difficulties. I advise you and your away team to transport up at once. That's good advice. We've got a build-up of gases. Especially methane. Transporter room. Take us up. I can't get a solid lock on you, sir. Too much interference. I'm trying again. Transporter, what's happening? I'm trying again, sir. Dr Crusher, he's awake. Beverly. Will. You remember me. That's good. What else do you remember, Captain? Captain? Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Water, three Celsius. How do you feel? Confused. That's understandable considering what's happened. What has happened? What happened to sickbay? To you? To me? Sit down, Captain. Captain? I am Cmdr William T Riker. What is going on here? Sit. Please. What is the last thing that you remember clearly? Alpha Onias Ill. The Enterprise had been probed. Geordi, Worf and I transported down to track the source. But all you found there was toxic gas. They barely had time to get the three of you out. Will, that happened 1 6 years ago. That's not possible. With an Altarian virus anything is possible. In fact, we've been expecting this. Could you be more specific? That day on Onias Ill, you were infected with a strain of Altarian encephalitis, a retrovirus that incorporates its DNA into the cells of its host. It can lie dormant for many years and then become active again, as it did in your case ten days ago. You have been in a coma, delirious. Your fever finally broke this morning. But what happened to my memory? Let me show you a scan of your brain tissue. When the encephalitis became active, it caused synapse degradation, interrupting the consolidation of your memory. Doctor! Will,... this virus inevitably causes memory loss back to the moment of the original infection. In your case, all the way back to Alpha Onias Ill. I don't believe this. Is this a dream? Feel my hand. It is flesh and bone. This is not a dream and you are, in fact, Capt William T Riker, in command of the Enterprise. The Enterprise. For how long? Nine years. If I have lost my memory, how do I get it back? Memories are formed by association. Smells, sounds, and images from the present could possibly trigger them. Like a song reminds you of an old friend? Exactly. In associational therapy, you're exposed to familiar surroundings. This could stimulate the brain's synapses into regenerating. Let's start. Nothing's more familiar than the Enterprise. Maybe that will bring back... Will... I said your memory could return. In many of these cases the damage is permanent. What about Geordi and Worf? Were they infected? Thankfully, no. Geordi seems immune and Klingons aren't affected. Speaking of Klingons... There've been quite a few changes on board in the last 1 6 years. Deck eight. Belay that order. We should begin the therapy in your quarters. Personal recollections are most vivid. My life was on the main bridge. Always has been. If anything's going to jog my memory... Main bridge. Repeat command. I said main bridge. Computer's been slow all morning. An attenuator's down. Cmdr La Forge has been running a diagnostic on it to isolate the problem. Geordi. It's good to see you up and about again, sir. What happened to your visor? My visor? Dr Crusher told us that you might not remember. I haven't needed a visor since I got cloned implants. Captain. Welcome back, Captain. We did not expect you on the bridge so soon. Cmdr Data. You're my first officer? Do you remember, sir? I haven't remembered a day for the last 1 6 years. Captain, war bird uncloaking. On screen. Shields up! Red alert! Captain, we were expecting the Decius. There is no cause for alarm. Cancel red alert. Clearly I need to be briefed. Captain, the Decius is hailing us. The Admiral wishes to speak to you. On screen. Will. Admiral Picard. Deanna. How are you feeling? I've been better. Not surprising. Altarian viruses can be a nasty business. That's an understatement. I can't... We'll discuss this after we've transported. Out. Transporter room six. How are you holding up? I could get used to the idea of a Ferengi ensign, but Admiral Picard aboard a Romulan war bird? What is that all about? I think I should leave all the explanations to the Admiral. Whenever you're ready, Chief. Capt Riker. It's good to see you've recovered. I'm not sure you'd call it a recovery. Then there has been some memory loss? How much? Everything after Alpha Onias Ill. To lose 1 6 years! It's almost beyond belief. I have trouble believing it myself. It's overwhelming to have so much of your life missing. And it's happened at a bad time. A few more days of negotiation and the treaty will be signed. What negotiations? What treaty? Sorry. I'll start at the beginning,... ..which is four years ago. A Romulan cruiser strayed into Federation space. Its warp coils had collapsed, life support was failing. You saved them, Will, you and the Enterprise. The Romulans were... impressed to say the least. After years of distrust and conflict, they started to talk. You were our key spokesman in securing the alliance with them. How far have these negotiations progressed? Preliminaries are over, so now we escort their ambassador to the final session. Where you will complete negotiations and sign the treaty. Captain... Admiral. I am in no condition to negotiate with the Romulans or anyone else. Will, you're sound of mind and body. If you are properly briefed, you can fulfil your duty. With a 1 6-year gap in my head? We do need you. Sir,... I'm not fit to resume command. I appreciate your can dour, but despite your condition, there is no one better equipped to deal with the Romulans than you. When do we leave? As soon as the ambassador transports over from the Decius. We will get through this,... as we have many times before. I hope so. Let me take you to your quarters. Good idea. I've had enough surprises for one day. Anything familiar? Hi, Dad. And then Mr. Greenberg asked about the Fornax disaster. And I knew the Enterprise saved all the colonists, but I didn't know... Here it is. But I didn't know the exact star date of when their sun went nova, so if you tell it to me, I'll write it down and won't forget. You don't... remember me, do you? I'm sorry. I need to talk to your father, Jean-Luc. Would you mind leaving us alone? Why didn't you warn me? Beverly hoped that meeting him like this might make an impact. Help you remember. Well, it made an impact alright. Give it time. Jean-Luc? Yes. The Admiral was very pleased when you chose that name. He's a wonderful boy. Deanna,... ..who's his mother? She died two years ago. A shuttle accident. I'm sorry, Will. I have no recollection of her at all. What was she like? Min was... beautiful, of course, strong, intelligent, patient. Well, if she was married to me, she had to be patient. She was an excellent captain's wife and a very good ship's counsellor. She took over after I left. I can't imagine you leaving the Enterprise. Admiral Picard offered me a position at Starfleet Command. It was a tremendous opportunity. I couldn't refuse. But... what's important right now, today, is that you have a son who needs you. Spend time with him. You may find part of what you've lost. Pretty bad, huh? I've heard better. I've practised, but I can't get a good tone. Too much pressure on the mouthpiece. Relax. Don't use any unnecessary muscles. Show me again. Left hand, right hand. 1 6 years, you'd think I'd be able to hit that. Come on, Dad, you always make that mistake. Computer, summarize service record, Riker, William T, Captain. Begin with the Fornax disaster. Please, restate question. Service record, Riker, William T! Dammit! Dad? Computer lag. I can't believe Geordi's still running his diagnostic. Is... that what you wanted? Picard to Riker. The Romulan ambassador is ready to transport over from the Decius. On my way. I'd better go. Sure. Dad. Everything's gonna be fine. Thanks. Bye. Troi tells me you met Jean-Luc. How's my namesake holding up? Better than I am. We did our best to prepare him. I'm trying to catch up with all this. I've still got a long way to go. Just follow my lead with the ambassador. You'll be fine. The Decius reports the ambassador is waiting to transport. Beam him aboard. Admiral Picard, Capt Riker, it's good to see you again. Ambassador Tomalak. Welcome aboard the Enterprise. Thank you. It is an honour to be the first Romulan to freely walk about a Federation starship. Ambassador Tomalak? At Nelvana III, he threatened to take the Enterprise home as a war trophy. That was a long time ago. Many things have changed,... including Tomalak. As soon as we arrive at Outpost 23, the negotiations should go quickly. I agree. All the issues have been resolved. After much debate. Your Capt Riker is a negotiator even the Ferengi should avoid. But we have come to an agreement both sides are happy with. And we are grateful. The alliance will greatly benefit my people. As I hope it will benefit mine. It will, Captain, it will. Main bridge. The virus you contracted, have you fully recovered? I assure you Capt Riker is quite well. He's looking forward to attending the negotiations. Excellent. The signing of this treaty is an historic occasion. You, of all people, deserve to be there. Thank you,... Ambassador. So this is the bridge of the Enterprise. And this, I assume, is your tactical position. Impressive. Excuse me. Admiral, Deanne, I need a moment with you. Cmdr Data, accompany the ambassador on his tour. Certainly, sir. Excuse us, Ambassador. Ambassador, you may find this of interest. These new sensors are capable of pinpointing power emissions of a cloaked war bird at warp. Are you saying you trust Tomalak? I trust the process we have built with the Romulans. They have nothing to gain by betrayal. No? You've always said it's chess with them. Move, countermove, guile and deceit. I sense no such dishonesty in Tomalak. His desire for peace is sincere. He wants this alliance. There's no cause for concern. No cause for concern? We're talking about revealing the location of Outpost 23, the key to all our defences in the Neutral Zone. I'm sorry, Will, your information is out of date. The strategic importance of Outpost 23 is minimal, has been for years. Dr Crusher to Riker. Are you there? What is it? Your son's injured. He's been taken to sickbay. You'd better come down right away. Dad. Are you alright? I'm fine. What happened? It's broken, but it's going to be alright in just a minute. Now, let's go easy on this arm for a little while, OK? How'd this happen? I was in the gym playing parrises squares. Parrises squares? I fell off the ramp. At your age? You could break your neck! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Continue the compression for two minutes. Yes, Doctor. Can I talk to you for a moment? I'll be right back. How old were you when you started playing parrises squares? Alright, I was probably a little younger than he is. It's just that, for all practical purposes, this is my first day as a father and he almost kills himself. He didn't almost kill himself. He just broke his wrist, like a lot of other boys his age. You're right. It's difficult. Difficult for you? What about for Jean-Luc? Can you imagine how he feels? You've lost 1 6 years. Jean-Luc has lost a lot more than that. First his mother,... and now his father. Good as new. You can take him home. Thanks. How's the arm? It's fine. Dad,... I'm really sorry. I know you have more important things... There is nothing more important than this, son. Captain. Deck eight. Halt. I know how hard this is for you. It's OK, Dad. No, OK's not good enough. When I was your age,... my own father wasn't there for me. And I really needed him. I've often wondered what kind of father I'd be. I never felt quite ready. The idea even scared me a little. Scared? You? Yeah. But I got over it. You're here. Resume. It's important to me that I don't let you down, Jean-Luc. You never have, Dad. You've always been there for me. I'll have to take your word for that because I don't remember any of it. Your first step, your first tooth, nothing. And I want to remember. There's only one thing we can do. We've gotta build some new memories. It might be in the memory banks. I had a great fishing program. The Curtis Creek program? You know it. Sure, we've gone there lots. Like to go again? You bet. As soon as the negotiations are over, we'll go fishing. Great. Then Mom tried to net the fish and she fell in the creek, too. You tried to pull us both out and you fell in. I'm not sure I want to remember that. Mom really liked Curtis Creek. We went there for picnics and stuff lots of times. What was she like? She was great. I think of her a lot. I'd better go change. Computer. Display family record, Riker, William T. Limit to visual. Display family record, Riker, Mrs. William T. Please, restate request. Damn! What's wrong, Dad? The computer still isn't working. I can't get a visual of your mother. I know Mom's pictures are in there. Did you give a star date? Computer. Display family record, Riker, Mrs. William T, home file. Star date 5841 6. Min! Minuet. Mom was beautiful, wasn't she? Yes. What's wrong? La Forge to Riker. Riker here. Please, come to the bridge. On my way. What's the problem? I've shut down the warp engines. Why? Antimatter fields are fluctuating. Nothing to worry about. We're near the Neutral Zone and you're not concerned? I'll get the engines back on line. Like you tracked down that faulty accelerator? I'm running a level-one diagnostic. For 30 hours? You only need four. You are incapable of that level of incompetence, Mr. La Forge! Worf,... where did you get that scar? In combat. What battle? When? Which sector? Which unit? Mr. Data, if we left immediately, when would we arrive at Outpost 23? At warp one, three days, four hours. What about at warp seven? At warp eight? At warp nine? What happened to those millions of calculations per second? I am experiencing interference which limits my abilities. I can't operate... What did you say? I said I cannot... No! You said, ""I can't"". You used a contraction, didn't you? Sir, I can explain... No, you can't! Don't even try! Captain, perhaps it would be best if we discussed this... Shut up! I beg your pardon? I said, ""Shut up!"" As in close your mouth and stop talking! Will, I sense how upset you are. You're angry and impatient. Deanna, back off. Well,... ..would anyone else like to speak up? Or shall we end this charade? As you wish, Cmdr Riker. The charade is over. The Enterprise? My son? You created it all? With the help of our scanners and what you would call a holodeck. Now, please tell me, how did you discover the truth? The future we created for you should have been convincing. It wasn't. There was a computer time-lag for one thing. Unavoidable. Our scanners have a limited response time, so whenever you strayed from our expectations... But surely that was not enough... To smash your house of cards? No. It was the visual record of my wife, Minuet. Bad move. We chose someone from your past who is still alive, a woman you were very attracted to. Your mistake, Tomalak. Minuet was nothing more than a computer fantasy I once experienced on another holodeck. Impossible. In your mind that woman exists, physically. Your feelings toward her remain quite passionate. She was part of a very special program. So much effort, so little accomplished. If it was Outpost 23 you were after, why didn't you use your neural scanners to probe my mind? They are calibrated for Romulan brain patterns. With humans they are less efficient. There were gaps in what we got from your memory. Gaps? From what I saw, I find that hard to believe. You recreated the Enterprise, the crew, every nuance and smell, sound, with perfect accuracy. I didn't see any gaps. I don't buy it, Tomalak. We're wasting time. Bring him. When you transported here, you were less than a kilometer from this base. Your capture was a simple matter. Where are my colleagues? We allowed them to transport back, but your signal was diverted. They won't stop looking for me. They already have. Please, say hello to your son. Jean-Luc? That is not his name, nor have you ever really met him. We merely used his image to augment your program. What have you done to him? While I am gone, please give careful thought to your situation. What's your name? If we're going to get out, you have to trust me. Easy. I'm not going to hurt you. Who are you? How did you get here? My name is Will. Ethan. They brought me here with my parents. We were at a research station at Miridian VI. Miridian VI? On the edge of the Neutral Zone? I thought that was uninhabited. The station was set up last year. Then the Romulans came. It's odd that the Enterprise wasn't advised. Where are your parents now? They took them away. Do you know why they're keeping you here? No. I just want to get away. I'll get us out of here, Ethan. How? Even if we do get away, they'll find us. They found me when I escaped before. You escaped? Yes. I hid in a secret place,... for weeks. They caught me when I came out to find food. I want that information, Commander. I want the location of Outpost 23. Very well. I have permission to use whatever means are necessary. Ethan! No! Stop him! That secret hiding place of yours? This way. In here. The sensors should pick us up. No, they can't. I heard them. There's something in the rocks. Heavy metals? Right. The Romulans forgot this room when they rebuilt their tunnels. Here. Use these. Help me. After I escaped last time, I mapped out all their tunnels. Supply depot, communications, living quarters and shuttle bay. How many guards in the shuttle bay? Only two or three. A shuttle would get us nowhere. The Romulans could follow their own ship too easily. But if we broke into their communications system,... ..we could send a message to the Enterprise. We can't do that. The transmitter is a voice-activated security system. Whose voice activates it? Only Ambassador Tomalak. Who? Tomalak. Ambassador Tomalak? Tomalak is a Romulan captain. The only time he was an ambassador was in a holodeck fantasy. How do you know about that? You... told me about him. Who are you? What is your part in all this? They've found us! You said the sensors didn't work. They must have fixed 'em. We gotta go! Where are we going, Ethan? The shuttle bay. There's still time. I've had enough. Commander, surrender your weapon. No more games. No more fantasies. I'm not gonna play any more. It was never the Romulans. It was you all along, wasn't it? There's no question about it, sir. It is his signal. Picard to Cmdr Riker, do you read me? Riker to Picard. I'm here. Are you alright? Yes, sir. What about Geordi and Worf? They beamed up. They're fine. But we lost you in mid-transport. What is going on down there? I'm not sure yet, sir. But I think I'm about to find out. Stand by. What shall I call you? Ethan? Jean-Luc? It doesn't matter. This room is more than a holodeck? Much more. The neural scanners read my mind, give me anything I want. They tried to give you everything you wanted. Everything I wanted? You probed the Enterprise. You lured us here so you could play games. I didn't want that. You did. Why? My world was invaded! My people... killed. My mother brought me here so our enemies would never find me. They found her, didn't they? She knew they would never stop looking for her. So she made sure I would be safe. She left the scanners to protect me. To give me anything I wanted. Anything? Then why did you kidnap me? I wanted you to stay. It's been so long. I just want somebody... real. I thought that you'd be happy. I'm sorry. I have to return to my ship. Come with me. You don't have to stay here any more. You don't have to be alone any more. My name is Barash. To me, you'll always be Jean-Luc. Two to transport. "
S4E09,"Captain's log, star date 44307.3. I'm preparing to leave by shuttle for Pentarus V, where I'm to mediate a dispute among salenite miners, a contentious group, unfortunately prone to violence. But, first, I must deal with a situation of a far more personal nature. Sir? I summoned you almost ten minutes ago. Sir, I'm sorry. I was in the middle of an experiment with volatile compounds. I couldn't just leave... Excuses! No, I was... That will not go down well at Starfleet Academy. Yes, sir, I'm aware of that. The Academy? I just received a message from Admiral Nsomeka. She expects you to report in two weeks. A position has opened up in this year's class. Thank you. You'll have to work overtime in order to catch up. I have assured the Admiral you can. Don't make a liar out of me. No, sir, I won't. For your final mission, you will accompany me to Pentarus V while I try to sort out the problems with the miners. You've studied the effects of outpost judiciary decisions on Federation law. What better way to get experience? Captain, I'm picking up a general distress signal from Gamelan V. On screen. Please! Does anyone read us? Open a channel. I'm Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise. Captain, I am Chairman Songi of Gamelan V. An unidentified spacecraft has entered orbit above our planet. Radiation levels in our atmosphere have increased by 3,000 per cent. We can only assume we are under attack. But the ship will not answer our hails. We are a peaceful planet with no ability to defend ourselves. Please! Can you help us? Mr. Data, are we close enough for a scan? No, sir, we are out of range. Any other ships in that sector? Negative, Commander. We'll proceed immediately to your planet. Thank you, Captain. Take the Enterprise and investigate. Crusher and I will go to Pentarus V. Our shuttle leaves in ten minutes. Yes, sir. I've noticed here that your thrusters are rigged in a configuration I've never seen before. It's my own modification. It's more efficient. You can study it if you want. Excuse me, Captain. I've run safety and operationals. Everything checks out, but I can't attest to its comfort. Capt Picard. Capt Dirgo of the shuttle Nenebek. Captain! It's good to meet you. Captain? Of a mining shuttle? Yes, Ensign, Captain. My ship isn't pretty, she isn't big, but we've logged almost 10,000 hours together. Yes, she seems a very... ..a very sturdy craft. We should go. Captain, will you take ops? I'll let Crusher perform that task. I have to study up on Regalian law. Shuttlecraft has cleared the bay. Ensign Allenby, set a course for the Gamelan system. Warp six. Aye-aye, sir. You've done this before? Yes. If your captain isn't tougher than he looks, those miners'll tear him apart. Don't worry about Capt Picard, he'll handle them. I've lost navigation! The port thruster quad's gone. Guidance coupling system's severed. I can't stabilize her! Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. The port thruster module blew. Nenebek to Enterprise. Emergency. Do you read? Pentarus Station, come in! Communication's gone! Is navigation functioning? Negative. Switching to manual. 50 million kilometres to Pentarus V. We may have to put down somewhere else. Mr. Crusher, scan for a class-M environment. Aye, sir. I'll have to throttle back on the main impulse engines. One of the moons around Pentarus Ill registers as Class-M, barely. The mean surface temperature is 55 Celsius. Life forms indicated? No, but scanning is limited. There's a strong magnetic field. We don't have a choice! Save the impulse engine for controlled entry. Mr. Crusher, reconfigure working thrusters to manual input. I'll try, but this grid's 100 years old. We don't have the Federation's resources! Captain, take the helm. I'm rerouting the deuterium flow. Hull temperature 700 degrees! Beginning braking manoeuvre. We're below Mach one. Bypass the thrusters now. Brace yourselves for impact! Dear God! Let's salvage what we can. The first thing we'll need is shelter from the sun. In this heat the shuttle will act like an oven. All the systems are out. Can't get a communication channel. Location transponder's gone, too. Let's check the craft for something to protect our heads and eyes. Captain, recover your medical supplies, food and water rations. Well, the medical supplies are alright. Food and water? The replicator,... ..damaged beyond repair. Surely you have emergency supplies? This isn't a starship. I have to choose what I carry. Are you telling me... there's no water? Scanning. The vessel reads as an unmanned freighter. Origin? Indeterminate. Propulsion appears to use a gaseous fission reactor, now non-functioning. Radiation levels from that ship are off the scale. Could that be engine leakage? No. Engine reactor elements have been inactive for approximately 300 years. The vessel is carrying various unstable waste products. You mean, it's a garbage scow? Precisely. Mr. Worf, open a hailing frequency. Chairman Songi, this is Cmdr Riker on the Enterprise. Yes, Commander? You have inherited someone else's problem. An old waste vessel caught by your planet's gravitational pull. Are your people suffering radiation sickness? Not yet, but some areas are already detecting dangerous levels. We'll do our best to remove it quickly. Thank you, Commander. We're gonna push that barge into the Gamelan sun. Sir, the Meltasion asteroid belt lies between here and the sun. Then we'll use our deflectors to clear a path through. I don't like the idea of getting that close. We'd be risking the contamination of the entire crew. Do you have a better idea, Geordi? Send a module to attach thrusters. Direct it through the asteroids from a safe distance. A message from the mining settlement on Pentarus V. The shuttle carrying Capt Picard has not yet arrived. They left here at 0800 hours. They have asked if we are beginning a search. Tell them we have an emergency. We will begin a search after that. Aye, sir. Mr. La Forge, prepare to launch the construction module. I'd like to get this over with as fast as possible. Any luck with the tricorder? I think so. Scanning range may be limited, but it's better than nothing. These were on board, they work. Excellent. Our communicators may not be able to get through this magnetic field. I'm fashioning an arrow. If a search party finds the wreckage,... ..they'll know we've headed for those mountains. Are you crazy? They're too far, we'll never make it. We can't survive in this sun. Where there's mountains... there's shelter. You've no right to make decisions, I'm the Captain of this ship. If you want to get out of this, listen to Capt Picard! He'll keep us alive. Thank you. That's enough. Capt Dirgo, you're an able pilot, I welcome your input. Do you feel there is an alternative? No. Very well. I suggest a steady pace, not a brisk one. We need to ration our energy. Breathe through your nose. It'll help to prevent dehydration. I'll lead. Captain, will you bring up the rear? And you were worried about how tough the Captain is? Did you find water? No, not yet. What are you doing with that? Mr. Crusher! I'm not sure, sir. It's an energy reading. Energy reading? What kind? Low frequency EM. It gets stronger the closer we get to those mountains. What are you saying? Is something over there, waiting for us? I'm not sure. It keeps registering as a repeating energy pattern. Are you suggesting that this energy is not naturally occurring? These readings could indicate electromagnetic properties in the rocks. But I don't think so. A life form? It's possible. The pattern is fairly organized. Well, we can't go back. And we can't stay here. We've got to keep going for those mountains. No matter what is waiting for us. There has to be water in here. Aren't caves formed by water? Not necessarily. This could be created by volcanic activity. Lava flow. These walls are dry. Do you have any moisture reading? No. But that EM reading,... ..the pattern's changed. The frequency's peaking a lot higher. You have water! I wouldn't hide water. That's called dresci. It's from my planet. It's alcohol. It's medicinal, for emergencies. I was gonna share it with you. This would make your thirst worse. Well, I'll take my chances. I won't let you waste this. This is more valuable to us as a coolant or disinfectant. It's mine! Stow it with the medical supplies. Keep your eye on it. We'll explore the cave. Mr. Crusher, look out for signs of water, no matter how faint. Capt Dirgo, will you lead the way? The bulk of the radiation will affect three small island groups. Fortunately, they're very sparsely populated. We'll replicate hyronalin and transport it to them if necessary. Coordinate with the medics on the planet. Beverly? We've contacted the nearest Star base research vessel. I'm afraid the closest one is almost a week away. I see. Thank you. But we asked the mining settlement to send any vessels they might have. You know,... there are many reasons why the shuttle may have been delayed. Deanna, thank you. But I'm alright. And right now, I have work to do. The miners report they have very few operable shuttlecraft. When will we join them? Tell them to stand by. Aye. Thrusters attached and ready. Initiate prefire sequence. Transmitted. Thrusters to stand-by. Fire thrusters. Gradual acceleration to 40 per cent power. We've lost one. Correcting vectors to compensate. Structural integrity compromised. Disintegration is continuing. Shut down thrusters. Go to 1,000 metres ahead of the barge and hold. External radiation increasing, sir. Coming into position. Extend our shields. Lock on the tractor beam. Aye, sir. Warning. Radiation levels at 70 millirads per minute and rising. Set a new course. We'll take it through the asteroids. One quarter impulse. Aye. Dr Crusher, to the bridge. On my way. Project the impact of the radiation on the crew. Mr. Worf, contact the mining settlement. Tell them we won't be joining the search for a while. I knew there had to be water. What was that? A confined annular force-field. Placed there to protect the water. Yes. Deactivation must be possible. We can... with our phasers. I don't think it would be wise... Captain, the EM reading,... the power level's spiking now. I think it's working! Dirgo! Stop firing! Apply pressure to that wound. This is the worst break. What was that thing? Keep the pressure constant! Ensign,... how bad is it? Your right leg is broken. You have a fracture in your left arm. And you took a blow to the head. But the bleeding's under control. Well done. I'm going to be fine. I just... ..just need... to get my breath. Are you telling the truth? What truth? He's bleeding inside. I've seen it before. He's never gonna survive. You don't know what you're talking about. You're wasting your time. Will you save that dresci for us? Mr. Dirgo, I'd appreciate it if you didn't bury me before I'm gone. The trouble is... he could be right. No, he's not, sir. You're gonna be fine. Wesley,... ..you are gonna have to keep a... a rein on Dirgo. He's wilful. And stubborn. That's dangerous. You'll handle him, sir. Wesley, listen to me. I have no feeling in my right leg. My vision is blurred. I'm going to get worse... not better. I'm not gonna be able to help you. You are gonna have to stand up to Dirgo on your own. Yes, sir. Hey. Good man. First Officer's log, star date 44307.6. Radiation levels on the Enterprise continue to rise. Hyronalin is being pumped into our air supply to counteract the effects. At the rate the radiation levels are increasing, the hyronalin will only be effective for another 38 minutes. Medical unit one, evacuate and seal off non-operational areas. Group crew and families on decks nine and ten. Radiation exposure protocol. Acknowledged. How long will it take us to get through the asteroid belt? 51 minutes, 14 seconds. There'll be casualties if we can't get there faster. How much more can we get out of that beam? We're at the limits of our towing speed. Let's establish a new upper limit. Yes, sir. Monitor the shearing effect on the beam. Increasing to one-half impulse. Beam is holding. Shearing force, 80 metric tonnes. Move to three-quarters impulse. Shearing force, 92 metric tonnes. 93. Tractor beam is destabilizing. We will lose the barge, Commander. Reduce power. One-half impulse. Geordi, stabilize that beam. I can't divert any more power, we're at our thermal limits. We could use more fusion reactors, but we're running at peak coolant pressure. Do it. Warning. Radiation levels at 150 millirads per minute and rising. Lethal exposure in 35 minutes. Look at that. The phaser. How did this happen? That thing did it. These are selenium fibres. Electrically deposited. The EM pattern is back down. It only peaks when we move towards the water. Whatever we saw must act like a sentry to try to guard the fountain. When we're not moving towards the water, the wave pattern stays low. Right here between five and 15 megahertz. Dirgo, move toward the fountain. Dirgo. There. It just went to 40. What is this getting us? We've got to get to the water. If I can manipulate the frequency, maybe I can control it. The sentry first appeared when you used your phaser. It could respond to heat or energy... If you're right, a phaser could lure it. Hold on. We need to know what we're dealing with. Enough talking, it's time to do something. I'll start firing. When it comes, you fire and draw it. I can't! Put yours on automatic. Leave it on that ledge and take cover. Why will it go for my phaser and not for yours? Because I'll fire on a low setting, you use maximum. What says it responds to high settings?! We should figure out our options... Meanwhile, your captain is dying! Wounds like that, most men would be dead already. If he doesn't get water... When I start firing, you better do your part. First Officer's log, supplemental. La Forge has diverted power from auxiliary generators in an attempt to stabilize the tractor beam. It's the only hope of increasing speed, so we can clear the asteroids before the radiation becomes fatal. Warning. Radiation levels at 300 millirads per minute, and rising. Lethal exposure in one minute. Ready. I'll rotate reactor output, but it should still be enough power. Proceed. Going to three-quarters impulse. Shearing force at 103 metric tonnes. Tractor beam is stable. Full impulse. Beam is holding. Warning. Lethal exposure in 30 seconds. Within visual range of the asteroids. On screen. Warning. Lethal radiation exposure in 15 seconds. Prepare to cut it loose. Warning. Lethal exposure in 10 seconds. We've cleared the asteroids, sir. Let it go. Cold. When the sun went down, the temperature really dropped. This should help. Good. Thank you. I'm not much good to you, Wesley. Sir,... ..Dirgo is dead. I should have tried harder to stop him, but he... Captain! Capt Picard! Sir, stay with me. I'm trying. Sir. Do you remember when we took the shuttle together to Star base 515? I was dreading it. Six hours alone with you! But it didn't turn out the way that I thought. You opened up to me. I... I kind of got to know you. It's my fault that you're here. I shouldn't have asked you. Sir, I'm honoured you wanted me along. I was selfish. I thought l... ..wouldn't see you again. I'm sorry. Sir,... in the past three years,... ..I've lived more than most people do in a lifetime. I think I'm very lucky. No matter what happens. How many people get to serve with Jean-Luc Picard? Sir,... ..you don't know this,... ..no one knows this,... ..cos I've never told anyone. All of the things that I've worked for,... ..school,... ..my science projects,... ..getting into the Academy,... ..I've done it all because I want you to be proud of me. If there is one thing that I have learned from you... ..it's that you don't quit. And I'm not gonna quit now. You've thought your way out of worse than this, and I'm gonna think us out of this. You're not gonna die. I'm not gonna let you die. I'll get to the water. And I'll keep you alive until they find us. I promise. First Officer's log, supplemental. We are returning to the last known location of the missing shuttle. Are you certain? It is definitely debris, the primary material is duranium, with smaller amounts of sonodanite and ermanium. Most shuttle hulls are duranium. Then they're gone. Not necessarily. There's far too little debris to account for a shuttle. So what is it? Dirgo's thrusters were rigged funny. Claimed it was in case one blew. It may have left this debris. If only one thruster blew, he could have set down somewhere. The only class-M planets here are Pentarus Il and V, both of them have been searched by the miners. Then, we'll search them again. Four moons in the system could support life. Have the miners searched them? Not yet, sir. Which one is closest to the debris? Lambda Paz, one of the moons of Pentarus Ill. Set a course, Ensign. Ensign, where are we? We crashed, sir. We're in a cave. I need water. Sir, we don't have any water. Don't you remember? We tried to get to the fountain and Capt Dirgo... Yes,... I remember. I think I'm on to something. I've analyzed the sentry's energy patterns. Wesley,... I may not make it. I've used the transponder from my communicator to modify my tricorder... No. Listen. ..to interrupt the sentry's electrics. Stop it, maybe slow it down. Listen to me. Yes, sir. There's so much I wanted to tell you. The Academy,... ..there's someone,... ..someone who meant a great deal to me. He's been there for... For ever. Someone you must get to know. His name is Boothby. Now,... you tell him... that you and I were friends. Now,... when I was there, he... helped me. Listen to him. What does he teach? He's the groundskeeper. He's one of the wisest men I ever knew. I envy you,... Wesley Crusher. You're just at the beginning of the adventure. Go on. Get the water. Stay alive. They'll find you. I'll be back soon. Of course. You remember,... ..l was always proud of you. It worked! Captain? Capt Picard? Wake up. Captain? Wesley? Mom? Yes! Mom! Wesley, thank God! I am so happy to see you. You're OK. Come on. How did you find us? We found the wreckage and the arrow indicating your direction. Take Wesley by stretcher as well. No, I can walk. Doctor. We're taking you back to the Enterprise. We've stabilized your vital signs. Alright, let's go now. One moment. Mr. Crusher? Yes, sir? What are you doing in such a filthy uniform? You don't look so shipshape yourself, sir. Wesley,... ..you will be missed. "
S4E10,"It's been five months since Marc's accident. I haven't missed a single hour of my duties. I volunteered for extra time in the nursery. My language studies are better than they've ever been. Somebody else might've given in, but I didn't. Given in to what? Death is a normal part of life. Maybe some of us are better at facing that than others. Maybe some of us aren't facing it at all. What do you mean? Recovery from a great loss involves a great deal of pain. If we try to avoid that pain, we make it harder in the long run. But I feel fine. Today would have been your husband's 38th birthday. You keep excellent records, Deanna. Last night... I dreamt Marc was with me, celebrating. I was so glad that this nonsense was finally over. Then I woke up. Alone. And I knew that he was dead. For the first time, I knew it. I looked around for anything that belonged to him. Anything. I forgot that after the funeral I told them to take it all away. What in the world was I thinking? They didn't take everything away. How did you know? An ancient trail along the Kabul river in the Himalayas. Wonderful program. It would do you good to have some fresh holodeck air. My horsemanship is a little rusty for the Himalayas. Thanks anyway. Nonsense. We programme an appropriately docile steed... Captain, sensors indicate a vast field of... Of what, Lieutenant? It's gone. But something did appear in our path. Shields are not reporting excessive interstellar matter. A sensor echo, Data? Uncertain. I have no unusual readings. I promise I'll come by and see you tomorrow. Are you alright? What? What? You faded out there for a second. No, no, I'm fine. I'm just very tired, that's all. Will I see you tomorrow? Tomorrow. Thank you. An aggregate field of plane-polarized objects has just appeared. And disappeared. Recommend we run a diagnostic on the forward sensor. We don't want a ghost tailing us all the way to T'lli Beta. I'm not convinced it is a ghost. There may be something there. Ensign Allenby, full stop. Aye, sir. Let's investigate both possibilities. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, star date 44356.9. Sensor diagnostics were completed and indicate all systems are normal. There remains no explanation for the images which appeared in our path. I have completed another full scan, sir. There is no further indication of the anomaly. Ensign, prepare to resume course for T'lli Beta. Mr. Data, what velocity would put us back on schedule? Resuming course at warp six will place us in the T'lli Beta system in 6 days, 13 hours, 47 minutes. What, no seconds? I have discovered a certain impatience when I calculate a lengthy time interval to the nearest second. However, if you wish... No, no. Minutes is fine. Stand ready at warp six, Ensign. Aye, sir. Engage. Geordi, what the hell happened? Checking. The field collapsed before we could enter warp. Recommend full stop. Back to all stop, Ensign. Decks report minor injuries only. Damage? None. Weapons and shields normal. Go to yellow alert. Captain, we've started moving again. Something is pulling us. Troi to Dr Crusher. Yes, Deanna? Beverly, I'm feeling very dizzy. Did you hit your head? I'm not sure. I'm not sure what happened. Lie down and stay calm. I'm getting calls from all over. I'll come as fast as I can. New heading confirmed: 025.273. Speed holding at one-tenth impulse. Whatever's pulling us isn't in a hurry. Mr. La Forge, if your engines are functioning we'll try to break free. Everything down here seems normal, but I suggest we take it a bit slower this time. Ensign, bring us around 90 degrees to starboard. New course laid in. One quarter impulse, engage. Aye sir. Nothing, Captain. Speed and course are unaffected. One-half impulse. No change. Full impulse. Rotate heading five degrees at a time. Aye, sir. La Forge? There's nothing wrong down here. The engines are fine. Integrity-field stress 82 million kilodynes. Recommend immediate shutdown. Make it so, Ensign. All engines down. We're still being pulled. Same heading, same speed. I got here as quickly as I could. Sickbay's filled with headaches. How are you? When I first called you, I was feeling intense pain. Now it's gone, but I'm feeling a bit foggy. I'd like to run an inner nuncial series on you. Can you walk? All senior staff to the observation lounge. Are you up to that? I think so. What is it? Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine. Could it be some sort of tractor beam? No other ship is indicated. Mr. Worf, what is your analysis? Sensor readings are indeterminate. They don't even give us enough for a guess. Yet our sensors are operating properly. Can there be an intelligence at work here? Counsellor, do you sense a life form out there? No, I don't think so. No. There's nothing. Nothing! I sense nothing. It's alright. Perhaps there's nothing out there to sense. Many races are not empathically detectable. The Breen, the Ferengi... No. You don't understand. I don't sense anything. Not out there, not in here. All of you, you're all blank to me. No indication of a concussion or a blow to the head. Just a pattern of unresponsive neural cells in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex. Unresponsive? There's brain damage. How serious, I can't tell yet. But I feel perfectly fine otherwise. Can you treat it? I'm not sure. I have to review the database on Betazoid neurophysiology. The Betazoid brain has a remarkable ability to heal itself. This condition could reverse itself in time. It might. But you are half-human. That changes the map a little. I don't want to offer you any false hopes. It's just hope, Beverly. Not false hope. What would cause this? It started when we encountered the anomaly. There may be a connection. I don't know. If you were anyone else, you know what I'd do? I'd send you to Counsellor Troi. Then I have an advantage, don't l? I see her quite often. Deanna, it's no different than one of us suddenly going blind. No need to tell me. I understand the psychology. You may, but you've never had to live with it. I may be perfectly fine tomorrow. And you may not. I'll do my homework. I'll see what I can do to regenerate those cells. In the meantime, I want you to talk with someone. There are several people on board who are qualified therapists. OK, fine. If I need to. Right now, I just want to go back to work. Deanna... If there are no medical objections? No medical objections. Thank you, Beverly. Will. Come in. I don't have a psychology degree, but if you want to talk... You know what the worst part of this is? I've seen it happen to so many patients. What? The way other people change. How they start to treat you differently. They walk on eggshells around you. Sometimes they avoid you altogether. Sometimes they become overbearing, reach out a helping hand to the blind woman! I'm sorry if l... I will not be treated that way! I'm sorry. Oh, please! Deanna, I've never seen you quite so scared. I'm fine. If I get better, I get better. If I don't, I'll adapt. Life goes on. I really have to finish this. I have some appointments this afternoon. Probe launch successful. Transmissions are being received. Let's see what we've got. Nothing unusual here. The same reading as the ship's sensors. Expanding analysis parameters. Including Bayesian functions,... ..broad EM and subspace spectrum polling. No change. I am adding virtual particle trajectories. What... is that? Unknown. I am attempting to analyze motion pattern. Results still inconclusive. Last time I saw anything like that I was skin-diving off the reefs at Bracas V. You said you woke up a new woman this morning. That's how I feel. Tell me about her, this new woman. She's... not holding anything back any more. She's not? I let it all out last night. I cried for two hours. I realized I had never accepted the loss of my husband. I worked hard, I kept busy, I did everything to pretend it never happened. And you feel different now? Completely. Can I share something important with you? Of course. I have temporarily lost my empathic sense. It's like having one hand tied behind your back. I am so sorry. Do you want me to come back? No, no, I'm fine. It's just... before we continue, it's important that you know that, OK? Alright. Because I can't tell how you're feeling this morning. But it seems to me, one night of crying can't make up for months of denial. No. You're wrong. I feel better today than I have in ages. You're absolutely wrong, Deanna. The probe reveals that the objects exist entirely in two dimensions, on a single plane. They have length and width, but not height. Virtually flat. That is why the ship's sensors did not detect them initially. We were looking along their edge. There was no surface. I will illustrate. Are they a life form? The movement pattern is not a naturally occurring phenomenon in the Newtonian sense. They appear to be alive. Do you know why they're pulling us along with them? Somehow they can polarize the graviton field. We're caught in the wake. How do we get out? We could overload the warp drive and jump directly to warp six. The laws of a three-dimensional universe allow it. But in a two-dimensional universe... Fascinating. So many questions. How can a two-dimensional entity have access to our universe? And are they aware of us? Number One, if we can put off the T'lli Betans, I would like to investigate this as soon as we escape the graviton field. It's a shame we can't tell if they're sentient. What do you mean by that? I'm doing the best that I can. No one suggested otherwise. Mr. Data, try to isolate any signal patterns from the cluster. Perhaps we can communicate. Mr. La Forge, we'll attempt your warp jump. That'll be all. Counsellor... How are you feeling? Beverly, I can't do my job. I'm absolutely lost. You have to do something. I cross-referenced your scan results with the baseline files. Nothing helpful has turned up. And so far the lab work is inconclusive. What does that mean? It means there is nothing I can do now. I am still trying. How do you people live like this? We get by pretty well, actually. And so will you, in time. You have no idea! No idea. How can you know what it's like to lose something you never had? I don't claim to. Yet you tell me to get used to it. In my position, what would you tell me? In your position, I wouldn't have been in here treating skinned elbows while you were passed out on your office floor. I'd have been here sooner. Perhaps in time to prevent this from happening! I have been working with Ensign Brooks since her husband's death. She's avoided the reality of what happened, denied it to herself. I realize I've been doing the same thing about my condition. It's perfectly understandable. It's time I accept the truth... ..and resign as ship's counsellor. Resign? I can't fulfil my obligations. What other option is there? I've been fortunate to have use of your Betazoid abilities. Most starship captains have to be content with a human counsellor. Empathic awareness is not a requirement of your position. It is for me. I'm sure that you'll be able to adjust. They say when one loses a sense, the other senses become stronger to compensate. A blind man develops better hearing. With all due respect, Captain, you don't know what you're talking about. That is a common belief with no scientific basis, no doubt created by normal people who felt uncomfortable around the disabled. I am disabled, and I'm telling you I cannot perform my duties. A teacher of mine had been confined to a wheelchair from birth... Captain, spare me the inspirational anecdote. And just accept my resignation. Come in. I really would rather be alone right now. Too bad. Is this how you handle all your personnel problems? Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi. Or Worf! Will, I don't know what to do. So you resign? You walk away from all the people who care about you? I look around me and all I see are surfaces without depth. Colourless. Hollow. Nothing seems real. I'm real. No, you're not. You're a projection, with no more substance to me than a character on the holodeck. I don't believe that. You have no idea how frightening it is to... to just be here without sensing you, without sharing your feelings. That's it, isn't it? We're on equal footing now. What? You always had an advantage. A bit of control of every situation. That must have been a very safe position to be in. To be honest... I always thought there was something too... aristocratic about your Betazoid heritage. As if your human side wasn't quite good enough for you. That isn't true. Isn't it? La Forge to Riker. Go ahead, Geordi. We are ready to attempt a controlled overload jump to warp six. Acknowledged. I'm on my way to the bridge. I'll check in on you later. Really, you don't have to. I will check in on you later. Setting new course at optimal shearing angle. Bearing 217.203. Engaging impulse engines... now. Mr. La Forge, go to warp. Aye, sir. Status? Unchanged. We have not shaken off the graviton field. Integrity-field pressure has increased by 217 percent. Warning. Differential stress will exceed upper limit in 15 seconds. Disengage all engines. Engines disengaged, sir. Report. The energy for the nacelles was absorbed by the graviton wake. It set up a wave that rebounded back to the ship. We're lucky we're still in one piece. This little nuisance is losing its fascination. During our attempt to break away, I recorded a change in the movement pattern within the cluster. Think we got their attention? Perhaps, but just for an instant. The pattern immediately returned to its previous dynamic. Follow up on it, Mr. Data. Input that into the universal translator. Perhaps these movements themselves are an attempt at communication. More tea? Didn't mean to startle you. That's alright. I'm getting used to it. May l? Sure. Are you really getting used to it? No. Do you want to talk about it? No. Good. I get so tired of people coming in with their problems. They want a shoulder to cry on. Generally it turns out to be mine. You'd make a good counsellor. I think so, too. So I'm going to talk to Picard about it. About what? You becoming Counsellor? Well, yes. You're leaving. That means there won't be a counsellor on board. I suppose I'll have a very long line at that bar. It would be nice to have a nice office, too. It's more than just letting them cry on your shoulder. It takes an enormous commitment. I can do that. Guinan... People come to talk to you about things they want to reveal. As Counsellor, you get them to talk about things they don't want to reveal. I could do that, too. What are you...? You don't really want to be Ship's Counsellor. What would make you say that? I just know you're not serious. Have I given you any indication that I might not be serious? Not really, but... Then how do you know? Are your empathic abilities coming back? No. I suppose it's just instinctive. I get it. You're trying to make me see that I have other abilities to draw on. Human intuition, instincts. Guinan, those skills only develop after years of experience. It's not that easy. No one said it was easy. It's much harder than you think. Human intuition and instinct are not always right. But they do make life interesting. So I'm discovering. Problem, Data? Yes, Commander. Sensors are detecting highly accelerated interstellar gases. Suggesting? Uncertain, sir. The entity is within visual range. On screen. Magnify. It appears to be a cosmic string fragment. Only 107km long. A cosmic string? No wider than a proton, but with gravitational fields as powerful as a black hole. The two-dimensional beings seem to be caught in its pull. Their course is taking them directly toward it. And us right along with it. Captain's log, star date 44359.5. What began as an inconvenience has turned into a serious threat. At current speed the two-dimensional beings and the ship will be drawn into the cosmic-string fragment in seven hours. The entities appear to be unaware of the string fragment. Their course and speed are constant. Sir, I recommend we fire photon torpedoes into their field. Must we destroy them to save ourselves? It is unclear what effect a photon torpedo would have on them, sir. Nevertheless. We wouldn't necessarily have to fire at them. A few torpedo bursts in their path could make them change course. Make it so. Torpedoes armed, fire distribution set. Detonation at 7km ahead of the cluster. Launch another probe. Patch the monitor through to the main viewer. Probe is launched. On screen. Proceed, Mr. Worf. Launching torpedoes. Detonation in five seconds. Three... two... one. There is no change in the graviton field. The torpedoes had no effect. Fire another volley... directly into their field, Mr. Worf. Launching torpedoes. Detonation in five seconds. Three... two... one. Matter-antimatter explosions appear to be ineffective, sir. Come in. Janet! Oh, I'm sorry. I meant to cancel your appointment. Actually, I'm resigning as Ship's Counsellor. Why? I think it was fairly clear during your last appointment. It was obviously non-productive. I couldn't sense what you were feeling. Deanna, you were right about me. I had to go back and look at what I was doing, see why I was trying to convince myself, and you, that I was a new woman. You made me realize I was doing exactly the same as I was before. Trying to hide from the pain. Maybe you couldn't sense what I was feeling,... ..but you helped. Come. You wanted to see me, Captain? Yes, Counsellor. Sit down, please. Our situation has become critical. The cluster remains unresponsive. We cannot alter its course towards the string fragment. How much time do we have? Less than five hours. Which is why I have called you. Sir? All that remains is the possibility of communication. There might be a way we can warn them of their impending destruction. Hasn't Data tried to communicate through the universal translator? He has tried every technical means at our disposal to reach them. I wish I knew how to help, but under the circumstances... If they have a psychology, we must discover it. If there is an explanation for their behaviour, we must know what it is. Even in your current condition, you are best qualified to assist. Data is attempting to devise a strategy. I want you to join him. We need you. Supplemental log. If our speed and course remain unchanged, in one hour the Enterprise will be torn apart by the gravitational forces of the cosmic-string fragment. Are your signals reaching them? Possibly. However, the beings may perceive them as negligible noise rather than an attempt at communication. Is there any evidence they're sentient? Negative. Their movement suggests a simple order of intelligence. I'm sorry, Data. I don't seem to be much help without my empathic abilities. I just don't know how to draw on my human instinct. As I do not have human instinct per se, I cannot advise you, Counsellor. Right now... I feel as two-dimensional as our friends out there. In the universe, but barely aware of it. Just trying to survive... ..on instinct. Data, what if they're simply acting instinctively? There are inherent, inborn forces in every species. What they need, what they fear. We have to discover what drives this species. I do not believe there is any way we can know for certain. We can speculate on the available evidence. All we have is the brief interruption in their movement pattern during our last attempt to escape. Which may suggest some kind of awareness of our presence. Otherwise their course and speed have been constant. On a straight line to the cosmic string. You're sure the string's gravitation is pulling them in? The cluster is two-dimensional, so I do not have enough direct evidence. However, it is the most reasonable hypothesis. Why? I doubt they would intentionally move toward a destructive force. Moths fly toward a flame. Horses sometimes run into a burning barn. Data, don't you see? We've been thinking in three dimensions. We have to get two-dimensional. Pardon me? Subspace signals, photon torpedoes. Nothing's had an impact. It's reasonable to wonder if a gravitational pull, even as strong as a cosmic string, would affect them. Please continue. What if they've chosen a course to the cosmic string? A case of pure stimulus-response, driven by instinct, just like the moth to a flame. If Counsellor Troi's theory is correct, a replica of the string projected behind the cluster could make them change course, disrupting them long enough for us to escape. How do you simulate a cosmic string? It has the gravitational force of a hundred stars. I do not suggest simulating the string's gravitational field, rather its vibration. We're not talking about a violin, Data! Data's right. The principle is still the same. A string emanates characteristic frequencies as atomic particles decay along its event horizon. With our parabolic dish, we could reflect them back toward the cluster. The Enterprise itself would echo the cosmic string. How much time do we have, Mr. Worf? 23 minutes, sir. Make it so. Frequency-scan detectors engaged. Receiving. We're picking up frequencies across the entire electromagnetic and lower-subspace spectrum. Trying to isolate. Can you focus the reflector field? Stand by. I am differentiating particle emission-signatures now. Good. Good, that's doing it. Patterns are converging. Same course, same speed. No change, sir. We're encountering the gravitational pull of the string. Impact is in four minutes. Sir, turbulence prevents us creating an accurate simulation. Geordi, fire up the impulse engines. Activate the stabilizers. Stabilizers on. Electromagnetic and subspace wave fronts approaching synchronization. Three minutes to impact. Status? The cluster is unaffected. Same course, same speed. Let's try turning up the volume. Increase the intensity, Mr. Data. Increasing by 50 percent. They're slowing. Graviton-wake field is collapsing. Mr. La Forge, get us out of here. With pleasure, sir. The beings have resumed their course into the string. Three seconds to impact. It's alright. They're home. We were wrong. The cosmic string was never dangerous to them. It was the one place in the galaxy they most wanted to be. Deanna? Yes. I sensed it. Such overwhelming intensity of emotion. When we encountered them, it must have been more than I could process. A short circuit. Something like that! Oh, Beverly! Apology accepted. Therapists are always the worst patients. Except for doctors, of course. Come by and see me in my office later, OK? I was so awful to her. Well, you were just being human. I never fully appreciated how difficult, and how rewarding, it is to be human. But I had a lot of help. Thanks. Now, is that counsellor position still open aboard ship? It's been taken. Just thought I'd ask. Better hours. Excuse me. And you. Thank you for making me face my other half. Frightening, isn't it? A little! You were right, though. There is something to be learned when you're not always in control. Welcome to the human race. By the way, the next time you call me aristocratic... ! "
S4E11,"Second Officer's personal log, star date 44390. 1. Record entry for transmission to Cmdr Bruce Maddox, Cybernetics Division, Daystrom Institute. Dear Cmdr Maddox, in reference to your most recent letter, I agree that your study lacks information on my programming and operation. In response to your request, this message will include a record of my activities during a normal day, with emphasis on my perceptions of friendship. Cmdr Riker, you are 15 minutes early. The father of the bride should be relieved early on the wedding day. Thank you, sir. Nervous? I cannot become nervous. However, I sense some anticipation regarding my role in the wedding. Anything to report? All systems are normal. Sickbay reports that Lt Juarez went into labour at 0400 hours. We await the Starship Zhukov. Guest quarters are ready for Ambassador T'Pel. Thank you. I have the bridge? Aye, sir. Begin day watch. Initially, Cmdr Maddox, I found it hard to maintain friendships. Human emotions often puzzle me. I developed a program enabling me to predict human emotional responses to specific actions. Come in. It is time for the wedding rehearsal. I know. I've decided not to go through with it. You do not wish to rehearse? No, I'm calling off the wedding. May I ask why? It's just the right thing to do. Have your feelings for Chief O'Brien changed? I'm getting married. I should be happy, but I'm not. I just feel this weight pressing down on me. Will cancelling the wedding make you happy? Yes. He'll probably be just as relieved as I am. Data? You introduced us to each other. You mean a lot to both of us. I would really appreciate it if you would talk to Miles for me. If you wish. Chief O'Brien often says he wants to make Keiko happy. Since cancelling the wedding will make her happy, I must conclude that he'll be pleased. I have good news. Keiko has made a decision to increase her happiness. She has cancelled the wedding. She what? Cancelled the wedding? Today? Without even a word? Of all the childish, selfish, irresponsible things to do! Next time, maybe I should deliver the good news. It seems that my program designed to predict emotional responses needs... adjustment. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Second Officer's personal log. This is the 1,550th day since the Enterprise was commissioned. Besides the arrival of T'Pel, events today include four birthdays, two personal transfers, the Hindu Festival of Lights, two chess tournaments, a school play and four promotions. An ordinary day. The Zhukov is ready for transport. Energize. Welcome aboard, Ambassador. I would meet with your Captain. Since I am not affected by emotions, I am closer to being Vulcan than human. However, while their devotion to logic has a certain appeal, I find their stark philosophy to be somewhat limited. Come. Ambassador T'Pel. I come to serve. Your service honours us. This is Cmdr William Riker. Leave us, please. Charming woman! The tone of Cmdr Riker's voice makes me suspect that he is not serious about finding T'Pel charming. My experience suggests that he may mean the exact opposite. Irony is a form of expression I have not yet mastered. You don't need a haircut. You were here last week. If you'd done it right first time, I wouldn't be back. You want to look beautiful, but I'm a barber, not a miracle worker. Just try to keep my ears on straight today, OK? Friendly insults and jibes, another form of human speech I am attempting to master, in this case, with the help of Geordi. Hi, Data. I consider Geordi to be my best friend. Here for a trim? My hair does not need trimming, you lunkhead. What? My hair does not... Lunkhead? I am experimenting with friendly insults. It was not serious. Well, just don't try it on the Captain. No. Geordi, I am still confused by Chief O'Brien's reaction this morning. Yeah. He was just surprised. He didn't mean to blow up. He knows Keiko probably doesn't want to call off the marriage. She's just getting cold feet. Cold feet? Jitters. A nervous reaction to an impending event of importance. Right. Don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine. She'll change her mind again. She will? Absolutely. You believe the marriage will proceed? Trust me. They're gonna get married. So you'd better find a gift. I find Lt Worf to be what is called a kindred spirit. We were both orphans rescued by Starfleet. In many ways we are both outsiders in human society. Are you here for a wedding gift? Yes. I would appreciate help in selecting an appropriate item. Of course. I have attended human weddings before. Hold. This is a traditional gift? Yes. My adoptive parents often give these... things at family weddings. A human custom. Hold. It is my understanding that the gift should reflect the personality of whoever is giving it. This does not remind me of you. Have you ever been an actual participant in a human wedding? No! You would not consider it to be an honour? An honour? Perhaps. But human bonding rituals often involve a great deal of talking and dancing and crying. Dancing! I am rarely in need of Dr Crusher's professional services, as my maintenance program is self-sufficient. But I often observe as she practises medicine and have learned much about human interaction from her. May I ask a favour of you? Of course. Would you teach me to dance? What?! I would like to learn to dance. Why me? It was in your service record. First prize, tap and jazz competition... OK. OK. Have I said something to upset you? It's just that that was a long time ago. I don't want to be known as ""The Dancing Doctor"" again. Then your answer is no. Alright. But let's keep this between you and me. Of course, Doctor. Cmdr Data, report to the bridge. Acknowledged. I want a projection of possible Romulan deployments along the Neutral Zone. Access Federation records and report to me. Is there a specific area you wish me to study? No. Ambassador? Number One, set a course 130, mark 246, warp seven. That's close to the Neutral Zone. I'm aware of that, Number One. Proceed. Lay in the course. It is fortunate that I can perform my duties without emotional distractions. If that were not the case, a sudden course correction toward the Neutral Zone would make me very... nervous. Mr. Data, based on your analysis, what is the Romulan strategy behind the deployment of their ships? Their ships are deployed to support a policy of confrontation to test our defences along the Neutral Zone. Do you predict any change? There is a 90 percent probability they will continue that policy. Is there any indication of a more conciliatory attitude on their part? No, sir. Caution is clearly called for. But the mission must proceed as planned. Starfleet Command agrees with you. But I would feel better if you would consent to an escort or... Thank you, Mr. Data. Feline supplement... ..74. Computer, run fluidic-sensor diagnostic. Diagnostic complete. All systems functioning within normal parameters. Come in. Am I intruding? No. Would you care to sit down? When one of my friends is distraught, the thoughtful thing to do is to try to make him feel more comfortable. May I offer you some refreshment? No, thank you, sir. I'd like to apologize for this morning in ten-forward. There is no need to apologize. I was not offended. Would you like a pillow or a more comfortable chair? No, sir. Thank you, sir. Perhaps you would like some music? Brahms? No, really, sir, I'm fine. I came to ask for your help. It's about Keiko. I'd like you to convince her to go through with the wedding. Would Troi not be a more appropriate choice to speak to Keiko? She already has. Didn't help. You've known her longer than I have, I thought she might listen to you. She won't even talk to me. I do not know what to say to her. Just talk with her. Make her see reason. She's not thinking this through. You've worked with her for a long time. She respects your opinion. Perhaps... Perhaps she has not fully analyzed her decision. I will try. Thank you, sir. I won't forget this. Cmdr Maddox, Keiko was calm and rational when she informed me of her decision. Therefore I predict that she will respond to an objective analysis of the situation. She has not let emotional considerations cloud her judgement, which should make my task simpler. What?! You made an incorrect analysis of the facts. What do you mean? You do not seem happy. Well... You made the assumption that cancelling the wedding would make you happy. This has proven to be incorrect. It's not that simple. Since your action did not produce the desired result, you should re-examine your decision-making process, and look for errors. It's my decision! That fact is not in dispute. But you may have acted with haste and hurt Chief O'Brien's feelings. I did what I had to! Why are you doing this? I thought you were my friend. I am. Then leave me alone. If I have offended... Just leave me alone! It is clear I need guidance to resolve this situation. Counsellor Troi's advice should be useful. In many ways, she is the friend I understand least. Her life and duties are predicated on her understanding of emotions. Since I have none, no doubt she finds me as much a mystery as I find her. Chief O'Brien talks to me. Keiko talks to you. Why do they not talk to each other? That's a good question. I wish I had a good answer. Perhaps when they're ready, they will. Many aspects of this situation puzzle me. I have studied texts on marriage, but I have not found a suitable guide. A suitable guide for what? To be helpful, I am attempting to calculate the variables involved in a successful marriage. Good luck. There are many opinions. On Galvin V, a marriage is seen as successful only if children are produced within a year of the marriage. Andorian marriages require groups of four... Would you like my advice on how to help them? Don't. This is something they must work out for themselves. But I am their friend. Should I not stand with them in a time of difficulty? There are many ways to help a friend. Sometimes, the best way is to leave them alone. Do you believe it is the correct decision for them to marry? I don't know. They're in love, but sometimes that isn't enough. Marriage is an agreement to share who you are with someone else. To live together. To grow old together. To grow old together? That is a component of marriage? Usually. Why do you ask? Although I am an android, I have not excluded the possibility that l, too, may someday marry. I had no idea you'd thought about getting married. I believe I have much to offer a potential mate. But we cannot grow old together because I will not grow old. Data? You do have a lot to offer. Cmdr Data, this is Ambassador T'Pel. Report to my quarters. Acknowledged. Enter. You have priority-three clearance on the Enterprise? That is correct. I require information on this ship's defence and navigational systems, access code Kappa Alpha 4601704. The code is valid. What is the strength of the ship's deflector shields at maximum output? May I ask the purpose of your request? I require this information. I have the same safeguards as the ship's computer. I report any inquiry about restricted information to the Captain. Your reaction suggests you do not wish him to know of your inquiry. I was not interested in the information. I was curious as to your security safeguards. They seem adequate. Cancel the request. You may leave. Cmdr Maddox, I have often wished for the sense humans call intuition or instinct. Since Vulcans are incapable of lying, I must accept her explanation as truth. But I would prefer a... gut feeling to back up this conclusion. Program Crusher four in progress. Hi, Data. Well, what do you think? It is a recreation of a studio I had my first dance lesson in. It appears to be quite suitable. Let's start with something simple. Stomp. Hop. Try it. Again. Good! Good! Am I dancing, Doctor? Not quite. Stop, Data. Now try this... Perhaps it would be beneficial to teach me the final lesson. OK. That's great! Watch. Good. Triples. Watch. Stop, Data. And you say you've never done this before? Try this. Stop, Data! Not bad. Yeah, not bad. I have learned to dance? I'd say you've picked up the basics. Thank you. I am now prepared to dance at the wedding. Wedding? Keiko's wedding. You never said this was for the wedding. Is that important? Yes! They don't do much tap-dancing at weddings. Why? Well, Data, because... I don't really know why. Why don't I teach you a style of dancing that they will do at the wedding? Computer, run... Isn't it Romantic? Compared to what we've done, this will be simple. Just look up and follow me. One, two, ready and... No, Data, wait. No. Move slowly. Stop music. Sorry, Doctor. I don't understand. You picked up tap-dancing so quickly. I cannot copy you if I cannot see your feet. Alright. Let's try it again. And this time, watch my feet. Computer? Start music. And... Now, don't just imitate me. You've got to lead. Lead where? Indicate where you want your partner to step. How is that accomplished? I'll show you. I'll lead. You'll notice that I don't just repeat the same pattern. I improvise. Now you lead. That's good! Now look up, Data. Look into my eyes. You're holding me too tight. These are complex variables to coordinate. You are doing fine. Now, smile. Act like you're enjoying yourself. Dr Crusher? Report to sickbay. Is it Lt Juarez? Yes. Her contractions are one minute apart. I'm on my way. Why don't you program up an artificial dance partner? Don't be afraid to experiment! I will. Thank you, Doctor. Computer? Create dance partner. Female. Begin music. And just as he swings the axe... Cmdr Riker's easy-going manner and humour is fascinating to me. It may be one reason he is so popular with the crew. It may be responsible for his success in matters of love. There may be a correlation between humour and sex. The need for more research is clearly indicated. Commander. Picard to the bridge. All stop. Aye, sir. Sir, we have reached the designated coordinates. Hold this position. Long-range scan. Captain, I am detecting a ship in the Neutral Zone. Configuration, Romulan war bird. Yellow alert. Hail the war bird, Mr. Worf. Aye, sir. They are responding. Text only. ""We are to proceed to the agreed coordinates."" Set course 037, mark 005, warp four. Take us into the Neutral Zone. The war bird is holding position. In three minutes, we will be in phaser range. Red alert. I trust my crew, Ambassador. They will take no provocative action unless I order them. Hold position on these coordinates. Slow to half-impulse. Open a channel. Open. I am Ambassador T'Pel. I am Admiral Mendak. There is no established protocol for this meeting. The logical course is that I transport over for the negotiations. Yes. Captain? I note your defensive systems have been activated. As have yours. It was not meant as an accusation. I salute your show of strength. Ambassador, we are honoured by your presence. Transport aboard at your convenience. The honour is mine. Have your transporter room stand by. I will beam aboard without delay. Ambassador, I urge you to once more reconsider. The Enterprise can accommodate a Romulan delegation... I find your argument illogical. Please carry out my instructions. Picard to Chief O'Brien. O'Brien here. Prepare to transport Ambassador T'Pel. Aye, sir. Mr. Worf, maintain a lock on her signal. I want to be able to bring her back. Understood. Transporter activated. Captain! Transporter emergency! I'm losing her signal. Boosting power to sequencers. Computer override. What happened? I'm losing the pattern. Trying to re-establish! I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't retrieve the signal. The Ambassador's dead. Second Officer's personal log, supplemental. The risks aboard a starship are accepted by all who serve, but I always observe a deep emotional response to the loss of a comrade. At times like this, I miss the ability to share human feelings. The signal lock wasn't broken. I had entered the sequence when her pattern began to break up. I tried to switch to manual control, but the pattern deteriorated too quickly. There is no record of this type of accident on a starship. Backups and safeguards are designed to prevent it. I can't find any system flaws. Engineering reports were normal. The auto-sequencers were functioning normally. Any prior malfunctions? No. We replaced the transition coil last week. Was it Romulan interference? Not that I could see. The shields were down. There was no subspace bias. Pull this unit and check the systems. I want a diagnostic on all transporters. Yes, sir. Her molecular structure dissipated once the pattern was lost. There wasn't enough material to do an autopsy. To die... ..on a transporter. Hardly a fitting end for one of the Federation's most honoured diplomats. Bridge to Capt Picard. Admiral Mendak wishes to speak to you. We're still waiting. Is there a problem? There's been an accident. Ambassador T'Pel was killed in a transporter malfunction. What kind of malfunction? We are still investigating that. I see the Federation isn't serious about this conference. The Federation places the highest priority on this mission and its goal. Well played, Captain. Well played. Starfleet opposes normalization of relations with the Romulan Empire, so you are ordered to create an accident. You are mistaken. I am ready to discuss the establishment of diplomatic relations under the same terms as Ambassador T'Pel. A generous offer, since you know we were willing to negotiate only with T'Pel. I salute you again. It was a manoeuvre worthy of a Romulan. I suggest we both leave the Neutral Zone before there is another... accident. Set course for Federation territory. Warp two. Engage. Mr. Data, take charge of this investigation. Study computer logs, sensor information, everything. I refuse to believe this was a malfunction! Aye, sir. Capt Picard was the person who interested me in the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I have become an admirer of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes and his ability to solve mysteries by examination of evidence. I find Holmes' methodology of deductive reasoning to be useful. One of his adages is once you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. I'm sorry. I don't have time for another lesson. That is not my purpose. I wish to examine the remains of Ambassador T'Pel. I'm working on the report right now. Have you compared the genetic code with the Ambassador's last-recorded ID traces? No. That's not procedure. Why? I could be chasing an untamed ornithoid without cause. A wild-goose chase? Alright. Computer, access the transporter ID trace for Ambassador T'Pel. Here's the genetic record of the Ambassador when she beamed aboard. The organic material found on the transporter pad should be identical. Mitochondrial structure fits the general parameters. No change in the nucleotide bases. There's a slight discrepancy in the base-pair sequence. Chemically, these are identical. But the sample from the transporter is showing single-bit errors, like replicated material. Can you postulate an explanation for the discrepancy? The DNA was either mutated during rematerialization... Not proved by transporter records. ..or these aren't the remains of the Ambassador. The only abnormality was a temporary increase in the matter-to-energy signal ratio. I investigated the possibility that a second transporter signal caused the fluctuation. Although unlikely, it was the only remaining theory. A second signal? From where? The Devoras. Romulan transporters operate on a frequency like ours. With minor adjustments, they can simulate our carrier wave. Are you saying they beamed the Ambassador off our own pad? While simultaneously, an amount of genetically similar material was left in the Ambassador's place. To make us believe she died in a malfunction. Yes, sir. Mr. Worf, where is the Devoras now? The ship is still in the Neutral Zone on course 079, mark 125. Speed, warp two. Heading for home. The safest decision is to contact Starfleet and await instructions. However, based on experience, I project only a 17-percent chance Capt Picard will choose that alternative. Red alert. All hands, stand to battle stations. Lay in an intercept course. Load torpedoes. Stand by phasers. Warp factor eight. Engage. Open a channel to the Devoras. Aye, sir. No response. The Devoras is dropping out of warp. Weapons powering up. Impulse power. Aye, sir. Message coming in. On screen. Captain, you agreed to leave the Neutral Zone... Admiral, you have taken our Ambassador captive. I assure you there is no one being held captive aboard this ship. We know about the transporter malfunction, and that you are holding Ambassador T'Pel. Romulan war bird decloaking to starboard. I suggest you leave. Now. It is my responsibility to protect the lives of Federation citizens. I will not permit this abduction to succeed. You will not start an incident. I will take whatever action is necessary to obtain the return of the Ambassador. In poker, there is a moment when a player must decide if an opponent is being deceptive or holds a winning hand. This decision is based both on the odds and on an appraisal of the man. Is he bluffing, or does he have the cards? Fortunately, I am not ready to start a war... today. T'Pel. Sub-Cmdr Selok, actually. A spy. A patriot, Captain. She has performed her service to the Empire with distinction. Thank you for your help, Captain. You see that we are not holding one of your citizens. We thank you for returning our sister to us. But my patience has limits. The game is over. I expect you to leave peacefully. Now. Captain. Sensors detect three Romulan war birds entering this sector. Some days, you get the bear. Some days, the bear gets you. Reverse course. Take us back into Federation territory, warp six. Engage. Keiko, I need your help. I have offended you and need to rectify my mistake. I am not sure what to do. You haven't offended me. I interfered. It would be best if I apologized. It would be best if you got dressed. For the wedding? But... Come here! I have the most beautiful carnation for the father of the bride. Now, don't be nervous. I am not nervous. I am confused. Since the days of the first wooden sailing ships, all captains have enjoyed the happy privilege of joining together two people in the bonds of matrimony. And so it is my honour to unite you, Keiko Ishikawa, and you, Miles Edward O'Brien, together in matrimony... There are still many emotions I do not fully comprehend. Anger, hatred, revenge. But I am not mystified by the desire to be loved or the need for friendship. These things I do understand. Congratulations. I was looking for Dr Crusher... The Juarez child? A boy. At the time that we were facing destruction, this small miracle was taking place. Welcome aboard. All systems normal, sir. We are on course for Adelphous IV. Engineering is realigning the deflector dish. Sickbay reports Lt Umbato broke two ribs during a holodeck exercise. Sensors are gathering information on the Murasaki quasar. Very well. I have the bridge. Aye, sir. If being human is not simply a matter of being flesh and blood, if it is instead a way of thinking, acting and feeling, then I am hopeful that maybe one day, I will discover my own humanity. Begin night watch. Until then, Cmdr Maddox, I will continue learning, changing, growing, and trying to become more than what I am. "
S4E12,"Captain's log, star date 44429.6. We're on a mapping survey near the Cardassian Sector. It is nearly a year since a treaty ended the long conflict between the Federation and Cardassia. Captain, we are nearing the periphery of Sector 21503. Look out for a Cardassian ship, Mr. Worf. They should hail us soon. They're still skittish about protecting their border. Last time I was here, I was on the Stargazer, running ahead of a Cardassian warship. Running, Captain? You? That's hard to believe. Believe it. I'd been sent to broker a truce. I'd lowered my shields as a gesture of goodwill. The Cardassians were not impressed. They had taken out most of my weapons before I could regroup and run. The Cardassians have no honour. I do not trust them. They're our allies now. We have to trust them. Trust is earned, not given away. I hope they make contact soon. It's not good to stay too long on a Cardassian border without making your intentions known. What is it? Kelp buds, plankton loaf and sea berries. Sweetheart, I'm not a fish. It's very healthy. I had this when I was growing up. What? No muffins or oatmeal or corned beef and eggs? For breakfast? Keiko, I've been thinking. You've introduced me to this wonderful food that you're used to, I'd like to do the same. Isn't that what marriage is about, sharing? What kind of foods? Scalloped potatoes, mutton shanks, oxtails and cabbage. Kind of heavy. You'll love it, I promise. I remember the aromas when my mother was cooking. She cooked? She didn't believe in a replicator. She thought real food was better. She handled real meat? She touched it and cut it? Yeah, like a master chef. She was fantastic. Of course, I'll have to use the replicator. I'll make something special tonight. You'll love it, I promise. OK. Maybe I'll have something special for you tonight, too. Something's wrong. Red alert. Take emergency stations. Cardassian ship preparing to fire again. Increase power to the forward shields. Hail them again. What is he doing? Damage report. Minor damage to secondary hull before we put up our shields. No casualties. Structural integrity intact. Engineering to bridge. Starboard power coupling is down. Evasive action, delta sequence. Ready phasers. Delta evasion plan initiated. Target engines and shields. Aye, sir. Ready. Fire. Direct hit, sir. Damage to aft shield generators. Continue phaser fire. Multiple hits, sir. Power failure in their forward shields. The Cardassian ship is standing down. Let's see if they'll answer our hail now. Frequency open. This is Capt Picard of the Federation ship Enterprise. I am Gul Macet of the Cardassian ship Trager. Why have you fired on us? Curious question, Captain. In war, one attacks one's enemies. There is a treaty between our peoples. Perhaps that fact was unknown to the Federation starship which destroyed our space station in the Cuellar system two days ago. Federation starship? Attacked an unarmed science station. They had barely enough time to send an emergency signal before they were incinerated. Gul Macet, the Federation and the Cardassians have struggled too hard for peace to abandon it so easily. We are not the ones who have abandoned it, Captain. Let me talk to my superiors, find out what is behind this. Give me one hour. The alternative is for us to continue firing at one another. And in such a contest, you would be at a disadvantage. Very well. One hour. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain, we've confirmed your report. It was the Starship Phoenix, under the command of Benjamin Maxwell. Ben Maxwell? But he's one of Starfleet's finest captains. He must have had provocation. I wish we knew. He's gone on silent running. Won't answer our communiqués. He's still in Cardassian space? The station he destroyed was in Sector 21505. You're the nearest starship. We want you to go in and find him. Will the Cardassians cooperate? They've granted you safe passage. You'll take along a delegation of observers to show good faith. Jean-Luc, I don't have to tell you, the Federation is not prepared for a new sustained conflict. You must preserve the peace. No matter what the cost. Haden out. There will be three Cardassians transporting aboard. Capt Gul Macet and two aides. My intention is to be open with them, allow them to share in our search for the Phoenix. It is necessary to assign them a security detail. They're guests. I don't want them to feel like prisoners. I agree with Mr. Worf. They don't need to have the run of the ship. Allow me to post guards in some of the sensitive areas of the ship. Very well. Let's limit their access. But you instruct your people they are our guests. Aye, sir. Counsellor, stay close to the crew. Some may feel uncomfortable with Cardassians on board. I don't want any incidents. Yes, Captain. Mr. Data, has anyone else on board served with Capt Benjamin Maxwell? Accessing. Chief O'Brien served under him aboard the Rutledge, sir. Indeed. Number One, will you and the Counsellor meet our guests? Inform Chief O'Brien I will be calling on him. Yes, sir. Welcome to the Enterprise. I'm First Officer William Riker. Counsellor Deanna Troi. I am Gul Macet. My aides, Glinn Daro, Glinn Telle. This is our transporter chief, Mr. O'Brien. Shall we? Captain's log, supplemental. We have entered Cardassian territory on our quest to locate the Phoenix. With our sensors we've been scanning a radius of ten light years. We can effectively scan one sector a day. We're scanning 21505 now. There's no sign of the Phoenix. In fact, you have no assurance the ship is still in Sector 21505. In fact, we have no idea where it is. We thought the last known coordinates were a good place to start. Capt Picard, you can understand that we are skeptical. Do you expect us to believe that you are using every means at your disposal to track down one of your own? Of course you are concerned, Gul Macet. That is precisely why I have included you in every aspect of our effort. You're present with my staff. You're hearing reports as I hear them, nothing edited or withheld. Very well. Transporter Chief O'Brien served with Benjamin Maxwell. I thought he might be able to provide some insights. Mr. O'Brien, I understand that Capt Maxwell lost his family during a raid on an outpost. More like sabotage, sir. It was on Setlik III. Cardassian militia made a sneak raid on an outpost, wiped out close to 100 civilians. Then it's revenge he's after. That's not what I meant. It's retribution for his own loss. Capt Maxwell... Gentlemen. Let's not indulge in speculation. Can we confine our discussion to the facts? Mr. O'Brien... Worf to Capt Picard. Go ahead. Sensors have located the Phoenix. Gul Macet, will you join me on the bridge? Deck six. Deck ten. Your captain is most impressive. Yes, he is. Chief O'Brien, our transporting system is still operating with active feed-pattern buffers. I would like to talk with you about your technology. I'll have to get Cmdr La Forge's approval. I understand. In the meantime, we are going to your ten-forward. Will you join us? If my Commander tells me to discuss the transporter with you, I will. If Capt Picard orders me to tell you about Ben Maxwell, I will. But who I choose to spend my free time with, that's my business. Captain, the Phoenix is in Sector 21505. Ensign, set a course, warp six. Mr. Worf, send a message. Tell them to prepare for a rendezvous. Yes, Captain. Captain, a suggestion. Yes? We have a number of ships in Sector 21505. If you will give us more precise coordinates and the ship's coded transponder frequency, we could intercept Maxwell far more quickly than you. I'm sure that's true. However, given the circumstances, I would prefer to make the initial contact myself. You would, if the situation were reversed. Captain, time is crucial. You have a dangerous man with a huge arsenal at his command. If he is intent on revenge against my people, he must be stopped before he can do more damage. So far, we have an isolated incident. If I reach him first, then perhaps diplomacy can prevail. But if one of your ships should decide to retaliate, we could lose control of the situation. You will not give us the means to find his precise location? No, I won't. There you are. Potato casserole. A dish fit for kings. The minstrel boy to the war has gone What's that you're singing? What? It's just an old song. A bunch of us used to sing it on the Rutledge. I hadn't thought about it in years. What's it about? It's about war and glory. The minstrel boy to the war has gone In the ranks of death you will find him His father's sword he hath girded on And his wild harp slung behind him Capt Maxwell always liked that song. All this business about him and the Cardassians brought it back. You know, sitting with the staff this morning, I could tell there were people who still don't like the Cardassians. I imagine that's to be expected. You do? Sure. It was a long war. That takes its toll. What are these dark things? Capers. But the fighting's over now. Why should anyone still feel however they feel? You fought the Cardassians? There were some skirmishes, when I was with Capt Maxwell. Well, how do you feel about them? Me? I feel fine. I mean, the war's over now. The pursuing ship is the Phoenix. And the other? A Cardassian supply ship. How would you know that? We are able to make that determination. You can read our transponder codes. The important thing now is your ship may be in jeopardy. Mr. Worf, any answer to our message? No, Captain. Put out a repeating message, priority-one communiqué. Break off your pursuit now. Aye, sir. We are doing everything we can to reach them. Yes, and accomplishing nothing, I'm sorry to say. Can you show me the location of our other ships? Mr. Data. There, you see? We have a warship which could intercept the Phoenix, if you will give us the transponder frequency. Or are you going to stand there while our ship is destroyed, Captain? Mr. Worf, has there been any response to our hails? No, Captain. Very well. Mr. Worf,... ..relay the prefix codes of the Phoenix to the Cardassian warship. Sir, they will be able to dismantle its shields! The Phoenix won't have a chance! I cannot allow Maxwell to ambush that supply ship. Mr. Worf, now. Yes, Captain. The Cardassian warship is moving on the Phoenix. Mr. Data, overlay weapon ranges of the two ships. The warship is 300,000 kilometres from the Phoenix. It is opening fire. The Phoenix has taken a direct hit. The Phoenix has begun evasive manoeuvres. It has positioned itself outside the range of the opposing ship. The Phoenix has powered up both phasers and photon torpedoes. The Phoenix is firing photon torpedoes. He has destroyed our warship. Does the supply ship have any weapons? Very limited. Not enough to defeat a Nebula-class starship. Sir, the Phoenix is firing on the... The warship carried a crew of 600, the supply ship, 50. Estimate the time to intercept with the Phoenix. At our present speed of warp four, 16 hours 44 minutes. Ensign, increase to warp nine. Captain. Chief. I wanted to talk to you. Anything I can do, sir. Ben Maxwell, he must be quite a man. He's a rare one, alright. I count myself lucky, sir. I've served with the two finest captains in Starfleet. From your knowledge of the man, what has gone wrong? There's a reason for what he's doing. The Cardassians were up to something, I'm sure. When his family was killed, how did he take it? I'd say he took it well. I know he was broken up inside. Who wouldn't be? But you'd never know it to see him. He never missed a minute's duty. Always had a smile, a joke. I see. He would never retaliate, no matter what that Cardassian says. They're up to something, sir. They're the ones you should investigate, not Maxwell. You don't care for the Cardassians? I like them fine. It's just, well, I know them. You learn to watch your back when you're around those people. Ben Maxwell has just sent more than 600 of them to their deaths. I don't know what to say, sir. But he must have had his reasons. I think when one has been angry for a long time, one gets used to it. And it becomes comfortable, like old leather. And, finally,... ..it becomes so familiar one can't ever remember feeling any other way. Thank you, Chief. Kanar. Mind if I join you? Do you want another? And an ale. Kanar. I never could develop a taste for it. It takes a bit of getting used to. I wanted to say, I owe you an apology. I shouldn't have popped off like that in the turbolift. I think... Here's your ale, Mr. O'Brien. This has been hard on all of us. I know I'll be happy when I'm back on my own ship. I guess that's true. I hadn't thought about that. I was on Setlik III with Capt Maxwell the morning after the massacre. We were too late, of course. Almost everyone was dead. That was a terrible mistake. We were told the outpost was a launching place for a massive attack against us. The only people left alive were in an outlying district of the settlement. I was sent there with a squad to reinforce them. Cardassians were advancing on us, moving through the streets, destroying, killing. I was with a group of women and children, when two Cardassian soldiers burst in. I stunned one of them. The other one jumped me. We struggled. One of the women threw me a phaser, and I fired. The phaser was set at maximum. The man just, just incinerated, there before my eyes. I'd never killed anything before. When I was a kid, I'd worry about swatting a mosquito. It's not you I hate, Cardassian. I hate what I became because of you. I will protest this, Klingon! Lieutenant? He was found at a computer station, attempting to access information on our weapon systems. A lie, Gul Macet. I was studying the terminal interface systems. They're more efficient than ours. I didn't know what was in the files. What business did you have going near one of their computers? But, Gul Macet, I meant nothing. There was no harm done. Go to your quarters. You're confined there for the duration of this expedition. As you wish, sir. Mr. Worf, please accompany him. Gladly, Captain. Captain, may we speak in private? You have the bridge, Number One. I deeply regret what my aide has done, Captain. You have my word, he will be disciplined upon my return. You may take what action you wish. I consider the matter closed. I'm not sure I would be so generous in your place, Captain. Thank you. If there is to be a lasting peace, neither you nor I must allow any one man to undermine our efforts. There are those who crave war, who need it. I am not one of them, Captain. And I'm beginning to see that neither are you. We have had our full measure. The lasting peace begins here, with the two of us. Bridge to Captain. Picard here. We have located the Phoenix. We will intercept it in 22 minutes. Captain's log, star date 44431. 7. We have contacted Capt Maxwell and he has agreed to come on board. Welcome aboard, sir. I'm Cmdr Riker, First Officer. I know all about you, Commander. Fine work you did with the Borg. We all owe you on that one. Thank you. O'Brien? Miles O'Brien? Hello, Captain. Good to see you. How are ya? I had no idea you were on the Enterprise. This was my tactical officer on the Rutledge. Best I ever had. Thank you. O'Brien has the ability to size up a situation instantly, then come up with options to fit all contingencies. Remarkable. I learned that from you. But you got that silver tongue by kissing the Stone. Commander, best I see your captain straightaway. We've got a lot to talk about. Yes, sir. Capt Jean-Luc Picard. Capt Benjamin Maxwell. That'll be all, Commander. Captain. A pleasure, Captain. Please, sit down. You must think I've gone mad. The thought had occurred. Picard, I have to tell you, I was grateful when I realised it was you Starfleet had sent after me. Someone who knows what it's like out here. I know of nothing out here that could justify what you have done. Then listen to this. The Cardassians are arming again. That so-called science station? Military supply port. How do you know this? Information comes my way. From whom? Where is your documentation? I know what they're doing! I can smell it. There's no reason for a science station in the Cuellar system, but it's a hell of a strategic site for a military transport station, a jumping-off point into three Federation sectors. They're running supply ships, and nobody can tell me it's for scientific research. Whatever the circumstances, why didn't you notify Starfleet? And wait six months while the bureaucrats read reports, trying to figure out what to do? They don't know what's going on out here. But you should, Picard. You know what it's like to be under fire. You weren't under fire. Lives were at stake. Whose lives? We had to act now! Why? It smells musty in here. Like a bureaucrat's office. You have killed nearly 700 people and taken us to the brink of war. I have prevented war. Or at the very least delayed it a good long time. The peace treaty was a ruse to give them time to regroup. Alone, you decided to dispose of the treaty. I took the initiative. I did what had to be done. What had to be done? For whom? Why would a man, with a long and brilliant service, abandon the principles that he has believed in, even fought for, all of his life? I believe it is because of what they did to your wife and your children. Not true. To avenge their deaths. You're a fool, Picard. History will look at you and say, ""This man was a fool."" I'll accept the judgement of history. When it becomes clear what the Cardassians have done, I will be vindicated. What they have or have not done is irrelevant. Irrelevant? Come with me. Find one of their supply ships, and we'll see how irrelevant it is. We're not going after any more Cardassian ships. You're going to return to your bridge... ..and set a course for Star base 211. The Phoenix and the Enterprise will return to Federation space. Those are Starfleet's orders. I will permit you the dignity of retaining your command during the voyage. The alternative is to put you in the brig and to tow your ship back to the star base in disgrace. I will return to my ship. You understand your orders? Yes, Captain. Mr. Worf, report to my ready room. My guest is departing. Aye, sir. Captain's log, supplemental. With the Phoenix in close formation, we are proceeding to Star base 211. Mr. Data, how long until we clear Cardassian space? At this speed, three hours, 20 minutes. Mr. Worf, send a message to Admiral Haden. Inform him of our time of arrival. Aye, sir. Captain, the Phoenix has changed course. What is he doing? Ensign, change course to pursue. Mr. Worf, will you hail Capt Maxwell? No response, Captain. Data, project his new course. He is headed for a Cardassian vessel, 0.12 light years from here. He'll attack that ship just as he did the others. Continue the hail, Mr. Worf. Priority-one message. Do you know what that ship is? I imagine it's a supply ship, headed for the research station in the Kelrabi system. The Phoenix still does not respond. Ensign, warp eight. Overtake. The Phoenix has accelerated to warp nine. We will not be able to reach him before he gets to the vessel. Ensign, warp nine. Aye, sir. Arm phasers. Continue the hail. Aye, sir. Chief O'Brien was Maxwell's tactical officer. Get him up here. The Phoenix is out of warp. They have reached the vessel. Slow to impulse. Vessels are within visual range. On screen. Has the Phoenix activated its weapons? Negative. Phaser banks are not armed. The Cardassians? Sensors are unable to determine the status of their defences. Their ship is running with a high-powered subspace field. Mr. O'Brien, your former commander is placing me in the position of firing on him. I need your knowledge of the man, how he thinks, what he's capable of doing. Aye, sir. Sir, Capt Maxwell is hailing us. On screen. Alright, Picard. You need proof? You've got it now. Capt Maxwell, you have disobeyed a direct order. Board the ship. You'll see that everything I've said is true. The Cardassian vessel will not be boarded. You will transport aboard the Enterprise. Picard, if you don't board that ship, I'll destroy it. And I will use whatever force is necessary to prevent you from taking that action, Captain. Sir, Capt Maxwell, if he feels his back is against the wall, he'll strike. The Phoenix is transferring power to its shields. They're arming phasers and loading torpedo bays. Red alert. It seems you were right, Mr. O'Brien. Ready phasers, load torpedoes. Phasers armed. Loading torpedo bays. Sir, let me beam over. Try to talk to him. We served together a long time. When you've been through what we have, you get inside someone. He might listen. He'd never allow you to transport on board. The Phoenix is using a high-energy sensor system. It cycles every 5.5 minutes. Between, there's a window of a 50th of a second. Trust me, I can get through. Make it so. Not now! I'm not armed. How the devil did you get here? I thought that if we could talk, we could figure a way out of this mess. The way out of this is clear. Talk to Picard. Get him to board the damn ship! He won't do that, sir. But he'd turn his weapons on this ship to protect the enemy? I don't believe it. He will! Count on it. What the hell has happened to this war? Sir, there is no war. The war is over. You're wrong. The Cardassians live to make war. That's what everybody thinks about the enemy. That's what they think about us. We're not the same at all. We do not start wars! We do not make surprise attacks on manned outposts! We do not butcher women and children in their homes! Children... ..who never had the chance to grow up! You were with me on Setlik. You saw what they did. Yes, sir. What was the name of that fella who hung around you like a puppy? Will Kayden. Stompie. Stompie! As cool under fire as a mountain lake. Yes, sir. He died at Setlik, didn't he? Yes, sir. What was that song of his? The one he always sang, the one I liked? The minstrel boy to the war has gone In the ranks of death you will find him His father's sword he hath girded on And his wild harp slung behind him ""Land of song!"" said the warrior bard Though all the world betrays thee One sword at least thy rights shall guard One faithful harp shall praise thee I'm not gonna win this one, am l, Chief? No, sir. Captain's log, supplemental. Capt Maxwell has turned his ship over and transported to the Enterprise. I have confined him to quarters for the return voyage. Thank you, Chief. I'd just like to say, sir, he was a good man. What he did was terribly wrong, I know that now, but I'm still proud to have served with him. Thank you, Chief. And well done. That'll be all. His loyalty is admirable, even if it is misplaced. The loyalty you would quickly dismiss does not come easily to my people. You have much to learn about us. Benjamin Maxwell earned the loyalty of those who served with him. You know, in war, he was twice honoured with the Federation's highest citation for courage and valour. And if he could not find a role for himself in peace, we can pity him, but we shall not dismiss him. You are welcome to your opinion. I, for one, am grateful he is under lock and key. One more thing, Gul Macet. Maxwell was right. Those ships were not carrying scientific equipment, were they? A research station within arm's reach of three Federation sectors? Cargo ships running with high-energy subspace fields that jam sensors? If you believe the transport ship was carrying weapons, Captain, why didn't you board it as Maxwell requested? I was here to protect the peace. A peace I firmly believe is in the interest of both our peoples. If I had attempted to board that ship, I'm certain you and I would not be having this pleasant conversation, and that ships on both sides would now be arming for war. Captain, I assure you... Take this message to your leaders, Gul Macet. We'll be watching. "
S4E13,"You don't believe in me! I don't. What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses? I don't know. Why do you doubt your senses? Because... a little thing affects them. A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be a bit of undigested beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. Why, there's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are. Humbug, I tell you. Humbug. Freeze program. Very well done, Data! Your performance skills really are improving. Your courtesy is appreciated, sir. But I do not effectively convey the fear called for in the story. Well, you've never known fear, Data. But as an acute observer of behaviour you should be able to approximate it. Sir, that is not an appropriate basis for an effective performance. Not by the standards set by my mentors. Your mentors? Yes, sir. I have studied the philosophies of virtually every acting master. I find myself attracted to Stanislavsky, Adler, Garnov: proponents of an acting technique known as the Method. Method acting? I'm vaguely familiar with it, but why choose such an old-fashioned approach? Perhaps because it requires an actor to seek his own emotional awareness, to understand the character. But surely that's an impossible task for you, Data. I have modified the Method for my own uses. Since I have no emotional awareness to create a performance, I am attempting to use performance to create emotional awareness. If I can learn to duplicate the fear of Ebenezer Scrooge, I will be one step closer to truly understanding humanity. Capt Picard, please report to the bridge. On my way, Number One. Data, the moment you decided to stop imitating other actors and create your own interpretation, you were already one step closer to understanding humanity. We had an emergency signal from the science station on Ventax II. What's the emergency? Uncertain. It was interrupted. Contact re-established, sir. On screen. I am Dr Howard Clark, Director of the science station. Thank you for responding. Mr. Worf, can you improve reception? The trouble is at the source, sir. Dr Clark, we are barely able to maintain communication. Can you boost your power source? I'm afraid not. It's under attack. Under attack? There's a mob outside trying to break in. The planet is in chaos. Lootings, fires, mass hysteria. These people are convinced their world is coming to an end. Tomorrow. Please, we must have your immediate... Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, star date 44474.5. Now at Ventax II, we are attempting to contact the science station, which at last report was under siege by an angry mob. They are transmitting again. On screen, before we lose contact. Enterprise! Do you read me? Emergency! We need help. Dr Clark, we are ready to beam you and your team on board... They're in! Lock on to the science team, beam them aboard. I've locked on to Dr Clark. I can't pick out the others. It's a mess down there. Then beam Dr Clark aboard by himself. Mr. Worf, escort him to my ready room. Aye, sir. Number One. Try and make some sense out of this mess. The people in Ventax Il live in an agrarian society. At least, they do now. What do you mean, now? A good anthropological question, one we were studying before the... ..trouble began. In the distant past, the Ventaxian culture had achieved an extremely advanced scientific level, but a millennium ago they turned their backs on technology. They reverted to a simpler life? And remained that way for centuries. The first contact was made by a Klingon expedition 70 years ago. Since then, new technology has been available. They simply are not interested. Virtually no social problems to be found on this planet... I would have described their society as idyllic until... Until what, Doctor? It's hard to believe. Several years ago, Acost Jared, the Ventaxian Head of State, grew increasingly obsessed with the legend of Ardra. Each day he grew more anxious. He'd talk about little else. ""Ardra is coming back."" ""Ardra will be here soon."" ""We must all leave before Ardra returns."" And... who is this Ardra? For all intents and purposes,... ..the devil. These people actually believe they've sold their souls to the devil. Riker to Capt Picard. Have you located the science team? They're being held hostage. Hostage? There's a Ventaxian leader on the view screen, name of Acost Jared. Doctor. Jared, you must secure the release of my people. How can you allow this? Howard, my friend, you know how I abhor all acts of violence, but events are out of my control. I'm Capt Picard. Is there nothing you can do? As the hour of Ardra's return approaches, fear grips my people. It has been 1,000 years. The prophecies have come true! Prophecies? Ardra's arrival is said to be heralded by the shaking of cities. There has been a series of geological tremors on the planet. Minor quakes. Nothing extraordinary. Poorly timed. There is more. For several nights there have been visions of Ardra, just as the contract said would occur before her return. Visions? You mean dreams? No. She has appeared. I myself have seen her. Jared, tell your people if the hostages are released, I am prepared to offer Federation assistance should this... this ""Ardra"" return. I'm afraid it will not matter. They know your weapons are useless against her, Captain. I will make enquiries about the hostages. The innocent should not suffer for our sins. But I can make no promises. This situation is deteriorating. People are reaching anxiety levels that could lead to suicide. Mr. Data, what do we know about this Ardra? She is a cornerstone of Ventaxian theology. It seems Ardra came to Ventax Il and promised 1,000 years of peace and prosperity for a price: upon her return, she would enslave the entire population. Ventaxians consider it bad luck to speak her name out loud. There are ancient scrolls concerning Ardra stored in the Atheneum vaults. Scholars study them. They've been of little public interest until recently. I should meet Jared. He's our best hope for release of the hostages. I'll have him transported on board. No. I'm going down there myself. You risk being taken as an additional hostage. Mr. Worf, you and Data will accompany me. Mr. O'Brien can keep a lock on us. He can pull us out if necessary. Yes, sir. Counsellor, I want you to come too. Captain, you shouldn't have come. Your life is in danger here. Calm your people. There is no reason for panic. No reason? If these tremors have led to this hysteria over Ardra, let us reassure them. We have scanned the stress patterns of your planet's crust. The quakes do not pose any kind of threat. No, no, no, the threat is from Ardra! You cannot understand. If you can at least help us to locate our people. She is here. Nonsense. It is only... Time's up. I'm disappointed. I expected my tenants to take better care of my property. Ardra, most powerful one, I am Jared, leader of Ventax ll. I take responsibility for all that displeases you. Please, do not punish my people. Punish? Who said anything about punishing? I merely expect your end of our contract to be upheld. Thank you. Don't talk like some ancient prophet: ""thee"", ""thou"", ""most powerful one"". It was appealing for a few centuries but I bore easily. And stop cowering. When I want you on your knees, I'll let you know. Much better. A fine example for the others. Who would you be? Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise. Keep up the good work. First, we'll need an accounting of all you've accumulated for me. This form will give guidelines for a full census of the population, with emphasis on productivity and economic forecasts. Who are you? My, you are forceful, aren't you? Good. I like my men forceful. At least at the start. You're not managing to intimidate me. That's alright. I like a challenge. A planet has been terrorized because of the suggestion that you're going to enslave the population. Well, it's true. Of course I wouldn't put it so melodramatically. It's just a standard contract with an unusually long term. So you purport to be the mythic figure Ardra? I have many names, my pale friend. I am Mendora in the Berussian cluster, Torak to the Drellians. The Klingons call me Fek'lhr. You are not Fek'lhr! Ah, but I am. I am the guardian of Gre'thor, where the dishonoured go when they die. But here on Ventax Il I am called Ardra. I negotiated a contract with these people ten centuries ago today. Oh, you doubt me. A non-believer. Really, Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise! No doubt you have travelled the galaxy, encountered a diverse universe of creatures. Is there no room for the likes of me? I've met many more credibly called the devil than you. The devil! Now, there's one I haven't heard in a long time. You claim you visited here 1,000 years ago and negotiated a contract? That's correct. I would like to see that contract. The scrolls of Ardra, Captain. A long-winded description of a simple business arrangement. I did away with their wars, famine and economic ruin and provided 1,000 years of paradise. My terms were clearly stated. They went into this with their eyes open. You'll find everything is in order. You won't mind if I don't take your word for it. Jared, with your permission, I'd like Mr. Data to review these. It is no longer my decision, Captain. I have intrigued you, haven't l, Picard? I am only here to secure the release of the hostages. Hostages? Is this true? Yes. Panic gripped the people as the time of your return drew near. Yes, I do have that effect on people. See that the hostages are released. Now. Immediately. Let us not cloud this with bit players, Picard. You will not leave because you find me irresistible. Advise Dr Clark the hostages are being released. This is Clark. You did it! Thank goodness. Goodness had nothing to do with it. Three to beam up. Mr. Data will remain on the planet surface. I want a complete report on the contents of these documents. I refuse to abandon this planet to that woman. Energize. Could she be another refugee from the Q continuum? For that matter, could she be Q? Q wouldn't bother with contracts. Or economic forecasts. I noticed that, too. I had the impression of being in the presence of a... a flim-flam artist. But her powers? Her powers are, at the best, unclear. Think about it. Transporters can make things appear and disappear. The illusion that she can transform into a Klingon creature could be created by holographic projection. And creating a minor tremor could be the result of a tractor beam projected onto the tectonic plates. We could recreate all of these events. She just dresses them up and delivers them with dramatic flair. Like a magician. Exactly. She has a very focused mind. It was virtually impossible to sense any deception. Or anything else. Magicians will never let you see what's up their sleeve. She must be tapping into some power source to produce those effects. Number One, I want you and Mr. Worf to run scans of this star system. Look for a ship, a base of operations, anything that could generate that power. Mr. La Forge, accompany Dr Clark back. Trace the origin of these tremors. Your chair offers a lovely view of my planet. Come, sit with me. Either leave my bridge or I will remove you by force. By force? You disappoint me. You didn't strike me as that sort. But by all means... try. Mr. Worf. I was really hoping you'd try it yourself. Transporter room three, lock on to the intruder and transport her to the planet surface. Aye, sir. Ensign, put up the shields until further notice. Yes, sir. Whatever you say. We are not impressed by your magic. I pity you. We live in a universe of magic, which evidently you cannot see. My pale friend. Have you finished examining the contract? I have, sir. Report. The contract agrees to deliver the people of Ventax Il into the personal servitude of Ardra after 1,000 years of peace. I have compared it to the laws governing the planet. The language is correct in every detail. Such speed and accuracy. You're much too talented to be human. I am an android. Android! Of course. How wonderful. An unexpected bonus. Bonus? Yes. When the contract came to term, I gained clear title to the planet. Anything on the surface, in the air or... in orbit. So you see, the Enterprise belongs to me now as well. The contract could be interpreted in that way, sir. Captain's log, supplemental. Although I consider this woman's claim upon my ship an empty threat, it has inspired my determination to expose her for the fraud she is. Come. You wished to see me, sir. Yes, Mr. Data. A wise man once said, ""There is a sucker born every minute."" Barnum, sir. PT. I've been examining the dynamics of what used to be called the con game. Quite fascinating. Worthy of your study, Data. Sir, do you believe Ardra is, to use the vernacular, a con artist? Yes, I do, Data. And I believe it is our job to out-con the con artist. Sir, I must point out that the Ventaxians did have 1,000 years of peace and tranquillity as promised by Ardra. We can only speculate what happened 1,000 years ago. Maybe a Ventaxian leader saw the destruction of his society at hand and conceived this ""contract of Ardra"" to motivate change. Or maybe there was an Ardra who is the basis for this mythology. Who knows? The point is that somehow a fundamental theology was created which transformed this society, but, in the process of change, created this latent fear which has been passed down through generations. Data, from your own experience of performing Ebenezer Scrooge, you're aware of how fear can be a powerful motivator. Indeed, sir. The spirits used fear to motivate Scrooge to reform his character. And in the hands of a con artist fear can be used to motivate obedience, capitulation, the exploitation of innocent people. That is what I believe has happened here and I intend to prove that. I need to find a loophole, some way of challenging the validity of this contract. The language of the contract seems chosen to avoid any loopholes. Check it again, and every Ventaxian legal precedent for the last 1,000 years. We'll talk in the morning. Aye, sir. Picard to bridge. Intruder alert. Picard to bridge. I've arranged for a bit of privacy. Just the two of us. This is becoming very tiresome. Oh, come now, Picard. You know you find me tantalizing. Give in to your desires. You know, there's nothing about you I find tantalizing. On the contrary, I find you obvious and vulgar. Easily fixed. I can be your ideal woman, Picard. Prim and proper. And chaste, until I succumb to your charms. Or do your fantasies turn toward a professional woman, one, perhaps, who wears a Starfleet uniform? Perhaps I could even be... Someone close at hand, yet unattainable. I can do anything for you, Captain. Anything you could ever imagine. A night that would light fire in your dreams until you die, and you would reject me? Oh, yes. You shall regret that. I think not. Oh, but you will. Capt Picard? Captain, I wasn't expecting you here. Neither was l. La Forge to Enterprise. Go ahead. Worf, Capt Picard is here. You'd better transport him back. The Captain? But l... It's alright. Ardra somehow transported me here. Will you beam me to my quarters? Aye, sir. We're locked on to you. Transporter is malfunctioning. Some sort of interference. Checking. Just have Data fetch me in a shuttle. And have him bring along a uniform. Did you say uniform? Yes, I did! Aye, sir. Mr. La Forge and Dr Clark have made no headway. Cmdr Riker and Lt Worf have picked nothing up on their scans. I have found a precedent in Ventaxian law which may be of interest. Yes? It involves a contract dispute over services rendered by a Klingon craftsman on the construction of a Ventaxian home. Because the dispute involved an alien culture, the parties decided that arbitration, not the courts, should resolve it. Both sides chose an arbitrator. It is the only known case involving an alien claimant. That's exactly what I needed. Well done. Shuttlecraft One to Enterprise. Prepare for docking sequence. Proceed, Shuttle One. Enterprise. Enterprise, do you read me? Enterprise, come in! I cannot locate the ship anywhere within one light year of the planet. I don't believe Ardra can transport it a light year away. Keep hailing them. Repeat on all frequencies. Hey, I think we've found something here. There's a jump in Z-particles just at the time the Enterprise disappeared. Where? It was too brief to pinpoint. But it could suggest a hidden power source. We need to find that source if we are to defeat this woman. If you can get her to perform a few more magic tricks, we might be able to track it down. I trust you have a bit more respect for me now. What have you done to my ship? I've done nothing with your ship. My ship is safely in my possession. I do not recognize your claim on the Enterprise. Nor on this world, for that matter. In accordance with Ventaxian legal precedent, I call for an arbitration. An arbitration? There's nothing to arbitrate. Oh, but there is. You're a fraud. I intend to prove you could not have effected the changes on this planet. Do you not believe your own eyes? Your ship is gone, Captain. An illusion. Magicians have been making things disappear for ages. You underestimate me. But then, most people do, until it's too late. If you are who you say you are, you have nothing to lose. And nothing to gain. I already have possession of this planet and your ship. I am prepared to offer an added incentive if you win. A trip to the ruins of Ligillium. The Zaterl emerald? You know where it is? Yes, I do. You are too clever, Captain. But I have enough jewels. If you wish this foolish arbitration, I will choose my own prize. And what would that be? You. By all rights your body is already mine, but I want more. I want your heart, your mind, your soul, and I want you to give them without resistance, of your own free will. So, do you still wish to pursue this most dangerous game? I agree to your terms. Oh, Picard, I will enjoy you morning, noon and night! But we must agree to an arbitrator. Very well. I choose Mr. Data. Any objections? Mr. Data is a member of my crew. Of my crew. And he's an android. He is incapable of deceit or bias. He has no feelings to get in the way of his judgement. Ardra, before he responds, may I have a word in private with Capt Picard? Sir, I request you reject me as an arbitrator. Why? Ardra is right. I will perform my duties without bias or sentiment. I cannot guarantee I will deliver a verdict in your favour. Data, where else on this planet can I find someone she cannot intimidate? Sir, I will have to follow the rules of conduct for a Ventaxian jurist. I understand. You'll make a fine judge. 1,000 years ago our planet was dying. Overcrowded city states warred unceasingly with each other. Air and water were polluted with industrial waste. There was a constant threat of starvation and epidemic. Then what happened? And then... you came. Objection. There is no evidence this woman ever visited the planet 1,000 years ago. And I suppose you want a 1,000-year-old witness? That would be acceptable. Jared, does the contract specify how you would know me when I return? Yes, by the date. Anything else? By the shaking of the cities and by the visions. All of these occurred on schedule? Yes. Thank you. Your Honour, I submit that I have established my identity as stated by the contract. Capt Picard, my interpretation of Ventaxian law suggests that under these circumstances this is acceptable. Objection overruled. Your Honour... Sir... I have ruled. Please sit down. You may proceed. Thank you, Your Honour. When I first set foot on Ventax II, what did I offer your people? According to the scrolls, you offered 1,000 years of peace and prosperity if we surrendered to you at the end of the term. And why do you think they would strike such a bargain? We had nothing to lose. There was no hope in sight. Until I came along. Objection! I withdraw the observation. No further questions. Your Honour, nothing in this proves that Ardra had the power to affect the lives of the Ventaxians. My opponent has failed to prove her case and I move that her claim be dismissed. I find no cause to invalidate the contract at this time. The arbitration will continue. Your Honour... Capt Picard, as a new visitor to my planet, has been a consistent doubter of my abilities. I would like to ask him a few questions, if I may. It is highly irregular to question the opposing advocate. But I see no reason to deny it. Proceed. Please do not take any offence. You know how fond I am of you. Objection. Sustained. Refrain from expressing personal affections for your opponent. You do not believe my powers are real? No, I don't. Then, sir, may I ask you to explain... this? You are out of order. Or this? You will refrain from making your opponent disappear. Or this? Can you explain it, Picard? Any more disruptions and I will rule you in contempt of court. Is that understood? I am sorry, Your Honour. But can you explain it, Picard? Yes or no? No. I rest my case, Your Honour. The decay rate of these Z-particles makes it hard to trace the source. I'm correlating their trajectories. They're beginning to align. Wait. I have coordinates! 34 degrees north, 62 degrees east at an altitude of 210 kilometres. That would put it in orbit above the western magnetic pole. Running visual scan. Nothing. This time, I don't buy the magic. Something's gotta be there. Jared, you've described the history of your people before and after Ardra's first visit. But I'm a little unclear about the change itself. Did Ardra simply... snap her fingers and transform the planet into this paradise? No. The changes occurred over a long period of time. Did she form the government that so peacefully ruled this planet? No. Historical records indicate a council was convened to assess our options. They draw up a new constitution, which the population later ratified. I see. So she advised this council? No. No? Then she must have destroyed all your weapons. No, our leaders did that. And they signed a treaty of non-aggression. Well, then, let's move on to the environmental gains. How were they accomplished? We shifted our economy from an industrial to an agrarian base. It was more ecologically sound. But Ardra must have purified the polluted water and air? No, the record shows there were a series of initiatives, covering everything from atmospheric contaminants to waste disposal. Did she not even pick up one piece of trash? Ardra had left Ventax Il before the reforms began. Forgive me, but it sounds as if, with a lot of courage, hard work, your ancestors changed this world all by themselves. Objection. The advocate is drawing conclusions. Sustained. I will draw my own conclusions, if you do not mind. Sir. No further questions. Rebuttal? Just two questions. Is there any doubt in your mind, any doubt at all, that without me the terrible conditions here would have continued? You are under oath. No doubt at all. Then, as former head of state for the Ventaxian people, you agree that I fulfilled my part of the bargain? Yes, Ardra. Thank you. What more can be said? Both sides agree the terms of the contract have been fulfilled. Capt Picard, do you have any further evidence? I believe my associate may be bringing the answer to that. I request a recess. Hi, Data. Geordi. One hour recess is granted. Mr. La Forge, my reputation as a litigator, not to mention my immortal soul, is in jeopardy. Whatever's gone on here gave us what we needed. Have you found their power source? A cloaked ship. She has a Romulan cloaking device? More likely a bad copy of one. We found it on a wavelength scan. The Enterprise? Exactly where it's supposed to be. Ardra extended her cloaking shields around it, set up a damping field. I've isolated the frequency and penetrated it. Can you make contact? Already have. This is what I want to do. But we have less than an hour. You're a wise and experienced leader. I assume you trust your senses. I would say so. And your senses tell you this woman is the most powerful force on Ventax? Yes. Then what would you say if I told you that she has no powers whatsoever? We have seen her powers here. That's right. And you will again. Oh, yes. Ardra's magic! Jared, would you believe me if I said I could steal her powers and perform the same magic acts as she does? I'm sorry, Capt Picard, but you are not Ardra. No, that's true. I'm not Ardra. But I can create tremors, just as she did. Objection! I think he deserves some leeway. Overruled. But that will be enough, Captain. Of course. Ardra, would you stop the tremors? Of course! Is something the matter? I like the tremors. Well, I don't. You recognize the same old bag of tricks? What about this one? Come back, Ardra, if you can. No? Fine. Allow me. Of all the impudence! Impudence? Impudence is pretending to be Fek'lhr of Klingon! Your leeway has run out. Your Honour, I appreciate your indulgence. Allow me to explain. A team from the Enterprise has taken control of this woman's ship, now in orbit around Ventax ll. Thanks for your help, Number One. Glad to be of service, sir. They've been monitoring me, executing a prearranged program on her ship's computer, an ingenious combination of force-field projection, holography and transporter effects. Ardra controls her ""magic"" literally by the blink of an eye. Centuries-old technology. An implant which lets the movements of her eye choose and activate each illusion. Ardra once told us that she is known by many names. At least in that she was honest. Her crew admitted that she is known by 23 aliases in this sector alone. You had no right! Deceiving innocent people with her petty schemes for years. Ventax Il offered her the greatest opportunity of her nefarious career. She learned of the myth of Ardra, studied it, and so expertly played on your fears that your people were ready to virtually surrender to her. Your Honour, under the circumstances, I believe it is only fair that I release the Ventaxians from their obligation. And I will let them keep the peace they have. And I will just be on my way. With the advocate's withdrawal, the contract is dissolved. This arbitration is adjourned. Thank you, Captain. You saved our lives. No. As I've tried to tell you, you saved your own lives a long time ago. Congratulations, sir. Your Honour. You would have had a lot more fun if you'd lost. Till we meet again, Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise. "
S4E14,"Captain's log, star date 44502.7. Early completion of our mission at Harrakis V has allowed me to grant extra personal time for the crew. This has been a relief, since our recent tight scheduling has curtailed the leisure activities that are a normal part of life aboard the Enterprise. Our journey past the Ngame Nebula should be uneventful and am personally using the time to fulfil a promise to a colleague. Dixon Hill around? He's occupied at the present moment. Tell him Gloria is here. Can't do that. He doesn't want to be disturbed. Tell him it's Gloria from... Cleveland. It doesn't matter if you're from the moon, hon'. Mr. Hill is incommuni... incommunica... ca... ..cado. That's it. Sorry, hon'. Look, hon', just tell him Gloria's here. Look, when the boss doesn't want to be disturbed, he doesn't want to be disturbed. Don't take it personal, like. I have an appointment with Mr. Hill at... ..two o'clock. It's 2:10. So, I had a little trouble getting into the dress! It took me a little while to figure out exactly what to do with these. Sorry, Dicks, there's a... lady here to see you. Says her name is... Gloria. Gloria. From Cleveland. From Cleveland. OK. He never heard of you. He's never heard of me? That's right! Oh, wait. I don't think you understand. This was all set up in advance. I'm Gloria from Cleveland, and I was supposed to be on holodeck four at two and you don't know what I'm talking about, do you? Not to worry. Hey! You can't go in there! Get inside! Close the door! Who's the doll? She's a... the doll's my cousin. Yeah! Gloria. From Cleveland. I'm sorry about this, Gu... Gloria. I didn't mean you to get involved. She knows nothing about this, Johnny. What does that mean? Oh, I see! Yeah, right! Do I look like a jamoke? You ain't nobody's cousin on no visit. What do you know about my money? Your money? The money he stole! You stole his money? Don't listen to him, Gloria. He's lying. Johnny! Johnny! Talk to me, Johnny. I'm a great listener. I'm through with talking, sweetheart. I'm gonna get some action, or else. And this is what you do for fun! It's a mystery! Who is this man? Who killed him? Where's the money he was he talking about? It's... It's a mystery. Now we have to go search for clues. Ah! And that's fun? That's fun! A '48 Packard with white walls. Damn! I didn't get the licence plate. Captain Picard? Sorry, there's no Captain Picard here. Try down at the docks. Ships come in and out every day. It's alright, Madeline, I'll take it in here. Yes, what is it? Captain, Lt Commander Data here. Excuse the unusual interruption, but in the circumstances I thought communicating through the holodeck program less obtrusive. I appreciate your concern, Data. What can I do for you? Long-range sensors detect a T-tauri star in a pocket of the Ngame cloud. That's not unusual. No, sir, but the star's single planet falls in the M-class range. It is capable of supporting life. That is unusual. Highly, sir. Thank you. Procedure requires we investigate. Recall the bridge crew and set a course. Aye, sir. I'm... I'm sorry, Gloria, but there is a 24th-century mystery I have to investigate. You are very welcome to carry on, if you like. No. I've had... enough fun for today. Entering the T-tauri system now, Captain. Sensors show an energy fluctuation in our path. Source unknown. Still picking up energy distortions, but fading. It seems to be gone. A wormhole. Very likely. Extremely unstable wormholes have been mapped near 39 T-tauri systems in the last 100 years alone, sir. I suggest we move to a safer location. It could reappear. Agreed. Take us on a course... Captain! Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission... to explore strange new worlds... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain. Data. Careful, Captain. The stun effect from the wormhole was relatively severe. Apparently so. How long were we unconscious? Approximately 30 seconds. I have scanned the ship and detected no serious crew injuries. You were not affected? No, sir. My positronic system is immune to the effect. This is the third wormhole I have passed through with Starfleet. First, aboard the USS Trieste... Thank you, Mr. Data. Where the hell are we? .54 parsecs from our last position. Almost a day's travel in 30 seconds! Sir, I should realign the ship's clock with Star base 410's signal to adjust for the time distortion. Proceed. This is Crusher in sickbay. Go ahead, Doctor? I have reports of minor injuries. What's happened? We just jumped through a wormhole. Apparently we were all unconscious for 30 seconds. Is everybody alright? There's little or no damage here. Acknowledged. Crusher out. Ship's status? Reports coming in. Nothing serious so far. La Forge here. Impulse engines and warp drive appear unaffected. Shields and weapons systems are fully functional. Counsellor, are you alright? I think so. I'm feeling a bit unfocused. It'll pass. Well, not too bad, all things considered. We're lucky we're not across the galaxy in the middle of next week! That was never actually a possibility. The wormhole's size and short period would make this a local phenomenon. There's still the anomalous M-class planet. Do we go back? The unpredictability of the wormhole makes investigation hazardous. A probe launched from here would be better. Make it so. Nothing broken, but those ligaments have been twisted pretty severely. What on earth were you doing when you fell? Hanging a plant for Keiko, a running project to give me a green thumb. How is it working? Everything I touch seems to turn brown and wither away. Alyssa, would you get me...? Never mind, I'll get it. Don't go away. This isn't possible! Alyssa? Yes, Doctor? Did you see anyone near the lab today? No, I didn't. You didn't adjust the environments on the incubators? I'd never touch your experiments unless you asked me to. Of course not. I'm sorry. Thank you. Probe approaching the T-tauri system. Readings, Data? Coming in now, sir. The probe is within visual range of the planet. On screen. Sensors indicate a hydrogen-helium composition with a frozen helium core. Wait a minute. Sensors indicated a class-M planet before we went through the wormhole. It is possible they were affected by interference from the wormhole. It is clearly not a class-M planet. Run a diagnostic to make sure the wormhole didn't damage the sensors. Aye, sir. Ensign, take us back on a course... Captain. Problem? It's strange a malfunctioning sensor gave such a specific misreading. A time-space disturbance would cause more confusion than that. The sensors may have picked up the after-image of a planet on the other side of the wormhole. We could survey nearby stars for such a planet. It would take six days. No, we don't have time. We've encountered a minor mystery, one that has been solved to my satisfaction. Unless you object, Ensign McKnight should steer a course for Evadne IV. No objection. Ensign. Aye, sir. Come. I have something of a minor mystery on my hands. A minor mystery. That seems to be a recurring phrase these days. Diomedian scarlet moss! I didn't know you were an ethno botanist. It's a hobby. You've got a good crop here. As I recall, it's not easy to cultivate. That's just it. I started these spores right before we were knocked unconscious by the wormhole. You said we were out for 30 seconds? Correct. Then why do these show a full day's growth? Perhaps you've got a fast-growth strain here. Each incubator was set with spores from completely different sources in the Diomedian system. I have more in the lab. Perhaps something extraordinary happened to one of them, but not to all of them. Doctor, we were not unconscious for a whole day. Everything indicates we were out for 30 seconds, the chronometer, the computer, everything. Including Cmdr Data. Jean-Luc, I'm telling you... ..this is over 24 hours of growth. Captain's log, supplemental. Cmdr Data continues to maintain we were unconscious for 30 seconds, despite Dr Crusher's evidence to the contrary. Captain, I have a hypothesis. The 22nd-century physicist Pell Underhill conjectured that a major disruption in time continuity could be compensated for by trillions of counter-reactions. That effect may have allowed Dr Crusher's moss to arrive the other side of the wormhole with unanticipated growth. Underhill was talking about energy. True. Nevertheless, it is possible the phenomenon could occur in matter at higher levels of organization, given the proper conditions. Thank you, Data. An intriguing hypothesis. Well, perhaps we've got a tempest in a test tube after all! Captain... Data, I promised Mr. Nelson you would assist with the sensor diagnostic. You'll find him hard at work on deck 36. As you wish, Captain. You believe him? I want a frank answer, Commander. Not for a second. I'm amazed he even proposed it. What are you suggesting, Captain? I'm not sure, Mr. Worf. I have never known Data to tell a lie. And yet... If we didn't go through the wormhole what happened to us during that day? If we were out for a day, why didn't our beards grow? Whatever it was, it seems Data didn't want to tell us. It could be that whatever caused this situation also affected Data. And it could be that he's telling the truth... ..and that this is all just a minor mystery. We could always check the chronometer for evidence of tampering. A transporter-trace analysis might also indicate how much time has actually passed. Doctor, Commander, make it so. Meanwhile we'll maintain our course. If there is something wrong with Data, we don't want him to be aware of our suspicions. Gentlemen, how goes the battle? Long-range and infrared sensors apparently suffered no ill effects. We're checking heavy-particle detectors. Great. I'll take over now, Data. The Captain wants you on the bridge. See you later in ten-forward? Nelson, I need your help with the computer. How's the elbow? Much better, thanks. This isn't a house call, is it? No, it's not. Tell me, do you remember the last person to use the transporter before the wormhole? Let me check. Ensign Locklin, she's one of my technicians. Tell her to report to sickbay immediately. Electrolyte concentration? 12.5 deviation from previous. Interesting! Check the cellular membranes. I'll bet the inner turgid pressure is off by almost the same amount. 11.3 deviation from the norm. Terrific! That's what I wanted to hear! Thank you, Ensign. That's all. Crusher to Captain Picard. What is it, Doctor? I need to see you immediately. I'm going to Engineering. Join me. Physiologically, each of us is on a daily cycle. Our cells have developed rhythms based on a 24-hour period. The internal clock. Exactly. And I can measure that effect at the molecular level. I took a trace from the last person to use the transporter and compared her cell functions at that time to what they are now. If we were out for only 30 seconds, they should be nearly synchronous. And were they? No. We were out for longer than 30 seconds, Captain. A lot longer. I've got some good news and some bad news. We were right about the chronometer. There's a security program to stop tampering. It was disabled and a new programme fitted. Someone has reset the clock. If that's the good news, what's the bad news? Data and I are the only ones aboard this ship capable of doing it. It is a mystery, Captain. That is an understatement, Data. Is it possible that someone or something could have affected you without your knowing? I am unable to answer that question, sir. Would you consent to being examined by Commander La Forge? As you wish. Will you escort Cmdr Data to Engineering? I know the way, sir. Captain's log, supplemental. It's clear everyone on the Enterprise has lost an entire day. As the mystery of what occurred during those missing hours deepens, so do my doubts about Cmdr Data. We'll start with the higher functions before we get down to basics. Alright. This won't hurt a bit. You forget my sensory inputs are not programmed to experience pain. A figure of speech. Bedside manner. I'm trying to make you comfortable. I am perfectly comfortable. Pattern recognition, syntactic algorithms, heuristic functions. All normal. I notice, however,... that you appear a bit uncomfortable yourself. It just seems like you're not being completely honest with us. I'm your friend. If something's wrong, I want you to tell me. Maybe I can help. I cannot tell you anything beyond what I have already stated. OK. Excuse us, Counsellor? Captain, I finished examining Data. And? Nothing's wrong with the technology. He's in perfect condition. I almost hoped you'd find a problem. He still could be malfunctioning beyond my ability to detect it. This mystery started when our sensors detected that planet, class-M or not. Our sensors failed. Our probe says the planet could not support life. Data launched that probe. If he rigged it, could you prove it? I could try. What happened during that missing day? There must be some clues. Try to think what we were doing before we blacked out, re-enact it... Counsellor? Deanna, are you alright? Just a moment. Yes, I'm fine. What happened? I suddenly became dizzy. I'd better go to my quarters. Perhaps sickbay would be better. No, I'm alright. See the Counsellor to her quarters. Aye, sir. Thank you for coming with me, Mr. Worf. You are certain you are well? I just need some rest. Thanks. Deanna! Security! Override the lock on Counsellor Troi's quarters. Now! What's wrong? The mirror! I came in here, I looked into the mirror... It wasn't me, Worf! It wasn't me! It was my face but it wasn't me inside! Is she alright? I feel fine... now. Signs of stress, adrenaline by-products higher than baseline, but that's normal after sudden fright. All brain functions are OK. What happened, Deanna? It wasn't what I saw, it was... more what I felt. I looked into the mirror, and it seemed a stranger was staring back at me from behind my own eyes... as if my face was a mask! La Forge to Capt Picard. Go ahead. I've found something. I'm on my way. Lt Worf! Doctor. Can I help you? Perhaps not. Worf, you came in here for something. A warrior does not complain about physical discomfort. But the Captain said to report anything out of the ordinary. Are you in pain? How did this happen? Do you recognize this planet, Data? Yes, sir. It is the planet our probe detected in the T-tauri system. No, it's not. Actually, it's Tethys III. I got this image from the ship's library. Its geophysical figures have been altered, but it is Tethys III. Strange, an obscure planet light years away is picked up by the probe. Data, did you take this image and program the probe to send it back to us? I cannot verify that hypothesis. But you don't deny it. No, sir. Mr. La Forge, will you send another probe to the T-tauri system? Yes, sir. I'm sorry, Data. Counsellor Troi has just had a very disturbing hallucination. Is she alright, sir? For the moment. Can you tell me if Deanna's incident is related in any way to this missing time period? No, sir, I cannot. Data, you are the key to this mystery. Why do you block any attempt to solve it? Why are you fighting me? It is not by choice. What do you mean by that? I cannot say. Would you rather endanger Deanna, a friend, than tell me what is going on? Which would you place first, the welfare of a single individual or that of the entire crew? Are you saying that by not co-operating, you are protecting us? I am not saying that. I merely state an alternative explanation. Then, Mr. Data, I'm going to ask you again... ..and I order you to directly answer me. What really happened to us? I cannot answer that. What would you have me do, Data? How would you handle this if our positions were reversed? I am apparently guilty of falsifying the Enterprise's records, of interfering with an investigation, of disobeying a direct order from my commanding officer. Your duty seems clear, sir. Do you know what a court martial would mean? Your career in Starfleet would be finished. I realize that, sir. Do you also realize you'll be stripped down to your wires to find what the hell has gone wrong? Yes, sir. I do. This wrist has been broken. Broken and reset and treated with one of our own bone fusion units. During the missing day? That's the only possibility. Are you suggesting he was conscious? I'm suggesting maybe we all were. I didn't repair a broken wrist while I was unconscious. And our memories of that day? Blocked, possibly erased. By whom? There are very few individuals on board who could break my wrist. Cmdr Data is one of them. I can't accept that explanation. He has the speed and the strength. Granted. But I'm beginning to suspect Data is refusing to co-operate because he believes he is acting in the interests of the Enterprise. La Forge to Captain Picard. Go ahead, Geordi. Probe approaching the planet, sir. Maybe now we'll get some answers. What do you have, Mr. La Forge? Visuals available now. M-class. Nickel-iron core, nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The same planet our sensors picked up before the so-called wormhole. Affirmative. No indication of any space-time distortion whatsoever. We should detect a residual effect even if the wormhole is inactive. That's because there is no wormhole. There never was. Sir? It was a ruse, designed to throw us off the track. Look at the clues. Dr Crusher's incubators, the clock, the transporter trace. All indicate a missing day. And Lt Worf's broken wrist seems to suggest that... ..we were awake and aware for that day, possibly in a struggle for our lives. The fact we're still alive suggests we might have won. Not necessarily, Doctor. Data's behaviour suggests we didn't. Why else would he sacrifice his career rather than tell the truth? If we didn't win and didn't lose... Then the only alternative would be a stalemate. Maybe a compromise was reached that forced Data into this silence. Maybe by uncovering this, we risk upsetting the stalemate. Maybe we should leave well alone. I would live with the mystery, but Data's role in this must be ascertained or he can't be trusted with Starfleet duty. Take us back to the scene of the crime. T-tauri system, warp two. Within sensor range, Captain. Drop to impulse. Worf, maximum shields. Ready all weapons. Shields up. Photon torpedoes armed. Phasers standing by. Captain, an energy field has appeared between us and the planet. On screen. Hold position. Let's see what it does. The field has emitted an energy pulse. It's approaching. Too slow for a photon torpedo. It might be a probe. Let's see what happens when it hits the shields. Shields undamaged. The energy pulse has dispersed. Counsellor Troi, what is it? The plan has failed. You have returned. Your ship is again in our space. I was unable to prevent it. Nevertheless, you are here. The Enterprise is not a threat. Give me time. Our destruction would... Data, Captain wanted me to bring you to the bridge. Counsellor! One moment if you would. Do nothing. It may yet be possible to salvage the situation. Reporting as ordered, Captain. Well, Data, as you can see we're back where it all started. We must leave immediately, sir. Why? Any further delay would put us all at grave risk. Why? What is the source of that risk? The energy field? I cannot say. Data, you sound as if you're stuck in a... feedback loop! You certainly can say. You have free will, a choice. My silence is not by choice, sir. Not by choice? Are you somehow controlled by that force? Did Geordi miss something? His examination was exemplary. Then why are you compelled to disobey my orders? How...? During the missing day,... ..were you contacted by Starfleet? Did they order you to conceal the truth from us? I cannot answer that. We must leave, sir. This ship isn't going anywhere. Not until I get an answer. Now who gave you that order? You did, sir. I ordered you to lie? Captain, the energy field is approaching. Maintain shields at full. No. We must vary shield shape and strength. Maximum shields will speed the ship's takeover. Contact imminent! Do as Data says, at once. Aye, sir. The field is shifting, trying to match our shields. The field will penetrate our shields. There is no way to counter Paxan technology. We can delay their takeover, but cannot prevent it. The Paxans? Who are they? You have invaded our system. No! Worf! You will only harm Troi's body. We are not invaders. We are explorers. Your knowledge of us is unacceptable. They are xenophobes, sir, isolationists. They terraformed a protoplanet in this system to better conceal their whereabouts. The apparent wormhole is actually a trap to keep out invaders. The energy field stuns everyone on board the invading vessel, and places them in a biochemical stasis. That's why our beards didn't grow. The Paxans then remove the ship. So the crew wakes up, think it was a wormhole and keep going. Precisely. What went wrong this time? My positronic brain is a technology unknown to the Paxans. Our stun field did not affect him. He remained conscious as we tried to take over the ship. When I saw the crew was incapacitated, I initiated emergency procedures. Computer, engage emergency plan Z-Z-Alpha. Automatic defence procedures initiated. Energy-field strength increasing. Warning, shield penetration 17 percent. Computer, begin random fluctuation of shield frequency and modulation. Executed. With the ship temporarily protected, I revived the crew. Computer, pump ADTH into the airflow system, five parts per million. Acknowledged. Initiating compound release now. Status, Data. The energy field is attempting to match the shield frequency, sir. Options, Mr. Worf? I do not recommend weapons at this range. Can we go to warp? Negative. The field is also acting as a tractor beam. Warning. Shields have been penetrated. All systems are frozen. The Paxans can manipulate energy structures on many levels. They took control of Counsellor Troi's body to communicate with us. Captain! No, stop, everyone! Who are you? You are aware of our existence. Our attempt to place you in biochemical stasis has failed. We have no choice but to destroy this ship. If you destroy this ship, others will come in search of us. Knowledge of your civilization will be spread across half the galaxy. No. Allow us safe passage and I will protect your right to privacy to the best of my ability. We will never tell of your existence. There are over 1,000 life forms on this vessel. How could you assure their silence? This biochemical stasis, does it suppress synaptic function? It does. Then you are capable of affecting memory. Can you erase the short-term memory of everyone on this ship, remove all knowledge of this event and allow us to proceed? It would take time. One of your days. He is immune to our influence. Data, I'm going to give you a most unusual order. I'm not sure you will be able to integrate it into your program. As a Starfleet officer, I'm required to follow your orders. Good, because our survival depends on it. I am ordering you never to reveal what has happened here today, not to Starfleet, not to myself even. You will conceal your knowledge of the Paxans for as long as you exist. Do you fully understand, Data? Completely, sir. Satisfactory? Agreed. Good. Now our task is to eliminate from the ship's records any information that might lead to knowledge of this incident. Let's get to work. We erased all evidence of our encounter with the Paxans. I reset the computer's chronometer and again the crew were stunned, their short-term memories erased. When they were revived a day later the adjustments made it seem only 30 seconds had passed. And here we are. Here we are again. Your plan has failed. This ship must be destroyed. No! Wait! The plan failed because clues were left behind that suggested a mystery, and to many humans a mystery is irresistible. It must be solved. The doctor's incubator, Worf's wrist, Troi's hallucinations. Little pieces of evidence suggesting more clues... the clock, the transporter trace, Data's odd behaviour. If we eliminate the clues and begin again... Again? Yes. Consider the first time a run-through, a rehearsal to shake out the flaws. The second time will succeed if we leave no clues. You are a most unusual species,... ..worthy of a second chance. Proceed. Welcome back, Counsellor. Geordi, Data, reconfigure the computer records. Number One, oversee the rest of the ship. And this time, let's get it right. What happened? The effect from the wormhole was intense. So it would seem. Everyone but I was rendered unconscious. My positronic system is immune. How long were we out? 30 seconds, sir. Position? .54 parsecs from our previous position. Bearing 285 mark 147. It could be worse. Yes, sir. The wormhole was a local phenomenon. Crusher to Bridge. What happened? The Enterprise went through a wormhole. It seems the entire crew was unconscious for about 30 seconds. Is anyone on the bridge hurt? Apparently not. I'll check the other decks. Out. Status reports? Shields and weapons unaffected. No damage in Engineering. Counsellor? There's a feeling of disorientation on board, but nothing serious. Very well. There's still that anomalous class-M planet to investigate. Ensign, replot a course back to... Sir, it is likely the readings were a result of the wormhole's effect. It was extremely unstable. I recommend against returning. It might put the Enterprise at further risk. We could launch a probe. That would be sufficient. Make it so. And put out a hazard advisory to Starfleet. Set a course for Evadne IV. Aye, sir. Engage. "
S4E15,"Dr Nessor, please contact station 12. Dr Nessor, contact station 12. Careful! He may have cranium damage. Move him onto the diagnostic pad. Slowly! Right. Here we go. Slowly. That's good. Alright, careful. Readings? They're fluctuating, sir. He took a severe blow. Possible trauma to the telencephalon. Start quadroline. We'll need a complete del-scan series. I can't find his cardial organ. There's circulation. There it is. Up here. In his digestive tract? Ever seen anything like this? He's missing three costal struts on one side... ..and four on the other! Think that's something? Look at this! He has digits on his terminus! What are you?! Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. What happened? You're in the crisis room at the Sikla Medical Facility. You've had a severe injury, but you'll be alright. I was caught in the riots when the police moved in. It's the last thing I remember. Can you tell us your name? Rivas. Rivas Jakara. Rivas Jakara? Where do you live? In the Marta community on the southern continent. You're a long way from home. Do you have any family we should notify? No, I have no family. I have to get back. You're in no condition to leave yet. There are unusual things about your case, Mr. Jakara. Your cranial lobes, for instance, they seem to be surgical implants. I had cosmetic surgery to correct a genetic birth defect. And these? Another birth defect? Yes. Isn't that something? My father's were the same way. You're saying your abnormalities are inherited genetic traits? I understand your confusion. My personal physician is much more familiar with these genetic irregularities. To be honest, I would feel much better back home under her care. I'll talk to her. What's her name? Crusher. Actually, I'm not sure you'll be able to reach her. Why not? She's taking a sabbatical. Well, we'll do the best we can for you. There was one other thing. We found this curious-looking device in your clothes. What is it? Just a toy. I was taking it home as a present. I thought you had no family. It's for a neighbour's child. Was anything else found? I had one piece of jewellery, a metal pin. No, I'm sorry, this was all we found. Genetic irregularities? That thing isn't even the same species! Keep your voice down! The last thing we need is a panic over.... All the space flights have attracted creatures from outer space! That's what I don't want to hear! What will you do? Of all the medical facilities available,... ..why did he have to end up here? We ought to call Central Security. Not till we've done a lot more. A lot more. I want his story checked out. Search the library to make sure we've never seen anything like him. What if there's more of them? They could be everywhere! I want security on his door 29 hours a day, and I want this kept quiet! Code-three drill in B Wing. All instructors report immediately. Code-three drill. All instructors report. At 12.4 after launch, the warp field generator will be activated. And break the light barrier? Yes, Chancellor. If we succeed, the craft will leave our star system and in minutes will head for the Garth system. And then what? And then, Krola, we'll see what's there. How long, Mirasta? We have the prototype design for the warp engine. We'd simply have to build the production units. If I get your approval today, ten months, maybe less. Chancellor, I'll admit Mirasta's enthusiasm for her work is seductive, but perhaps we're moving too fast. Your opponents will see this as another example of you going against traditional ways. My opponents look back as I look forward. I do believe my people would choose to retreat after all we've done. I agree. The people accepted your social reforms because they believe in you. But there are many who say we have gone far enough. All these new ideas, new technology, and now space travel? It confuses them, frightens them. I will not allow them to remain in the dark ages. The warp programme will proceed as you have outlined, Mirasta. And then we will slow down, Krola, to let everyone catch their breath. Including you. Mirasta Yale? Yes. Please. Don't be alarmed at our appearance. My name is Jean-Luc Picard. This is my associate, Deanna Troi. What are you? We've come with some very important information. About what? About space. About the universe you are preparing to enter. We come from a federation of planets. Capt Picard is from Earth, which is over 2,000 light years from here. I'm from another planet called Betazed. We've monitored your progress toward warp-drive capability. When a society reaches your level of technology and is about to initiate warp travel, we feel the time is right for first contact. We prefer meeting like this, rather than a random confrontation in deep space. We've come to you first as a leader in the scientific community. Scientists generally accept our arrival more easily than others. We usually encounter shock and fear on this sort of mission. We hope you will help us to facilitate our introduction. Is this a joke? Did Lupo and the others from the lab put you up to this? It's no joke. You can see we're physically different from Malcorians. And, with your permission, I'm prepared to prove it to you. I would like that. Picard to Enterprise. Three to beam up. It's everything I ever dreamed of! When I was a child, my parents would take me to the planetarium, and we would sit in the dark and it was as if I was on a spaceship, on my way to another world, to meet people on other planets. Part of me is waiting for the lights to come up and the programme to end. How did you know about me? We learn as much as possible about a planet before we make first contact. One of the things we monitor are your broadcast signals, your journalism, your music, your humour. Try to understand you better as a people. I hate to think how you would judge us based on our popular music and entertainment! Indeed, we do get an incomplete picture, which is why we also do... ..surface reconnaissance. You've had people on our planet? For several years. These are specialists, highly trained observation teams, superficially identical to you, and able to blend naturally into your society. We've discovered that the most hazardous aspect of these missions is the lack of sufficient information. You don't have to explain. I understand, although not everybody on my planet would. They would think you were trying to infiltrate our society. Well, there is a difficulty here, one that has forced us to accelerate this entire process. One of our people is missing. My first officer, Cmdr William Riker, was on the planet surface coordinating, with the observation team, the final details of contact. He disappeared. My people have made enquiries but not yet located him. If you could help... Of course! Where was Riker's last known location? The capital city. He was under the name Rivas Jakara, a tourist from the Marta community. We must find him before someone realizes what he really is. If this gets out prematurely, it could seriously complicate matters. Our ideology is based on the assumption that the Malcorian is a supreme life form, and our world is the centre of the universe. Your arrival will change our entire understanding of life. And some will not want it to change. What about Durken? Durken. He will be open-minded, but cautious. You should not discuss your surveillance teams with him. At least, not right away. With the disappearance of Cmdr Riker, wouldn't it be prudent... Capt Picard, I must ask you to trust me on this. If you tell the Chancellor about Cmdr Riker, you will undermine everything. Durken will assign Krola, our minister of security, to find him. Krola has his own political agenda. He will perceive you as the greatest threat our people have ever known. And he will not hesitate to use Riker to prove that he is correct. From another planet, hundreds of them! It doesn't make sense that he's the only one. Think about it. I said this was to be kept a secret! You know Nilrem. It's getting out of control. I don't know what else he is, but he is still a patient in this facility. We have a responsibility for his care and recovery. Remind them of that. You can't contain this much longer. I know. If people get scared enough, anything could happen. Mr. Jakara, we have been unable to confirm anything you told us. No physician named Crusher is on file. Not on this planet. Your address in Marta is an eating establishment. The cook knows no Rivas Jakara. It's a misunderstanding. There are people on the other side of that door who believe that you are not one of us. Not one of you? That you are from another planet. Are you, Mr. Jakara? You realize what you're saying? I know how it sounds. I'm not anxious to make a fool of myself. This new era of space flight, it fires the imagination. People see unidentified vessels in the sky that turn out to be weather balloons. Well, it's far more likely that I'm a weather balloon than an alien! Our medical journals document genetic mutation in recent history. Some unusual physical disfigurations have occurred. I'm just another case for your journals, then. Perhaps. But you, Mr. Jakara, are hiding something. And unless you tell me the truth about yourself, this rumour will persist and grow and could even become dangerous, most especially to you. Chancellor. Mirasta Yale would like to introduce someone. Call back. See if the Vice-Chancellor will do. They're out here, waiting to see you, sir. Alright. Send them in. Always time to meet your friends, Mirasta. Chancellor, I think you might want to clear your afternoon schedule. And this is the bridge. Chancellor. Environment and Engineering stations, mission operations and the two main science stations. Data, allow me to introduce Chancellor Avel Durken and Space Administrator Mirasta Yale. Chancellor, Minister. Cmdr Data is my second officer. He's an android, Chancellor, a constructed being! A machine? In a way. The term ""artificial life form"" would be more accurate. Captain, is there someplace we might speak together without distraction? Certainly. Chancellor, with your permission, I'd like to beam to the surface. I have matters to attend to. Not a word to anyone about this. Of course. Mr. Data, will you escort the Minister? Chancellor. Still no communication from Cmdr Riker? No. He has not returned to our designated coordinates. We have continued to scan the capital, without success. I've been saving this for a special occasion. My brother, on Earth, produces a fruit known as ""grapes"" which he turns into wine. He's really quite good at it. Chancellor, we have a tradition called a ""toast"". It is a drink to salute one's friends and good fortune. And I would like to propose a toast to our new friendship. We have something like this on Malcor III. I think we shall find we have much in common. And much that is not in common. An opportunity to learn from one another. You speak the language of diplomacy well. A language I appreciate and understand. But I have learned to not always trust it. Trust requires time and experience. My world's history has recorded that conquerors often arrived with the words, ""We are your friends"". We are not here as conquerors. What do you want? A beginning. But how we proceed is entirely up to you. And if our wishes conflict? There'll be no conflict. And if I should tell you to leave and never return to my world? We will leave and never return. Chancellor, we are here only to help guide you into a new era. I can assure you, we will not interfere in the natural development of your planet. That is, in fact, our Prime Directive. I can infer from that directive that you do not intend to share all this exceptional technology with us. That is not the whole meaning, but part of it. Is this how you maintain superiority? Chancellor, to instantly transform a society with technology would be harmful, and it would be destructive. You're right, of course. I'm overwhelmed, Capt Picard. I'm quite overwhelmed. I go home each night to a loving wife, two beautiful daughters. We eat the evening meal together as a family. I think that's important. They always ask me if I've had a good day. And how will you answer them tonight, Chancellor? I will have to say, this morning, I was the leader of the universe as I knew it. This afternoon, I am only a voice in a chorus. But I think it was a good day. There are guards out there. You'll never escape that way. I'm not afraid of you. Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. We shouldn't fear the unknown. We should embrace it. Can you help me get out of here? Are you really an alien? It's alright to tell me. No, I'm not an alien. I don't believe you. You are an alien. I really have to leave. I can divert the guard's attention. You might stand a chance through the service exit to the right. To the right? Fine, let's do it. Why should l? Well, you know why. I don't belong here. I have to get back on my ship, in space! I believe you! Now, will you help me? If you make love to me. What? I've always wanted to make love with an alien. Listen, Miss...? Lanel. Lanel, I really have to get going. All the other aliens are waiting for me. It's not so much to ask, and then I'll help you escape. It's not that easy. There are differences in the way that my people make love. I can't wait to learn! But, it's... It's your only way out of here... ..my alien! Something's happened to him, I think he's dead. Go on, get help! OK! No! That way! Thanks. Will I ever see you again? I'll call you the next time I pass through your star system. Stop him! Somebody stop him! Hold it! He's escaping! The alien's escaping! Grab him! Get him! Get him! Stop it! All of you! Stop it, now! Have you all lost your minds? They've aggravated the injury to his renal organ. He's bleeding internally. Get him into a surgical cubicle. And call Central Security. This has gone too far! Their leader, Picard, has made it clear that how we proceed is entirely our decision. You cannot possibly be suggesting surrender! They're not hostile! Mirasta, you are incredibly naive. Are you so enraptured with space that you are blind to this threat? I have seen their vessel, Krola. If they chose to be hostile, we would not be standing here. Why should they use force, when we are ready to lay down in fear? I do not lay down in fear, to them or to you, Krola. I mean no disrespect, but I have repeatedly warned you about your policies, taking us too quickly where we have no business going! New philosophies, new economics, new technologies! Many still value our traditional way of life and I am willing to die to defend it! Open your eyes, Krola! We are part of a greater community. We cannot ignore it! You would ignore them as they infiltrate and spy on us! What are you saying, Krola? We have captured one of their spies. Chancellor, he is Capt Picard's first officer, Cmdr Riker. You knew about this, Mirasta? He has been missing for two days. I told Capt Picard not to discuss this because I was afraid this would happen. What else do you know, Mirasta? Everything! They have been on our planet, observing, for several years. Years! Imagine what they have done. Influenced our young, stirred up dissent. They were collecting information. Where is this Cmdr Riker now? He's in the Sikla Medical Facility. He's recovering from surgery. He suffered head injuries in an escape attempt. He will recover consciousness in a few hours. Will he survive? I didn't think he'd survive the injuries. I have to interrogate him before he dies. At least give him time to regain some strength. Come back tomorrow. It cannot wait until tomorrow. Krola, we can get help from his ship. With their medical technology, he might recover. We're not giving him back. He's the one advantage we have, now. Use your drugs to revive him. Those drugs increase cardial rate. That's the last thing he needs. It'd probably be enough to kill him. You can't do it! Revive him. I'm just a physician, Minister. I know little about affairs of State, but he is a living, intelligent being. I don't care if the Chancellor himself calls. I have sworn an oath to do no harm, and I will not. Then I'll find someone to replace you. Chancellor. You are punctual, Captain. I know how busy you are. Do you? You know much more about me than I know about you! In what respect? You speak of trust and peace and working together to enter a new era. But you conduct secret surveillance posing as Malcorians. Cmdr Riker? Cmdr Riker. Mirasta said it would be a mistake to discuss... Yes, she's already tried to accept responsibility. It was my error, not hers. Chancellor, there is no starship mission more dangerous than first contact. We never know what we will face when we open a door on a new world, how we will be greeted, what exactly the dangers will be. Centuries ago, contact with the Klingon Empire led to decades of war. It was decided then we would do surveillance before making contact. It was a controversial decision. I believe it prevented more problems than it created. I can appreciate the logic of your position, Captain. But full disclosure after contact would have been in order. In time, there would have been full disclosure. Please believe that. On other worlds, it would not be an issue. But here, everything our observers reported indicated that the people of this world would almost certainly react negatively to our arrival. We could see that even surveillance might be interpreted as an act of aggression. I hoped that we would have found Cmdr Riker before you did, so that this matter would not complicate our introduction. It was a mistake. Yes. A mistake I might have made in your place. I rather like it, actually. Like it? That you make mistakes, like any man. Chancellor, I have made some fine ones in my time! Now, I must ask you, will you release my officer? We'll talk again later, Captain. Enterprise, one to beam up. Yes, I understand. I have been relieved of my duties, as I'm sure you already know. You are Acting Director of the facility, Nilrem. Revive him. Leave us. I am Minister Krola of Internal Security. You are Riker, an alien. Yes, we know. Please bring my people here. In time. In time. But first, I need to ask you some questions. Thank you for seeing me. If I did not depend so much on your expertise in space matters, I would have asked for your resignation. I felt I was acting in our people's best interests. When you are selected to occupy this office, then you may decide on the best interests of our people! Picard I can excuse. But you, Mirasta, you should have trusted me. We must release Riker. Any hope for a relationship with these people depends on it. I can't afford to be the idealist you are, Mirasta. Riker... I am prepared to release Riker, after we have interrogated him. Are you prepared for him to die, Chancellor? His injuries are extremely serious. A mob at the medical facility almost killed him. Krola has ordered drugs to be used to revive him. Drugs that are dangerous for him. Without medical aid from his ship, Riker will not survive the day. You must tell Picard where he is. You have lied since your capture and I believe you are lying now. We're here on a mission of peace. Such noble creatures! Why do peaceful people develop such lethal weapons? Or do you still insist it's just a toy? An interesting toy, to be sure! It's only used for defence. Perhaps, like many conquerors, you believe your goals to be benevolent. I cannot. For, however you describe your intentions, you still represent the end to my way of life. I cannot permit that to occur. Eventually, Durken would choose to welcome your people with arms open and eyes closed. I must force him down another path. When they find us, I will be dead, killed by your weapon. The lines will be drawn. A peaceful accord will no longer be an option. No... ! For my people! What happened? He shot him! The alien shot Krola! Get me three octares of adrulmine, EN charge unit, now! I have a circulation pattern. It's very weak. We have to get him on vital buffers now! I'm a physician. Don't be frightened. I need to know what happened. Are you doctors? Yes. He shot him. With that thing! Crusher to Picard. Go ahead. Riker is near death. There's brain activity. I need to beam him up. Acknowledged. There's a male with a phaser wound to the chest. I need to get him back, as well. We'll meet you on the Enterprise. Out. They'll both be OK. We were able to stabilize Will. If we had been any later... Krola? He was never in any real danger. The phaser was on stun. Stun? It's a defensive weapon. Do you know what happened? The angle of impact suggests that Krola's left hand was on the phaser. They were struggling? Cmdr Riker was in no position to offer any kind of struggle. Krola was trying to be a martyr? Where is this? You're aboard the starship, my foolish old friend. No, Chancellor, you must not... You must not pursue relations with them. Must not! I know. But, Chancellor... Mirasta. It goes against every instinct of my being. My people are not ready to accept what you represent. What happened in the hospital proves that. And Krola is the best evidence of all. We must slow down and allow those who are like him to join us in the present before we can move into the future. But when we encounter other beings, our people must be ready! The warp programme will be delayed. We'll divert resources to education and social development to prepare for when we are ready. Chancellor, I strongly disagree! I know. Captain, you once said if I asked you to leave, you would do so without hesitation. I'm afraid I must ask you to do just that. Well, it's your decision, Chancellor. But I must say, I regret I won't have the opportunity of knowing your people better. We're a good people, a society with much potential. Once we cross into space, we shall have to give up this self-importance, this conceit that we are the centre of the universe. But this is not the time for that. For now, we will have to enjoy that sweet innocence. How will you keep a secret when so many have seen and heard so much? Stories will be told for many years, I have no doubt. Of the ship that made contact, of the alien who was held prisoner. There'll be charges of a government conspiracy. The witnesses will tell their tales and people will laugh, and go back and watch the more interesting fiction of the daily broadcasts. It will pass. I'm sorry to say he's probably right. Capt Picard, I have one last request. Take me with you. She'll be unhappy with the restrictions I must place upon her at home. We may not be back here in your lifetime. And I have to believe that you cannot be fully prepared for the realities of space travel. I have been prepared for those realities since I was nine years old, sitting in a planetarium! Mr. Worf to my ready room. Escort Chancellor Durken to the transporter room. And assign quarters to Minister Yale. She will be remaining on board. Aye, sir. Until we return, then. With luck, we'll both be around to renew our friendship, Captain. "
S4E16,"Captain's log, star date 44614.6. We are approaching Star base 313 to pick up scientific equipment for transport to an outpost in the Guernica system. During the journey we will be hosting a special guest. Come. You wanted to see me, Captain? Yes, Mr. La Forge. The exemplary nature of your work has caught the eye of Starfleet Command. In fact, someone is coming on board just to see the engine modifications you've made. Who, Captain? The senior design engineer at the propulsion group. Dr Leah Brahms. Leah is coming here? This is terrific! It is? Well, I mean I've studied her... schematics for years. She did a lot of the engine design on the Enterprise. Then it should be an enjoyable visit. She'll come aboard at the star base. Would you like to greet her on our behalf? I would love to, Captain. Thank you. If you keep picking at that uniform, you'll wear it out. I guess I am a little nervous. It's not every day a man gets to face his dream. What? Remember about a year ago when we were caught in that booby trap? OK. While we tried to escape, I went to the holodeck to study an engine prototype made when the Enterprise was designed. And the computer, it gave me an image of the engine, but it also created this hologram of the designer, Dr Leah Brahms. So you met a computer-simulated female? Yeah, but not an ordinary computer-simulated female. I mean, she was brilliant, of course, but... ..warm, you know? Friendly. It was like we worked as one. I would start a sentence, she'd finish it. What I didn't think of, she did. It was just... so comfortable. OK, I know it was just an image, but the computer incorporated personality traits from her Starfleet record. Everybody falls in love with a fantasy every now and then. No, no, you've got it all wrong. I'm not necessarily expecting anything romantic. It's just... I know whatever, Leah Brahms and I will be good friends. Dr Brahms is ready to transport, sir. OK, bring her over. Hi. I mean... welcome aboard, Dr Brahms. I'm Lt Cmdr Geordi La Forge, Chief Engineer. La Forge. So you're the one who's fouled up my engine designs. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... to boldly go where no one has gone before. The matter-antimatter ratio has changed. The mixture isn't as rich as it should be. Experience shows too high a ratio diminishes efficiency. I worked with the mixture until I found a balance. The plasma transfer doesn't correspond to recommended specs. Again, I adjusted the flow. Things happen differently here than they do on a drawing board. Is that a criticism? No, of course not! It's just a well-known fact. There's theory and application. They don't always jive. You've charted a completely new schedule for part replacement. You bet! Starfleet estimates for the MTBF units were unrealistic. I simply determined my own schedule based on observation and experience. Is that going to be your only defence, that same tired rhetoric? ""Out here we learn things designers can't understand."" First, I'm not aware of needing any defence. Second, if you want to be... Dr Brahms, you have an incoming message on subspace. I'd like to hear it privately. In my office. Be my guest. Thank you. Commander, I am picking up unusual readings in the Alpha Omicron system. At this range all I can discern is an asymmetrical field of intense energy. What type of radiation signature? Unknown, sir. The Alpha Omicron system is yet to be charted. I recommend we take this chance for further research. Well, we're way ahead of schedule. Alter course for Alpha Omicron. Dr Brahms, there's no reason to argue. We're on the same side here. I'm aware of that. Why don't I take you on a tour, show you the adjustments I've made, why I think they work, and we can begin pulling together on this? OK. Then why not start with the dilithium chamber? OK? OK. The anomaly is orbiting the seventh planet. It is a mass of plasma energy held within discrete boundaries by a covering of silicates, actonides and carbonaceous chondrites. On screen. Magnify. Is it a ship? It is not of any known design. Any similar phenomena in Starfleet listings? No, sir. This has never been seen before. Ensign Rager, ahead one-quarter impulse. Aye, sir. Orbit the seventh planet. Keep us at a distance of 10 km from the object. Alert science stations. Tell them to coordinate with Data. Aye, sir. What happened here? Who did this? You. Remember? You adjusted the direction of the lattice structure. Remember? Why would I remember? Right. Why would you? Well, the ship was having some difficulty. We made this adjustment hoping that it would work, and it did. So, it was your idea? Not exclusively, no. It's curious. This modification was due to be introduced... ..in the next-class starship. Yes. How did you know that? I didn't. I mean... It's the next logical step, right? Listen, we fly by the seat of our pants out here. Once in a while we'll come up with the same solutions you do. I've got a personnel review in about five minutes. I know you've had a long day. Why don't we get together later? Sort of... plan out our agenda for the next day or two? Agenda? What it is we want to accomplish, how we might go about that, maybe get to know each other. It might make this easier. Maybe you're right. OK, great. How about... my quarters? 1900 hours? Maybe even have a bite to eat? I make a great fungilli. I love fungilli. Is that right? Sensors are having trouble penetrating the interior. But the radiated output suggests a coherent system of energy storage and utilization. Then it was constructed by someone? Possibly. However, the data gathered thus far suggests a natural phenomenon with biological properties. A life form. Yes, Captain. Mr. Worf, begin compiling readings to transmit to Starfleet headquarters. Data, launch three level-five probes. Ensign, aft thrusters. Standard observational posture. Level-five probe sequence ready for launch, Commander. On your mark. Stand by, Mr. Data. Aye, sir. What would it be like? No ship, no bulky spacesuit. Just to live between the stars, have the entire galaxy as a home. Captain, we are being probed. Recommend we raise shields. Negative, Mr. Worf. If we are curious about it, it has a perfect right to be curious about us. Change in reading. It has increased energy output by 50 percent. It is moving toward us. Reverse course, Ensign. 300 kph. Aye, sir. Easy. We don't want to alarm or provoke it. We are caught in an energy-damping field. Raise shields. No effect, Captain. Reverse power. Full impulse. Impulse engines at full power. No change in position, sir. Red alert. Mr. La Forge, prepare to initiate warp drive. There's too much interference to form a warp field. Warning: radiation at 65 millirads per minute and rising. Riker to Dr Crusher. Go ahead, Commander. Prepare for radiation protocol. Acknowledged. Crusher out. Warning: radiation levels rising. Lethal exposure in one minute. Mr. Worf, ready phasers. Minimum power. Ready. Fire. Radiation levels dropping to normal. Energy patterns are breaking down, sir. The radiation signature is no longer stable. Energy output is negligible. Radiation patterns no longer coherent. I believe it is dead, sir. We're out here to explore, to make contact with other life forms, to establish peaceful relations, but not to interfere. And absolutely not to destroy. Yet look at what we have just done. Captain, everything you did was consistent with Starfleet procedures. Number One, you have the bridge. Captain... Sensors are picking up a new energy reading from the life form. Elaborate, Data. There is a new concentration of radiation growing in the centre of its body. Then... ..perhaps it's still alive. OK... Computer, subdued light. No, that's too much. I don't want it dark, I want it cosy. Please state your request in precise candlepower. It's not a matter of precision, Computer, it's a matter of mood. Brighter than this. More. More. A little more. Hold! Right there. Perfect. Now, some... some music. Maybe... Maybe a little soft jazz. No, that's not right. Let me think here. I got it! Some Brahms. A piano étude. Nah, that's... that's too corny. Probably everybody thinks of that. Just give me some guitar. Classical guitar. Doesn't matter who. Yes. Thank you. Come on in. You've changed. Yeah. The uniforms are so... formal. You're less formal than any Starfleet officer I've ever met, Commander. Am l? I really just wanted to make you feel more comfortable. I'm fine. Thank you. I'm sorry. Come in and... have a seat. Can I get you a drink? No, thank you. You sure? You know, your hair. It's... It's different. Different than a few hours ago? No, I mean it's different than I expected. Different from your records. Oh, yes. I used to wear it up. Yeah. Why would you need to see my files? Standard procedure when guests come on board. Protocol. I mean, it was nothing specific. Just... you know. Cmdr La Forge... If I seem to be somewhat unyielding in my views, it's because I care so very much about my work. Oh, I know. To be honest, people find me cold, cerebral, lacking in humour. But they're wrong, I assure you. Well, I try not to be that way, but when it comes to my designs, my engines, especially the ones on the Enterprise... It's... like... ..they're your children. Yes. Exactly. So naturally you're a little possessive about them. You understand that? Yes, I do. You see... I feel the same way. That's amazing. I don't think anyone has ever... Sometimes I feel more comfortable with engine schematics than people. Well, maybe you just haven't met the right... people. You hungry? I'm hungry. Why don't I just... start dinner? OK? Commander... Please, call me Geordi. I'm sorry. I hope I didn't put you to a lot of trouble but I can't stay. You can't? I just don't think it's appropriate. I'll meet with you at 0800 tomorrow. I'm preparing a list of discrepancies I've identified in the modifications. I hope, now that we've reached an understanding, that you'll be prepared to discuss them in a more objective fashion. Sure. Fine. Thank you. Good night, Commander. Good night? This new concentration of energy was detected only after the surrounding material became inert. Could this be tissue regeneration? The radiation resembles the original but with significant differences. Some kind of reaction to our phaser fire perhaps. I believe it is self-contained within the body of the dead life form. Another entity. Yes, sir. It appears to be a less-developed version of the original creature. No wonder it attacked us. It was about to give birth. Doctor. It's dangerous to generalize about new life forms. But based on my experience with other beings who bear young in this manner, I'd say the offspring is still premature. Otherwise, it would break through the body shell of the parent. Will it be able to survive on its own, without the parent? There's no way to tell. We don't have enough on the bio-functions of the adult, much less the child. Is there any way we can help? If we were in sickbay I'd try a Caesarean section. The first priority is to free it from the body of the parent. We could use our phasers as a scalpel. Yes, that might work. I advise against this. The parent was a threat to the ship. We do not know how the offspring will react. Objection noted, Mr. Worf. But we are directly responsible for the death of the parent. We cannot simply wash our hands of it now. Doctor, we will proceed at your discretion. Good morning. Good morning. I'd like to inspect the power-transfer conduits. You realize the only way to inspect them is to crawl inside? I designed them, Commander. I know what's involved. Here we go. Power taps. Watch yourself! The acoustic signature doesn't sound right. You're the only other person in the galaxy who could pick that up. What's causing it? It's right up here. I've never seen anything like this before. What is it? It's a mid-range phase adjuster. Re-phases the plasma after inertial distortion. This has never been done before. I don't think it's ever even been conceived of before. You should write a paper. Uh-uh, Doctor. No! Writing is not one of my strong suits. But this kind of refinement should be shared. And you deserve the credit. Well, maybe we could... collaborate. Writing is one of your strong points. Cmdr La Forge, ever since I came on board there seems to be something peculiar about your attitude. You seem to know things about me, even though we've never met. Well... To tell you the truth... I've studied you. Your writings, your Starfleet file. I've admired you. You know, your work. Well, I'm flattered, but... And... Well, I really... I wanted to meet you for a long time. And... I'd like to think that... we could become friends. Maybe good friends. I thought you knew. You know everything else about me. But, Commander, if I'm hearing what I think I'm hearing,... ..then you should know that I'm married. Set phaser power to three percent, narrow beam. Three percent. Alright. Here we go. First incision complete. Ideally it should be able to push through the outer shell by itself. I think it needs more help. We've done all we can. I don't want to risk killing it by accident. Come on. You can do it. Captain, I'd like to announce the birth of a large baby... something. Well done, Doctor. Well done. How could it have been so far off? It was based on every piece of information on record about her. OK, with a margin for error, but this is an error that's about a light year wide. Not what you hoped for, huh? Guinan, the woman is about as friendly as a Circassian plague cat, only cares about her work, hates what I've done to her engines... And, to top it all off, she's married. Computer never even told me she was married. Computer glitch? Must have been. Maybe it was your old visor. What are you talking about? The one you wore on the holodeck with her. Guinan, it's the same visor. Really? I figured it was the one that lets you see what you want to see. What's that supposed to mean? You saw exactly what you wanted to see on the holodeck. Sure, the computer made it look like her, gave it personality. But when it came to the relationship, you... filled in the blanks. And you had a perfectly wonderful, marvellous little fantasy. Until the real Leah showed up and ruined it. She's done the most horrific thing one person can do to another: not lived up to your expectations. So I'd take a good, long, hard look at her, La Forge. See her for who she is, not for what you want her to be. Its patterns are stable. It seems able to withstand solar radiation. Good. Head for the Guernica system. Aye, sir. We're not staying? No. We've done all we can. It's time to move on. This creature can continue to exist without further interference from us. It might be wise to move away before we initiate warp drive. Very well. 500 kph, Ensign. Engage. Captain, it is following us. Maintaining a distance of four kilometres, directly astern. 17 degrees to port, Ensign. Aye, sir. It is turning with us, sir. Increase to half impulse. It is matching our velocity. It's imprinted on us. It thinks the Enterprise is its mother. Change in energy readings, sir. A build-up of gamma particles... Its velocity is increasing. It is moving toward the ship. Evasive manoeuvres. Full... Report. Minor damage. It is now in direct contact with the hull, sir. On screen. Mr. Data? Sir, it is draining energy directly from the fusion reactors. It's feeding off the ship's energy as it would from its mother. What action should we take, sir? None, Lieutenant. None at all. Captain's log, supplemental. Since the newborn has attached itself to us it has been making great demands on the ship's energy, but we have stabilized our power systems temporarily. How long before the power drain becomes critical? At this rate, six, maybe seven hours. We may be able to extend that a little longer. That would be appreciated. By then Junior may not need us. Mr. Data, can we determine what the parent's destination might have been? I can attempt to extrapolate from the heading it was on. Perhaps it was on its way to a safe environment for its newborn. We might be able to deliver it there. But how do we get Junior off the hull once we get there? It's almost covering the door of shuttle bay two. If we open the door and deactivate the force field... ..the pressure from inside the ship might push it away from the hull. Make it so. Sir... Is the appellation ""Junior"" to be the life form's official name? No, it is not! We can save energy just by improving engine efficiency. We've had these problems before. It's why I reoriented the crystal. And why you added phase adjustors? Right. Commander, you've made more modifications than I'm aware of. Do you have a file on your work? It's in the computer. Picard to La Forge. Here. I need to see you on the bridge. On my way, Captain. You go on ahead. Ensign Pavlick can show you the file on the engine. ""Phase coils upgraded to 55 field densities."" ""Plasma inducers interlinked with generator."" Ensign, are there any files with data on the original specifications? I believe so, Doctor. This file utilises the prototype engine schematic. It's a holographic program, set in the drafting room at Utopia Planitia. I'll run it on holodeck three. Computer, replay program 9140. Engine schematic at Utopia Planitia. Program loaded and ready. She went where? Holodeck three. I saw nothing wrong with her seeing the file. No, of course not. Nothing at all! I'm with you every day, Geordi. Every time you look at this engine, you're looking at me. Every time you touch it, it's me. Computer, freeze program. Now I understand. You don't. It's not the way this may look. I called up a replay of the program file. I was ready to compliment you again, for constructing a program which contained the prototype engine as a baseline reference for your modifications. And now I find that it's all about a... fantasy plaything. It's not like that, I swear. I'm outraged by this! I have been invaded, violated! How dare you use me like this? How far did it go, anyway? Was it good for you? Nothing happened. It was a professional collaboration! I can tell. ""Touch the engine and you're touching me."" Real professional! Did you watch the whole program? We were working together to solve a problem in a crisis! How do I know how far it went? How many programs did you create? One for every day of the week, one for every mood? Alright, look! Since you arrived, you've been badgering me. And I've taken it. I've shown you courtesy and respect and a hell of a lot of patience. Oh, no. Wait a minute. I've tried to understand you. I've tried to get on with you. And in return you've convicted me without even hearing my side of it. So I'm guilty, OK? But not of what you think! Of something much worse. I'm guilty of reaching out to you. Of hoping we could connect. I'm guilty of a terrible crime, Doctor. I offered you friendship. Captain, its volume has increased by 8.5 percent in the last three hours. It is now 46 million cubic metres. Captain, I have completed the analysis of the parent's course. It was headed for an asteroid belt. Ensign Rager, set a course 259 mark 318, half impulse. Aye, sir. Hold a position 500 km from the periphery of the asteroid field. Aye, sir. Difficulty getting a clear sensor reading beyond 4,000 km. The asteroids contain large quantities of meklonite. It's interfering with our scanners. I also detect traces of kephneum, a compound found in the outer shell of the parent being. It is likely the asteroids provide sustenance for this life form. We could leave the child here. It would have a food supply. Agreed. Mr. La Forge, are you ready to separate our guest from the hull? Ready, Captain. Proceed. I am deactivating the atmospheric force field now. Engineering, report. Power drain just jumped to 93 percent, sir. The offspring is emitting radio transmissions. Is it trying to communicate? Power drain increasing. Approaching auto-shutdown. Take the engines off line. Use auxiliary power only. Go to emergency level seven. Life support and critical operations only. Mr. La Forge, your status? The bay is completely depressurized, but... it's still hanging on. I am detecting other radio transmissions. Movement detected within the asteroid field. Bearing 257 mark 161. On screen. Magnify. At their current speed, sir, the entities will intercept us in... ..ten minutes, 31 seconds. Weapons status? Auxiliary power only. Two seconds' phaser fire available. Ensign, power readings. We're on auxiliary generators. Life support functioning. That's about it. Watch that console. We've got less than six minutes to get that baby off our back. Whatever we try, Junior responds by sucking up more energy. Commander, I have a thought. If you're interested. Of course. What is it? If the baby is nursing, perhaps we need to find a way to sour the milk. If we contaminate the energy he's feeding on, we could... ..make it unpalatable somehow. But the emergency generators are all we've got. And how do we keep life support? Exactly. Unless... What? Well, this is a space baby, right? These creatures are born, they live and die in interstellar space. Apparently. OK. All matter in space vibrates in a specific radiation band. 21 cm. That's good, Commander. That's very good. If we alter the power frequency so it's foreign to the life form's natural vibrations... ..it might give us enough to pour vinegar in Baby's milk. We have to be careful. Upset it and we might lose auxiliary power, too. If we're gradual enough, hopefully it'll just lose interest. La Forge to bridge. Go ahead. Captain, Dr Brahms and I have a plan. Two minutes until the creatures intercept. Captain, we're ready down here. Proceed. Lowering wavelength in the energy system now. Reading 18. 15. 13. 11. 8. 5. 3. Now at the two-centimetre level. Any reaction, bridge? Negative. I detect no reduction in the rate of energy consumption. One minute 30 seconds to intercept. Not sour enough. Leah, take it down further. Reading 1. 0.8. 0.4. 0.2. I guess it noticed what we're doing. It is emitting its transmission. Energy consumption is rising, sir. Captain, the creatures are accelerating their approach. They are changing colour. Mr. La Forge! Captain, just a little more time. Leah, nudge it down even further, toward 0.02. 30 seconds to intercept. 0.08. 0.05. 0.03. Now at 0.02 cm. Auxiliary generators losing power. The entity has disengaged, sir. Power levels are returning to normal. Start the engines and take us out of here. Aye, sir. Mr. La Forge, Dr Brahms, congratulations. You've weaned the baby. Good work. You, too. Well, yeah, I admit it. I did get a little attached to that lady in the holodeck. The computer never said I was married? I never asked. And the computer is notorious for not volunteering information. You know... I really owe you an apology. No. No, you don't. I should have told you. If you had, I wouldn't have seen the look on your face when you walked in on me, and me, in the holodeck! The look on my face? How about the look on your face? I will remember that for a long, long time. I wouldn't change a thing. Except for the way I behaved. I guess I came here with a set of preconceptions about you. Well, I guess I'm just glad I got the opportunity to get to know you. The real you. Me, too. Worf to La Forge. There is a message on subspace for Dr Brahms. Acknowledged, Worf. La Forge out. My husband. "
S4E17,"Captain's log, star date 44631.2. Proceeding through the rim of a binary star system, we may have located the USS Brittain. The science vessel failed to reach its destination and has not been heard from since a distress call 29 days ago. On screen. Magnify. That's the Brittain. There is no indication of structural damage. Engines? Propulsion systems are shut down. The ship is drifting, sir. Life-form readings? Inconclusive. Counsellor? There is life on board, but... What is it? I don't know. Something... Number One, assemble your team. Dr Crusher to transporter room three. Worf, Data. Commander. I need to come, too. There is no malfunction in any of the main systems, sir. Commander! Here's another. This was done by a phaser on a setting of six or seven. And more over here. The entire bridge crew. Whoever did this could still be on board. There is someone still alive. But he didn't kill these people... Here. I think he's Betazoid. It's alright. We're going to help you. Who did this? Who did this to you? Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission... to explore strange new worlds,... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. We've almost finished the autopsies. How long to compile the data? It's complicated. The dead were found all over the ship. Some were found barricaded in their rooms, with weapons piled around them. Others were in the corridors. They'd obviously had hand-to-hand combat. It's going to take some time to analyze and sort through the details. We've identified him as Andrus Hagen from Betazed, Scientific Advisor. He's in a profound catatonic state. I'm not getting much. A few words, disconnected phrases. I can feel his terror, but I can't get through to him. Stay with him, Counsellor. We're examining the Brittain for clues, but this is the only man left who knows what happened there. I'm here. I'm right here. Are there... .. voices? Voices? What do they say? Both things. No. No! Keep talking to me. I'll try to understand. All the engines check out perfectly. Once they're started, she can return to base on her own. Let's give it a try. Preheating injectors. Data, fuel flow? Matter valves are open and operating. Magnetic containment of antimatter pods is constant. OK, open injectors. Injectors open. There is no engine activity at all. What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. I don't understand it. Come! I've been studying the autopsy reports. The conclusion is appalling. There was no outside source, no alien presence. All 34 of them appear to have killed each other. What could have caused such an event? Drugs, virus, poison? Toxicological tests showed no unusual substances in their systems. They appear healthy but for some reason, they seemed to turn against each other, using phasers and knives and bare hands! I'd like you to see this, Captain. It's from the logs of the Brittain. Captain Zaheva's mental condition deteriorated once they were stranded. She began talking of plots and mutinies. This was the last log entry, made after they'd been adrift for over three weeks. First Officer Brink and his men were behind it. They got to the engines. They don't work any more. Had to eliminate Brink. The ship is out of... out of... We're running out! Too dangerous! Out of Brink! And his men! Eyes in the dark. One moon. Where are you? I'm coming. Where are you? Eyes... in the dark. One moon. Eyes... in the dark. One moon circles. See the eyes... in the dark... One moon... Where are you? Captain's log, star date 44635. 8. Four days later, we've made little progress in solving the mystery. I have decided to return to Star base 220. To that end Cmdr La Forge is rigging the Brittain for towing. I'm gonna try... recalibrating the field generators. But I can't see why we can't get the engines started? It doesn't make any sense! Someone's still here. What? Can't you hear it? There's someone still alive on the ship! I... heard... I mean I thought l... heard something. The ship was searched thoroughly. There's nobody left on board. Sorry, sir. My mistake. Don't worry about it. There were 34 people found dead on this ship. That's enough to make anybody uneasy. Thank you, sir. I'm here. Can you hear me? Tell me about the voices you hear. Bright. Bright... out there. I don't understand. Bright what? Tell me more. Boy, what a day this was! I'm doing a study on Cardelia populations, but they have weird polymorphisms. What a headache! Is that why you're late? No, I was talking with Dr Balthus. She wants to do a study on the Kaladian thorn flower. But I don't have time to oversee another project! Was Tom Corbin there? What? Tom Corbin from the science lab. Remember him? Of course. But... You use any excuse to visit him! Miles, what are you saying? I think you know what I'm saying. If I didn't know better, I'd say you were jealous. Do you take me for a fool? Hello, Chief. Having coffee? No, I'm drinking too much coffee. I'm surprised to see you. Why's that? Usually newlyweds can't keep their hands off each other. She has work to do. She heads the biology lab, you know! Any strange things going on down there? Like what? I've been hearing things. Kenicki in Engineering told me he saw a man in an old Starfleet uniform riding the lift. When the lift got to the top, there was no one on it. Ghost stories! There's lots more! Strange things are happening on this ship. I'm surprised at you, Gillespie, a Starfleet officer! I have more things to worry about than shades and spirits! Come! Come! Yes, yes! Come! What... ! Captain, do you have a moment? We're concerned. Whatever happened on the Brittain may be starting here. Explain. Well, Beverly and I have been getting unusual reports. People behaving strangely, hearing sounds that aren't there. We're talking about hallucinations? Sometimes. Also erratic behaviour. We can't track down any element that might be responsible. But everything started when we found the Brittain? Captain, we must get the Enterprise away from here before it gets worse. We're taking the Brittain in tow. We'll leave within the hour. Ensign, manoeuvre us into tractor-beam range. Aye, sir. Is there a problem, Ensign? I can't seem to remember how to enter the coordinates. Ensign Lin? Ready now, Captain. Report to sickbay, Ensign Rager. Ready tractor beam, Mr. Worf. Captain, thrusters are losing power. Impulse engines. Ahead, minimum power. Impulse engines not responding. Geordi, what's going on? I don't know. Nothing's responding. Warp engines, factor one. Engage. Captain, we don't have warp drive, either. We have no functional propulsion? No, sir. Apparently, we do not. We're adrift. Just like the Brittain. Captain's log, star date 44639.9. The Enterprise has been adrift for ten days. We have sent distress calls, but being so remote, we cannot expect a response for two weeks. After analyzing the sensor logs of both ships, as well as data from the last series of probes, I conclude we are trapped in a massive rupture in space, which absorbs energy. You mean a Tyken's rift? A what? A rare anomaly, named after Bela Tyken, who first encountered it. Tyken's rift. That explains why we don't have engine power. The ships energy drains into the rift before we can use it. I was detained. When Tyken was trapped in the rift, his analysis determined that a massive energy release might overload and dislocate the anomaly. His cargo included anicium and yurium, which he used to detonate the explosion. He escaped through the ruptured centre of the rift. We have nothing to produce that kind of explosion. Not even our torpedoes. Can we replicate Tyken's elements? No, sir. We no longer have the power to replicate complex elements. We must generate an energy release without using conventional means. Data, did Tyken's crew exhibit behavioural changes? No, there were no reports of unusual conduct. Nightmares? There were no records of sleep disturbances, Counsellor. Then, what is it? What's happening to us? The only one who doesn't seem affected is Data. Bridge! Number One, how...? Sir? Any hallucinations, nightmares? No. I'd be a liar if I said I felt like myself. I've had to bite my tongue to keep from snapping at people. Couple of times, I've gone to my quarters and felt as if there was someone else there... waiting for me. I've had similar feelings. With everyone succumbing it's important that one of us try to keep control of his faculties. Turn in, take a nap. I'll be on the bridge. Relieve me in four hours. Yes, sir. Deck eight! No! Sir? As you were. Mr. Data, will you join me in my ready room? Cmdr La Forge and I have a potential solution to our predicament. The modifications used to increase fire power against the Borg could be effective here. Channelling power to the main... deflector dish? Yes, sir. In six hours we could generate a concentrated burst of energy which might disrupt the Tyken's rift. Very well. Proceed. Mr. Data? Yes, sir? It appears that I am not... immune to the strange forces that are at work on this ship. Yes, sir. It's a terrifying prospect, to lose control of one's mind. When I was... young... ..l remember watching my... grandfather deteriorate from a powerful, intelligent figure to a... frail wisp of a man, who could barely make his own way home. Mr. Data, it is my responsibility, somehow, to see that this ship is guided to safety. I will need to rely on you from now on. We may need to count on you for our very survival. I will do my best, sir. I'd like to do more cross-sections on brain tissue. Set up the positron-emission sensor. I'll decide which ones to study. Yes, Doctor. Go... away. Captain, let me ask you this. Since we located the Brittain, can you remember any of your dreams? I hardly ever recall dreams. Most people don't. But think! Have you even had a dream in the last ten days? I don't recall. I'm willing to bet you haven't. What's more, neither has anyone else on board. Except for Troi. I began to realize that, when she talked about having nightmares. I've... done some additional brain tissue scans on... the bodies... Some bodies from the... the... The Brittain, Doctor. Right. And I've scanned a random cross-section of our crew. They both have the same results, a unique chemical imbalance. Caused by? Dream deprivation. Every night... when we... we enter into... sleep... I believe what the Doctor means is that humans enter into what is known as REM sleep, rapid eye movement. It is the level of brain activity at which one dreams. We have to dream in order to survive. If we don't reach REM sleep, we don't dream, we lose our cognitive abilities, we find it hard to concentrate. We forget how to do the most ordinary task. Then we become irritable, paranoid. Some people experience hallucinations. You're describing the situation on this ship. But Counsellor Troi reported nightmares. Maybe it's because she's Betazoid. I don't know why. But I know there's more going on here than being caught in a Tyken's rift. And I don't know how or why it's happening. But I do know this. There is an inevitable conclusion to this pattern. And if I can't find a way to stop it, we will all go insane. Eyes in the dark. One moon circles. Where are you? Eyes in the dark. One moon circles. I'm still here. I haven't gone anywhere. Do you remember anything more? Double... Double... What does that mean? Is something doubled? Deanna, nothing's working. Somatic drugs, theta waves induced into the entorhinal cortex, No matter what I do, no one can reach REM sleep, no one can dream. Except for you. Except me. And... all I have is nightmares. I can hardly sleep at all any more. In the end, I'll be like him. Just like him. I think it's some kind of experiment. Capt Picard is trying to see how long we'll take it, stuck here like rats. You couldn't be more wrong. It's like we're laboratory animals. I don't wanna sit waiting for death. What does that mean? You heard about the Brittain. Shut in their rooms, dying alone. Not me! I'd rather go out fighting. OK. All power has been channelled to the... the... The main deflector dish. Yes! Right! The deflector dish... So... What do we do now? Data to bridge. Mr. Worf, activate the deflector. Aye, sir. Deflector power banks approaching maximum. Discharge in 15 seconds. Data, this detonation better work. We're not gonna last much longer. Discharge in three seconds... ..two... one. Nothing. It just fizzled out. Captain, the energy output has been absorbed into the rift. Can we try again? No, sir. Drawing more power risks the life-support systems. Understood. Keep me apprised Commander. Worf, no! You will not stop me. Security, Worf's quarters! No one can stop me! Why? What is it? I am no longer a warrior. I am no longer strong! I... I feel... What? What do you feel? I feel fear. To admit that you're afraid gives you strength. Something is waiting for us. I am not strong enough to fight it! No, Worf. It's just an illusion. It's not real! Please... put down the knife. Counsellor? It's alright. Everything's fine, thank you. Let me take you to sickbay. Acting Captain's log, star date 44642. 1. I have assumed command at Captain Picard's request. Our situation is deteriorating. Many of the crew cannot function.  Once before, you said ""double"". What did you mean? What is ""double""? Mates... too bright! Twin... cannot leave the twin! One moon... circling. What do you mean? You can't leave? No... no, please! Can't... You want to leave. Why can't you? Can't go. Help! One moon... circling. Eyes... That's it! Eyes... in the dark! Eyes in the dark. That's what the voice said in my dream. Is that where you heard it? In a dream? Over and over? Beverly, I know what it is! I know what's happening! What? My nightmare. It's not a dream. It's not a dream at all! It's a message! REM sleep has a different frequency for Betazoids than for other humanoids. I believe the beings are using that frequency to communicate telepathically. It is possible that this telepathic communication is creating interference in the REM sleep of other species. That is why the crew is not dreaming. Counsellor, what are these beings trying to tell us? They're calling for help. I think they're trapped just like we are. ""Eyes in the dark"" could mean this twin star system. Your hypothesis is certainly plausible. There may be another ship, on the other side of the fissure, undetected. Is there a way of blocking their signals? There is no technology to block telepathic transmissions. Maybe communication through dreams can work both ways. I could try stopping them. Perhaps we could accomplish more than that. If there is another ship and we can reach them, we could coordinate our efforts to free ourselves. It is conceivable. Working with patients with debilitating nightmares, I've often used a therapy called ""directed dreaming"". Dreamers can learn to control their dreams, retain a conscious memory, even while in REM sleep. I could remember a short message, and deliver it to them. If it were possible, what would you say? Working together with the aliens, we must find a way of producing an explosion stronger than either of us could make alone. What is it you're looking for? These are the elements available. Some could be used in the creation of an explosion. If we could communicate this list to the other ship... No, Data, no. This is too complex. It has to be a simple, clear message. I'm uncertain that a simple transmission would be adequate. Stop. Go back. Further back. There! Stop! One moon circles. Yes, Counsellor. One electron circles one proton. This is a hydrogen atom. One moon circles, that's what they told me, over and over. The aliens may be thinking as we are, to cooperate in making an explosion. If hydrogen mixes, for example, with calendenium, it can be very volatile. But would the message mean that they have hydrogen or they want hydrogen? Well, if it's a distress call, I think they'd ask for what they need, not what they already have. Then we should release hydrogen into the rift, hoping they are able to detonate it. How do I tell them what to do? If you are correct, they have already told us what to do, and are waiting for us to do it. When we are ready, the only message you should attempt to convey is ""Now!"" I can help keep you in REM sleep for a while with this cortical scanner. It will maintain electrical activity in your brain at the right frequency. Counsellor, you must communicate with the other ship within two minutes of REM sleep. Two minutes! Is that all, Data? Unfortunately, yes. We have only enough power to emit hydrogen for that long. They must also detonate it immediately. Captain? We are ready to implement the plan. Proceed. We have to draw power from the life-support systems in order to discharge the collectors. This is Acting Captain Data. All personnel will report to the designated shelter areas immediately. Life-support systems will continue only in emergency shelter areas. Hear that? Get us jammed into shelter areas. We sit and wait to die. Nobody will ever find us. Relax, Gillespie! Everybody relax! Ten-forward is a designated shelter area. Relax! Do we wanna die here like helpless children? Security to ten-forward immediately. What are we dying for? Sit down! You're not helping. What's wrong with standing up for ourselves? Picard owes us some answers! What is that? A little souvenir from Magus III. That was setting number one. Anyone want to see number two? PGO signals... steady. Visual cortex showing increased activity. Rapid eye movements commencing. Crusher to bridge. She's in REM sleep. Thank you, Doctor. Activating Bussard collectors. Where are you? 90 seconds remaining. One moon... ..circles... Where are you? I have to find you. ..in the dark... I have to tell you! 45 seconds remaining. One moon... Please! I must find you... to tell you! 30 seconds remaining. Eyes... in the dark... One moon... 10 seconds remaining. Nothing... No explosion... Counsellor was unsuccessful. Activate impulse engines. Engines activated, sir. We have cleared the rift, sir. Warp engines are coming back on line. Set a course to... Setting a course for Star base 220. Sir? As my final duty as Acting Captain, I order you to bed. I shall do the same for all personnel. Very well, Mr. Data. And Mr. Data... Thank you. Pleasant dreams, sir. "
S4E18,"Tarchannen III investigation, star date 40164.7. Ensign Anthony Brevelle recording. Lt Susanna Leijten in command. You up and running, Brevelle? Yes. I checked buildings four and five. Just like the others. No phaser hits, no sign of a fight, it's like the outpost just vanished. You'd better come see this. No footprints, no vehicle tracks. The wind probably erased them. But look... Freeze visual. That's Hickman on the right, Mendez on the left. As noted, the recording was made by Ensign Brevelle five years ago. You said before Brevelle deserted Star base 112 last week, he'd been ill for several days. What about Mendez? Mendez was seen on the Aries an hour before she disappeared. According to witnesses, she seemed normal. And Hickman? He just passed a routine physical on Alia IV with flying colours. No, wait, I know Paul Hickman. He's a family man with two kids. He wouldn't steal a shuttle and desert. He was spotted by a supply ship yesterday, on course to Tarchannen III. The original disappearances were never solved? No. We never learned what happened or why. 49 people, gone. And five years later the away team investigating their disappearances have started to disappear themselves. Geordi and I are the only two left. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, star date 44664.5. We have set a course to intercept Lt Hickman's stolen shuttlecraft, and, hopefully, to discover the whereabouts of the missing officers. And then, I almost married Paul Bogrow. Bogrow? Bogrow, now, which one was he? You remember. The one with the thin moustache. Not Bogrow! I know. The one who always used to drive you crazy? You always thought he was so full of himself. Well, I decided that I had prejudged him unfairly. And then I decided that I'd been right in the first place. What about you? I enjoy the bachelor's life too much. Doesn't sound like my little brother who always wanted advice on women. Yeah, obviously you were a... a great advisor. Well, Suz... What do you think? I don't know. But I'm not ashamed to tell you, I'm a little scared, you know? Yeah,... I know. If anyone can figure this out, it'll be the Leijten and La Forge show. Yeah. We always made a good team. A hell of a team. Cmdr La Forge, Cmdr Leijten, to the bridge. We have a fix on the missing shuttle. On our way, Commander. Entering the Tarchannen system. Slow to impulse power. Mr. Worf? Long-range sensors holding on the shuttle, bearing 010 mark 271. Hail the vessel. Lt Hickman does not respond, sir. Put a repeating message on all channels. Order him to come about and stand to. Priority one. Still no response, sir. The craft is now in visual range. On screen. The shuttle is accelerating. Its trajectory is moving directly into the planet's atmosphere. He will reach an atmospheric interface at an altitude of 210 kms. If he stays at that speed, he'll self-destruct. Correct, Commander. How soon, Mr. Data? 53 seconds, sir. Options? He's out of transporter range. He's too far away to get a lock with the tractor beam. Open a channel. Open. Lt Hickman, listen carefully. This is Capt Picard of the Enterprise. You are in danger. Slow your rate of approach. The shuttle is approaching the outer thermosphere. He's panicking. At current acceleration, the shuttle will be destroyed in 28 seconds. 16 seconds to impact. Lt Hickman, do what I tell you. Reduce velocity, bring your craft to a positive pitch of 20 degrees. Now! The shuttle is entering the lower ionosphere. Sensors detect two more Federation shuttlecraft on the surface. No life signs. Number One, prepare your away team. Worf, Data, Geordi. I'd like to volunteer to join you, sir. Commander. Leijten, Geordi, check the shuttle. Data, Worf, you've got the perimeter. It's the shuttle pod Mendez stole from the Aries. No life signs, Commander. Sir, I am certain we are being watched. Cmdr Riker. Found it in the shuttle. Where's Cmdr Leijten? Riker to Susanna, report. Fan out. Let's find her. Susanna! La Forge to Leijten. Over here. Where have you been? Mendez and Brevelle are alive. You saw the footprints? Yeah. But they're not human. They're here. Just stand still and listen. You can feel it. They're here. I'm not picking up anything. Wait a minute. Where are you going? Stay away! Suz,... La Forge to Enterprise, medical emergency. Two to sickbay! Do I look as bad as I feel? You look fine... now. What happened? Your blood chemistry is way off. You had a histamine response. To what, I don't know. I'm running a blood and tissue analysis. I need to get back to the surface. Until I have some answers, I don't want you to leave the Enterprise. I have work to do. Look, Commander, you may have just had an anxiety reaction down there, but I've got to know for sure. Might not be such a bad idea to take it easy. I won't stay locked up on this ship while the investigation's going on. Your devotion to duty is admirable, but Dr Crusher is right, you'll remain on board until we know if this is connected with the disappearances. Captain... We've surveyed the surface. Analyzing all that data will keep us busy for a while. Yes, sir, I understand. Data's got a preliminary report if you're up to it. Sure. Let's get going. What about La Forge? I gave him a complete bioscan. The results say he's in perfect shape. That's what the reports said about Mendez and Hickman before they disappeared. Capt Picard's wrong. The best way is to go back with a dozen away teams, fan out from the shuttle, cover a lot of ground fast. Use proximity detectors, sensors... Susanna. It's started! What if what happened to the others is happening to me? You don't know that. Suz, I'm here and I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, OK? OK. Come on. During examination of the torn uniform, I discovered these alien skin cells. Source? Undetermined. Without something to compare, it'll take weeks to identify them. Fortunately, we have more evidence. We determined that these footprints were not made by any known Tarchannen life form. If we're pursuing a theory that somehow unknown aliens are involved, I should tell you that we didn't find tracks like that during the original investigation. The planet has frequent sandstorms. Prints might have been obliterated prior to your arrival. Dr Crusher and I will search the medical database in an attempt to match these with some known life form. Aliens or no aliens, why would our people return after five years, to be abducted? Some sort of compulsion, like a post-hypnotic command. Something that happened while we were there before? We can take the records and chart everyone's movements. Look for some commonality, something we all touched. Maybe... a plant, or... the sand. Or even something we ingested. It could even be in the air itself. The parameters are broad, Data. Any match we make will be inconclusive at best. I am aware of that. I see no other reasonable course of investigation available to us. We may not have much time. You're worried about Geordi, aren't you? I am an android. It is not possible for me... For you to feel anxiety. Starfleet personnel have vanished. Others may be at risk. We must try to find out why. However, I am... ..strongly motivated to solve this mystery. Ensign Hickman. Freeze visuals. We're wasting our time. That's not how you felt before. It was your idea to look for a commonality. Yeah, well, I was wrong. We're not going to find anything this way. We should go back to the planet. It's all down there, everything we need to know. That's just not an option. At least, not until Capt Picard says it is. Computer, resume. I can't look at that any more. It hurts my eyes. I can't think. My mind feels like it's wrapped up in a blanket. Take a break. I'll work on this. I don't need a break! I need to get off the ship. Susanna, why don't we... go and see Dr Crusher? Forget Crusher and forget your logs! Tarchannen's down there, Geordi. It's waiting for us. That's where we should go. Susanna,... you can't leave. Susanna! Blood pressure's still falling. Apply T-cell stimulator. We have got to stabilize her immune system. She has developed an extreme sensitivity to light. We're trying to make her comfortable. Oh,... God! Geordi? Susanna,... ..hold on. OK? Dr Crusher... will help you, ..so... just hold on. It's inside of me, Geordi. I can't fight it. It's winning. Don't give up. Do you hear me? You can't give up, Suz. This is one of Susanna's altered skin cells and an alien cell Data found. Almost identical. How do you explain that? The people from Tarchannen III who disappeared weren't abducted. I think they were transformed into another species. Can you stop it? The T-cell stimulator will slow down the rate of change, but until I find the cause... Is the Enterprise at risk? No. I checked the cell-wall integrity. Its viability is low. I don't think she can transmit it. Then how did she get it? I wish I knew. The only thing I do know, Geordi,... ..is that it's very possible that you will be next. But... I had two full bioscans today. You said I was fine. I gave Susanna a bioscan, too. I didn't find anything wrong with her. How long? Brevelle was sick for days before he left. Mendez was normal an hour before she disappeared. You may have weeks or very few hours. Then there's no time to waste. I should get back to work. Geordi, until I know what we're dealing with, I think you should stay here in sickbay. You said that it would help if you knew the source. If I continue analyzing the records, I might find an answer. Mr. La Forge,... what if you begin to change? What if you feel compelled to go down to the planet? Program the computer to monitor my movements. That way we can be sure that I don't leave the ship. What would you do, Captain? Would you sit it out here in sickbay, or try to learn what it is that's got you, and maybe stop it? Very well. You proceed with your investigation, but report for a bioscan at the start of the day watch. Aye, sir. Geordi, if you have symptoms of any kind, I want to know immediately. Understood. One to transport. I'll make another sweep. La Forge, building four. Mendez and Brevelle, two. I'll take five. Alright, Computer, analyze audio elements from time index 1447 to 1558. List all anomalies. No audio anomalies present. Any subspace projections? Z-particle emissions? Interferometric frequencies? No subspace projections present. No Z-particle emissions present. No interferometric patterns present. Damn! May I ask how your investigation is proceeding? It's not. You attempted an audio analysis? Yes, Data. And a spectrographic analysis, and a screen for ionising radiation. I even ran an enhancement for micro-seismic disturbances. I've tried it all, OK? I'm sorry. There is no need for an apology. Perhaps if you indulged in a brief rest period, you could approach this problem with a fresh point of view. You're probably right, but I've got to keep scanning these records while I can. May I assist you? If I knew what I was looking for. Really, Data,... I think it's just a matter of me going over it, maybe finding something I forgot. I'll let you know if I come across anything. Alright, Computer. One more time. Sorry to disturb you... What's happened? I thought you should see this. Her skin is simulating light! A radiant reaction. Some sort of mimetic ability? That's not all. Her body temperature is dropping. It's as if she's generating a disruptive field. I can barely get any readings off her. Her rate of transformation? Increasing. Impossible! It should have been inhibited by the T-cell stimulator. Unless... If there's a foreign body inside her that's producing these changes, something like a viral créche. A very small one if our scans haven't found it. I want a full genetic analysis. We'll examine any abnormality, no matter how insignificant it seems. One to transport. Computer, delete the audio. Wait a minute. Freeze visual. Whose shadow is that? Please restate question. Computer, the shadow currently displayed in section B-3, what is its source? Unknown. Come on, it's gotta belong to somebody. Computer, replay a visual of the last time index. No audio,... and slow to 50 percent. OK. Brevelle's behind the camera. Susanna and I head off in that direction. Mendez moves off that way. Freeze visual. Now,... magnify four times. And spectrally enhance those shadows. Do you have sufficient data to compile a holographic simulation? A simulation would be limited to areas scanned by the recording. Fine. Scan the entire record and recreate it on holodeck three. Computer, is the Tarchannen simulation ready? Affirmative. Program complete. Enter when ready. Computer,... scan Starfleet records and create a simulation of Brevelle. Place him where he was while recording this. OK. Good. Computer, based on their speed and direction, can you extrapolate each one's movements as they walk out of the recording device's field of view? Affirmative, with an increasing probability of error reaching 95 percent after ten seconds. Understood. Run simulation. I want to make another sweep. La Forge, building four. Mendez and Brevelle, two. I'll take five. Computer, freeze. It's all happening too fast. Computer, reverse simulation. Run it back to time index 1472. Freeze program. Computer,... remove La Forge. And... now remove Leijten. And now... remove Mendez. Computer, using vector analysis, identify the source of this shadow. There is no object in the program which could generate the shadow. There... ..there has to be something between the camera light and this wall. Computer,... ..given the distance between the light and the wall, can you determine the most likely shape and position of the object causing this shadow? Insufficient data to reconstruct the requested object. Alright. Let's say that my friend and I here are about the same size, say... 1.7m. Now, can you extrapolate its shape and its position? Affirmative. Do it! There, in the thymus. Some sort of parasite. It's using Susanna's immune system to spread genetic instructions. How did it get there? Maybe during the original mission. It's small enough to enter through any mucous membrane. But it isn't behaving like a typical parasite. It isn't feeding off of her. It transforms her DNA to match its own. There's not much of her original DNA left. We're gonna need unaltered genes or we're never gonna get her back. We've got to get that thing out of her now. Any luck? Negative, Commander. Nothing suggests the source of a parasitic infection. Crusher to bridge. Go ahead, Doctor. The surgery was successful. It'll be a few hours before we know whether her regenerative systems are responding. In the meantime, we better get La Forge down here. Keep us informed. Crusher to La Forge. Computer, locate Cmdr La Forge. Cmdr La Forge is not on board the Enterprise. Bridge, the computer says La Forge is no longer on board. Is that correct? I am showing no transporter activity. All shuttles are secure. No indication he's left the ship. Last known location of La Forge? Holodeck three. If Geordi has transformed, he may be a chameleon. The skin develops mimetic capabilities. He may still be on board, but undetectable to our sensors. You search the structure. I will take the perimeter. Commander. Geordi's uniform. Security, intruder in transporter room six! The security lock-out on transporter room six has been broken. Re-engage now. I cannot. The transporter cycle has already begun. Captain's log, star date 44668. 1. Dr Crusher's research indicates we have less than an hour before Cmdr La Forge's transformation becomes irreversible. However, all attempts to locate him on the surface have failed. I do not read any life signs on the surface. Our sensor array is useless. We must find another way of locating him. If we can get close enough to Geordi, we can read his spectrum with an ultraviolet light. Can you modify an emergency beacon to operate on UV? Yes, sir. Make it so. As soon as Data is ready, I want you to lead an away team. Aye, sir. How long, Data? I must replace the emitter module and reconnect the power supply. It will take two minutes to complete the modifications. Hendrick to Cmdr Riker. Go ahead. I've determined La Forge's transport coordinates. He beamed down next to the Aries shuttle. Acknowledged. He's on foot. He can't have got far. Let's assume a radius of... 10 kms. That still leaves a search area of more than 300 square kilometres. We've got to narrow that down. The enhanced sensor arrays? All scans are still negative. We've got to find a way to track him. The high-resolution EM scan? We are adjusting sensors to read his absorption spectrum, but it will take several hours. Geordi doesn't have several hours! I have completed modifications. Excellent. Dr Crusher, meet us in transporter room six. He's gonna need a sedative. Give me 10 ccs of kayolane. Dr Crusher. You look a lot better than you did. What did you do? Removed a parasite from your thymus. No, it's not a parasite, Doctor. It was their method of reproduction, to plant a DNA strand in a living host that causes metamorphosis. Geordi? He's gone? Yes. Back to the planet? Stay calm. We have to find him. An away team is searching. You'll never be able to find him. I'm the only one who can. No, turn them off, the light frightens them. What about UV? Beyond their visual spectrum. They won't run away from it. He could be several kilometres away. No, he's here. They're all here. There. Geordi? Geordi, stop! No, wait. Geordi. Geordi, my voice is familiar. Listen to it. You can feel that we share this. You know I'm not a threat. The others, Mendez, Brevelle,... they don't exist as humans any more, but a part of you still does. You're not one of them yet, Geordi. I can help you if you'll just trust me. I know what's going on inside of you,... the war you're fighting with yourself, your humanity slipping away. The instinct to run, it's overpowering. But they know how to beat it now, Geordi. Look at me! I've come back, Geordi. Let me take you back, too. Just take my hand. Please. Enterprise, lock onto Cmdr Leijten's signal. Prepare to beam two to sickbay. We're going home, Geordi. Is there no hope for Brevelle or Mendez? None. Susanna. I'm right here, Geordi. So are Dr Crusher and Capt Picard. Here's your visor, Geordi. Lt Cmdr La Forge reporting for duty, Captain. Welcome back, Mr. La Forge. Geordi, this species, can you communicate with it? No. They... act on instinct alone. In another few minutes, I wouldn't have responded to you, Susanna. Then we will leave them be. I'll order warning beacons placed in orbit and on the surface, so no one else goes through what you did. You know,... down there, l... didn't know who you were. And yet,... somehow,... ..l believed you, I trusted you. That must have been because of all the good advice I used to give you. Thanks. "
S4E19,"You were like a brother to me. Do you remember, we used to play in the park near the lake? Yes, of course. Every summer, you would come to Bergerac. You made swords out of the reeds. And when you cut your hand, you would run to me, and I would say, ""Let me see."" Oh, how did you do that? Playing near the Port de Nesle! And how many did you play against? No more than a hundred. Tell me! No. Let it go. What? Let it go. Let it go. Let... Let it go. You... tell me what you were going to say. Do you dare? I do dare. I love someone. He does not know. Not yet. But he is proud, noble, brave and beautiful! Beautiful? What's the matter? With me? Nothing. It is my hand. He is in the Guards? Since this morning. Baron Christian de Neuvillette. In your own regiment. Promise me... Promise me... to be his friend? I promise. I love you! I must go now. And tell him to write me. A hundred men! What courage! Oh, but l... I have done better since. Well done. Bravo. Very good. Bravo! Wonderful! Bravo! Lt Barclay's performance was adequate, but clearly not of the Method approach. I do not understand... Data, because it's polite. Good job, Reg. And only... what, six weeks of lessons? Good job, period. I... we have a patient teacher. I have an opening in my workshop. Well done. Thank you,... Counsellor. You've come a long way, Reg. After... more rehearsals than I can count. I don't just mean your acting ability. It takes a lot of courage to put yourself on display like that. You... you think so? There was a time when nothing could have dragged you on-stage in front of an audience. You've made tremendous progress. I... I guess. Don't you think so? Well,... I just feel more comfortable... playing somebody else. Maybe all of this is not any better than escaping into a holodeck fantasy. I disagree. This isn't fantasy, it's theatre. You used to withdraw onto the holodeck and isolate yourself inside your imagination, avoiding contact with real people. Look at yourself now. Look at all the other people you're with. You're not just acting, you're interacting. Give yourself some credit, Mr. Barclay. Maybe... you're right. Captain's log, star date 44704.2. We have arrived at the Argus Array, a remote subspace telescope at the very edge of Federation space. The unmanned structure stopped relaying its data two months ago. The reactors that power the Array are very unstable. There is a risk of overload. The computer systems? They do not seem to be functioning at all. I am picking up an unidentified device 1.8 kms from the Array. On screen. Magnify. That's some kind of probe. I bet that's what damaged the Array. Is it emitting any signals, Lieutenant? Negative, sir. I show no activity. Mr. La Forge, go out and take a closer look. Aye, sir. Lt Barclay, report to the main shuttle bay. Enterprise, shuttle five ready to begin a short-range scan. Proceed. Begin with the high-res series. Electromagnetic band? Give it a try. I'm picking up visual wavelengths only between 4,500 and 7,000 angstroms. Let's try the neutron densitometer. Nothing. Doesn't wanna give up any of its secrets. Let's go to an active scan. No... no modulation. Really? You are definitely not from our neighbourhood. Increase to 3.0. Commander? Yeah, Reg? Thanks for... assigning me to this mission. Don't mention it. You're one of my top engineers. It's time you got in on some of the interesting stuff. This... this is why I'm in Starfleet. There's still no modulation. Hit it with a positron emission. What was that? Computer's down, Reg! Reg...? Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise,... ..its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, supplemental. An energy surge from the probe has disabled the shuttle's computer. The away team are now in sickbay where Lt Barclay remains under observation. Any indication of the probe's energy source? No, sir. Emissions do not match any known radiation patterns. We have not encountered this technology before. Place the probe in tow. We'll take it to Science Station 402. Captain, the probe has begun to move. It is approaching the Enterprise. Shields up. Aye, sir. That flash overloaded your optic nerves. It knocked you unconscious. My visor must have filtered it out. Exactly. There was no retinal damage and the cornea's fine. But I'm waiting for a sero-amino read-out. I'll call you when it comes in. I'd like this done as quickly as possible. You shouldn't have to wait too long for the results. What do you mean? Use a global mode in your scanner. It would be a lot faster. That's not possible. We're talking about human cells, not isolinear circuits. I think you better stick to engineering. A cell has an electromagnetic signature, just like a circuit. Theoretically, it should work with just a few adjustments. I could set it up, if you'd like. Probe now closing at 15.3 metres per second. Collision course. Sensors read no particulate emissions or subspace field distortions. Then, how does it move? Method of propulsion is unknown. Take us away from it. One-quarter impulse. Aye, sir. The probe is matching our speed. Captain, an energy field is forming around the device. Intensity is 3.2 terawatts and increasing. Sir, the shuttlecraft's shields did not protect its computer. Ours may be vulnerable. I recommend withdrawal to a safe distance. Ensign, full about. Half impulse. One-half impulse. The probe is following. Options, Number One? Photon torpedoes this close are out. The explosion could cripple us. Sir, recommend full phasers. Proceed. Firing phasers. No effect, Captain. The probe's field intensity is building. We are in danger. La Forge, can you increase phaser power? Attempting to now, Commander. Isolate phasers 80 to 120. Shunt all plasma... To the emitters. Yes, sir, I'm already on it. Ready. Phasers are as hot as we can make them. Mr. Worf? Aye, sir. Nothing. Go to warp two. Aye, sir. Warp two. The probe is still with us, sir. At warp two? Yes, sir. The probe's energy output is overloading our shields. Failure anticipated in 47 seconds. I'm willing to take suggestions. We are dropping to impulse! Warp power's been transferred to the shield grid. Yeah, but by whom? Barclay! What are you doing? Lt Barclay to Capt Picard. Fire photon torpedoes, maximum yield, full spread. We're too close. I'm certain the shields will hold. Mr. La Forge? I don't know how he did it, but shield strength has been increased by 300 percent! It should be enough, Captain. Photon torpedoes, maximum yield, full spread. Aye. Thank you, Mr. Barclay. You're welcome, Captain. Barclay out. I'm sorry if l... overstepped my authority. Don't mention it. Captain's log, star date 44705.3. The Enterprise has destroyed the probe, but now we face the difficult task of repairing the Argus telescope. Failure to do so would represent an incalculable scientific loss. Mr. Barclay. Everyone's still trying to figure out how you did it? It occurred to me to set up a frequency harmonic between the deflector and shields, using the warp-field generator. And that naturally created an amplification of the energy output. I see that. Glad you could join us, Mr. Barclay. Your report, Mr. La Forge. Each of the telescope's antennae is powered by its own fusion reactor, but a single computer controls them all. All 18 reactors were affected? That's right. They're starting to overload and could go critical. The explosion will destroy the Array. I wouldn't want to be nearby. A standard isolation procedure is advisable. I agree. We'll cut off each reactor and repair them one by one. How long will that take? Two to three weeks. Alright, Mr. La Forge. I don't agree. We could repair all of the reactors simultaneously, not one by one. Simultaneously? All 18? Yes, sir. But the computer is inoperable. Not entirely, the core memory is still intact. We could program a new control system. An interesting suggestion, however, that would require much more time than our original plan. At least seven weeks. I could have it ready for you in two days. What? If you could assist me, Commander. Sure, Reg! The moon,... yes, that'll be my home, my paradise. I shall find there all the souls that I love. Socrates,... Galileo. And when I arrive, they will question my worthiness. ""What the devil is he doing there among us?"" Philosopher, scientist, poet, musician, duellist! Here lies Hercule Savinien de Cyrano de Bergerac! I would not have you weep any less for that charming, good... and handsome Christian. I only ask this,... that as the great cold surrounds my bones, you allow a double meaning... for your mourning veil. And when you let fall your tears for him, some few... will be for me. That was a real improvement. Same time, day after tomorrow? Same time. Reg? May I join you? Of course. Please. Sit down, Counsellor. Hard at work? Preparing for tomorrow's meeting. We're planning our repair strategy. I really enjoyed the scene you just performed. You're a very forgiving audience. Not at all. I thought you were brilliant. You've changed. Is that a professional opinion? Pure observation. No, it's true. I can't explain it. In the past few days, I've found confidence... ..l never knew was there. I'm proud of you, Reg. I'm glad for you, too. Well,... I'd better be going. Must you? I think so. Would you like to take a walk with me through the arboretum? The zalnias should be in bloom. Reg, as your former counsellor,... ..l don't think it would be appropriate. I don't need a counsellor. What I need is the company of a charming, intelligent woman. Good night, Mr. Barclay. Where's Lt Barclay? I stopped by his quarters on my way over. He wasn't there. Computer, location of Lt Barclay. Lt Barclay is on holodeck three. G,... sub l, J... of t, as t... approaches... infinity. G of t... over G-nought. So it is! How will you incorporate quantum principle into general relativity without adjusting the cosmological constant a lot more than you do here? If we increase the value as you suggest, we must face the possibility of 26 dimensions instead of ten. I don't think I could deal with that. I certainly could not. If the semi set curved into the subatomic,... the infinities might cancel each other out. They just might! We had a meeting, at 0700. I'm sorry, Commander. Thank you, Professor. End program. What was that all about? I had some ideas last night, I needed to consult the computer about some quantum calculations. An Einstein program seemed the best way. I went a little overboard. A little? The stuff on that board was out of my league. Yours, too. No, I just hadn't thought along those lines. It's evident now. If you put your mind... Reg, ever since we met that probe, something's different about you. What? Because I'm behaving like the rest of the crew? With confidence? You just spent the entire night arguing grand unification theories with Einstein! Yes, but... Reg! Something's happened to you. And we can't ignore that. Yes, I've finally become the person I've always wanted to be. Do we have to ask why? Yeah, I think we do. Incredible! The production of neurotransmitters in your brain has jumped over 500% . Synaptic membranes have increased permeability. I couldn't even guess at your IQ level now. Somewhere between 1200 and 1450. But that isn't all. The corpus callosum connecting both sides of the brain is so active now that the hemispheres are behaving as one. So, it's not just raw intelligence we're talking about? No. Creativity, resourcefulness, inspiration, imagination, they've all been enhanced. Lieutenant,... you could very well be the most advanced human being who has ever lived. Whatever that probe did to him, Barclay now knows more about the Enterprise than anyone on board. The question is, how are we going to deal with it? We could confine him to quarters. How can we do that? What's he done? We'd be locking a man up for being too smart. He's been influenced by an alien, that puts us at risk. Not necessarily. It might be like an allergic reaction to a bee sting. Has Mr. Barclay done anything that could be considered threatening? Well, he did make a pass at me last night. A good one. I'd hardly consider that a threat. No, but it's certainly unusual behaviour for Barclay. There's something else, Captain. He taught violin technique at the music school last night. I didn't know Barclay played the violin. He didn't, not until last night. Look, if we want to save the Array, we need him. It's as simple as that. Until he does something more menacing, I see no reason why we should prevent him from continuing his work. Larson to Cmdr La Forge. Go ahead, Lieutenant. We have trouble with reactor nine, it's starting to chain. I'm on my way. You said he made a pass at you, but you failed to mention if he succeeded. Thermal levels up 177 percent. Comparable neutron emissions. Is the interface between the computer and Array working? Yes, but our computer is too slow to direct the repairs. The parameters are changing too fast. We'll try a remote shut-down from here. Transmitting commands to the Array. Starting close-down. Increase the intake of liquid helium. We've got to cool this off. Transmitting commands. Thermal levels increasing, sir. What happened? The interface isn't fast enough! Cmdr La Forge, overload indications on Argus generator 5, 7 and 14. Damn! I can't do anything from here. I have to find a better interface. Bridge. We're looking at a cascade reactor failure on the Argus. I don't think we can pull this one out. Reactor nine will reach critical in ten minutes, 43 seconds. The explosion will create a chain reaction along the entire length of the Array. Stand by for a jump to warp two. Yes, sir. La Forge, you've got ten minutes. Red alert. Aye, Commander. Computer, begin new program. Create as follows, workstation chair. Now, a standard alphanumeric console positioned for the left hand. Now an iconic display console positioned for the right hand. Tie both consoles into main computer utilizing neural-scan interface. There is no such device on file. No problem. Here's how you build it. Argus reactor nine, 28 seconds to critical. Get us out of here. Warp two. Helm's not responding, sir. Captain, we have lost computer control. What? 12 seconds to critical. Go to manual. I'm attempting to, but... There's not enough time. Computer is coming back on line. Captain,... ..the Argus reactors are shutting down. We are no longer in danger, sir. What happened? Unknown, sir. Geordi, what did you do? It wasn't me, sir. Computer, how were the Argus reactors shut down? A neural interface was created to do the repairs. Barclay? Computer, respond. I am responding, sir. I'm sorry if I caused alarm. It was necessary in order to secure the Array. Barclay! Barclay, what's going on? Yes, Commander, it's me. I'm sorry, Captain, I was only trying to help. Our computer was too slow to compensate for the overload, so I created an interface that communicated my thoughts directly to the central processing unit. Exactly what does that mean? My body is as you see it here, but much of my higher brain functions have been transferred to the starboard computer core. Mr. Barclay, remove yourself from the computer system. I'm afraid I can't do that, sir. And why not? My primary cerebral functions are now operating almost entirely from within the computer. They have expanded so much, it would be impossible to return to the confines of my human brain. Any attempt to do so would mean my death. That's it. I've disconnected the audio and visual pick-ups. We won't be monitored by the computer. By Barclay. Report, Mr. La Forge. It is now almost impossible to tell where Barclay ends and the computer begins. He's rewriting the isolinear chips each time he extends himself. How do we get him out? We don't, not without killing him. This is an intolerable situation. I have no wish to harm him, but I cannot allow Barclay to continue to act as the computer. I don't care how smart he is. Lt Barclay has not extended himself into the engineering subsystems. It may be possible to establish an ODN bypass directly to the bridge. That won't give us control. But we would have access to the propulsion systems, to get us to the next star base. How long would it take to set that up? A few hours. Make it so. Cmdr La Forge? Yeah, Reg? I thought you'd be in your quarters. No, I'm... just catching up on some work, you know? That level-three diagnostic we talked about. How are you doing? I wish I could convey to you what it's like for me now, what I've become. Yeah? Try. I can conceive almost infinite possibilities and fully explore each of them in a nanosecond. I perceive the universe as a single equation, and it is so simple. I understand. You understand? Everything. Well,... do you understand how this happened to you? I believe it is a gift. That I have been chosen to fulfil a great purpose. Do you suppose this has changed the way people think about me? To tell you the truth, Reg, they don't know what to think. I've been concerned about that, but soon, everyone will understand what I can do for humanity. What do you mean? We perceived the maximum speed of the ship to be a factor of warp, but I know now there are no limits. We will explore new worlds that we could never have reached in our lifetime. I will take us to them. Captain, I am picking up subspace distortion. Mr. Data? This disturbance is the result of a graviton field emanating from our warp nacelles. It is creating a severe bias in the subspace continuum. Mr. Barclay, are you responsible for this graviton-field disturbance? Yes, sir. I'm altering subspace in a way never conceived of before. It will allow us to travel halfway across the galaxy in a matter of... Stop this experiment for now. Captain, if you'd only allow... This is a direct order. Discontinue whatever you're doing. I'd really rather not, sir. I'm positive you'll be pleased with the result once I've finished... Audio's disconnected. You may speak freely. How long for the ODN process? I've been monitoring Geordi, it will be operational in 17 minutes. Captain, let me go to the holodeck and try and talk to him. Sir, the subspace distortion continues to increase. Hello, Deanna. Reg. I'm sorry we can't take that walk in the arboretum. So am l. Reg, you've frightened all of us. I'm sure that wasn't your intent. Children are sometimes frightened of the world. That doesn't mean their parents should keep them in their cribs. Are we children to you now? I can see so much more than you are capable of. You should trust that. Deanna, I've always wanted to earn your respect. You've got it, from all of us. We don't need any more convincing. Please,... obey the Captain's orders. Stop whatever it is you're doing. You must trust me. How can we trust an officer who doesn't follow orders? Trust me. The Captain will do everything in his power to stop you. Picard to La Forge. Status? Ready, Captain. Proceed. Acknowledged. Commander? What? You're too late. Captain, we have not regained control of the propulsion systems. The ODN bypass to the bridge has been blocked. Barclay. Yes, Cmdr Riker. Whatever it is you're doing out there, you've got to stop it. Sir, we're going in. Mr. Barclay, respond at once. Audio's disconnected. Take a security team to holodeck three, disconnect Mr. Barclay from the computer. Aye, Captain. I want you to know, Lt Worf, that I understand your duty here. Phasers. Maximum setting. And that I will in no way take your actions personally. Conduits. La Forge? Initiate stabilization procedure! Resetting stabilizers to match subspace flow-matrix. Stand by. He is protected by a force field! We could not disconnect him. Mr. Data? We are experiencing a quantum-model oscillation delay, doubling in intensity every... 12.3 seconds. Bio-cellular disruption is imminent! Sir. Where are we, Ensign? Unless something's wrong with our sensors, we're almost 30,000 light years from where we were. The centre of the galaxy. Our heading's been altered. Approaching planetary cluster. Captain, all systems are back under helm control. The computer has returned to normal. Captain! Emotive. Electrochemical-stimulus response. Cranial plate, bipedal locomotion, endoskeletal. Contiguous external integument! I'm Capt Jean-Luc Picard... ..of the Federation Starship Enterprise. Hierarchical collective command structure. Who are you? Interrogative! I am interrogative, yes, and I would appreciate an explanation. I think I can help you with that. Mr. Barclay. I thought it would be fatal if you left the holodeck. The Cytherians have reintegrated me. Cytherians. The probe was designed to instruct outsiders on how to reach here. Technologies are not always compatible. They failed with the Argus computer and the one on the shuttle, but they were able to reprogram me. What do you want of us? The same as you. Mr. Barclay? You're both on the same mission. Mission? Yes, sir. The Cytherians are exploring the galaxy, as we are. The only difference is that they never leave their home. They bring others... here. Their only wish? An exchange of knowledge. They want to know us. Captain's log, star date 44721.9. After ten days in the company of the Cytherians, the Enterprise has been safely returned to Federation space. We have knowledge of their race that will take our scholars decades to examine. Lt Barclay is apparently no worse for his experience. So, how much do you remember? I remember doing everything, just not how or why. How do you feel now? Smaller. Just plain old Barclay, huh? Always seems to come back to that, doesn't it? You know, almost everyone has a moment in life when they exceed their own limits, achieve what seems to be impossible. The tricky part is what happens afterwards. You almost always feel a sense of loss. But it is possible to carry that experience through your life in ways that you aren't even aware of now. I... I think I know what you're saying. Either way, Reg, you're an important part of the crew. In fact, I could use your help with that level-three diagnostic. Sure. Excuse me, but I believe Mr. Barclay and I had a date scheduled, for a walk in the arboretum? The diagnostic can wait. See you later. You really don't have to do that. I know. That was a big play. May l? Checkmate in nine moves. I didn't know you played chess. I don't. "
S4E20,"Captain's log, star date 44741.9. We have arrived at Tagus III, where the Enterprise will serve as host for the Federation Archaeology Council's annual symposium. I look forward to giving tomorrow's keynote address with great anticipation. Come! The Council members have beamed aboard and been assigned quarters. Excellent. Captain, it really is quite late. About my lecture, what do you think will give the greater clarity? A chronological structure or the division of each expedition's findings into religious, sociological and environmental sub-groupings? Didn't you decide on a chronological structure? There's something to be said for a more scientific approach. May I make a suggestion? By all means. Relax. You've written a brilliant speech. It will need to be. I'm addressing the greatest scientific minds in the Federation. Switzer, Klarc-Tarn-Droth, McFarland! Giants in archaeology! Compared to them, I'm just an amateur. I doubt they see you as an amateur. Not when it comes to Tagus III. Well, it's true, I have done my homework. I have examined the findings of every expedition conducted on the planet. It is unfortunate the Taguans no longer allow visitors to the ruins. Especially since we know so little about their origins. But I think I have constructed some plausible theories of my own. I'm sure the Council members will agree. Your support is appreciated. Now, goodnight, Captain. Bring back any memories? Vash! How did you get in here? I came in through the window. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. I had no idea you were a member of the Archaeology Council. You are a member, aren't you? More or less. Why did you come to Tagus III? To see you, of course. Is that the only reason? Isn't it enough? I wish I could believe you. I really have missed you. Excuse me. Sorry I'm late. Excuse me. I didn't realize you had company. That's alright. Let me introduce you. This is Beverly... Dr Beverly. Dr Beverly Crusher. This is Vash. A friend from the Archaeology Council. Sorry to interrupt. The Captain and I often share morning tea together. Yes, I know. Jean-Luc has told me all about you. Really? When was that? On Risa, where we met. I see! That must have been during your vacation last year. No. Yes! Yes. Well, I am surprised he didn't mention you. So am l. Doctor, are you busy? Not at the moment. I'd love to see some more of this marvellous ship. I'd be delighted to show it to you. I... That is, if it's alright with you, Jean-Luc. Of course. Don't worry. I promise to behave myself. And this is ten-forward, where the reception will be held. I can't think of a better location. Does Jean-Luc come here often? Not often. The Captain is a very private man. Would you like something to drink? Please. Eternity never looked so lovely. Excuse me? I was referring to the view. Eternity never looked so lovely. You must be Cmdr Riker. You have me at a disadvantage. I didn't mean to interrupt. I believe you were about to tell me that my eyes are as mysterious as the stars. You're Betazoid. Not at all. It's just that Jean-Luc does a very good imitation of you. He does? I see you two have met. Not exactly. This is Vash, a member of the Archaeology Council. and a friend of the Captain's. So I gather. They met on Risa. On Risa? That vacation must have been better than he let on. You mean he never mentioned me to you, either? Dr Crusher, report to sickbay. I'm afraid I won't be able to finish our tour. But perhaps Cmdr Riker could take over for me? It would be my pleasure. This is the main bridge, the command centre, and our last stop. Vash, Cmdr La Forge, Cmdr Data. Hello. How do you do? And this is Lt Worf. Hello. Something wrong? Council members have not been granted bridge clearance. We can make an exception. Vash is a guest of the Captain. Welcome aboard. Thank you. Is this where Jean-Luc sits? That's the big chair. Well, I can see where being a starship captain has its rewards. I'm glad that you approve. I'll go to my room and get ready for the reception. By all means. Well, I suppose I'll see you then... then. I'll look forward to it. Fascinating woman. I thought being ship's Counsellor meant the Captain confided in you? He does, when he thinks it's necessary. And he never spoke to you about me? Not that I recall. Not even a hint? You must understand the Captain is a very... ..private man. I know. Excuse me. Of course. Nice legs. For a human. Jean-Luc, we need to talk. Excuse me. The reception's going well. Forget that for a moment. Why have you never mentioned me to your friends? What should I have said? That we met, had an adventure together, some fun. It wouldn't be possible. Why not? It would be inappropriate. I wasn't expecting you to go into intimate details. A captain does not reveal his personal feelings to his crew. Is that a Starfleet regulation, or did you make that up yourself? I'm sorry if you're upset. And I'm sorry if I embarrass you. How was the reception? Splendid. Jean-Luc, wonderful to see you again. How about a big hug? Don't stand there. Say something. Get out of my chair! And I was hoping for something more like, ""Welcome back, Q, my old friend."" We're not friends! You wound me, mon capitaine. There. Perhaps now your manners will improve. Why are you here? Have the Continuum banished you once again? Hardly! They're still apologizing for the last time. What do you want? Do I always have to have a reason to stop by? I was merely in the sector, I was... You force a confession from me. The truth is, I have a debt to repay. A debt? To you. And it gnaws at me and it interferes with each of my days. What are you talking about? Without your assistance I would never have survived. I would have taken my life but for you. We all make mistakes. Your good deed made possible my reinstatement in the Continuum, and I resent owing you anything. So I'm here to pay up. Tell me, what is it you wish? And I'll be gone. Just be gone. That'll do nicely. No, no! It must be something more constructive. That's my new word for the day. Another time, Q. I have matters to attend to. Your speech? I read it. It's dull, plodding, pedantic, like yourself. I could help you with it. No, thank you. You've never been to the ruins at Tagus III, have you? No. They were sealed off over a century ago. Well, that explains it, then. How can you write about something that you've never seen? I know! Why don't I take you there? Out of the question. We'd be breaking Taguan law. Must you always be so ethical? We could travel back in time. You could see Tagus as it was two billion years ago. They really knew how to party back in those days. My answer is still no. My lecture will have to stand on its own. Now please leave my ship! You are the most impossible person to buy a gift for! Cmdr Riker, will you report to my ready room? Yes, Captain? I've just been paid a visit from Q. Q? Any idea what he's up to? He wants to do something nice for me. I'll alert the crew. Captain. Who's there? It's me. Who? Jean-Luc. Yes? May I come in? Let me try to explain. I... I am by no means embarrassed by your presence here. On the contrary. What's this? A map of the ruins? I thought that I was the only reason you came to Tagus. I never fooled you for a second. Still, you are the most important reason. Am l? That's the problem with being such a well-known liar. Even when I'm telling the truth, no one believes me. These have to be confiscated. Is that necessary? If the Taguans caught you there... Come on! You gave me the same warning about Sarthong V. I remember. It didn't stop me. I brought back some impressive artefacts! And sold them for an impressive profit? That's what I do! Not on board my ship. I will not allow it! Get one thing straight. I cannot change who I am for you or anyone. Nor can I change who I am. Then we have nothing more to say. So it would seem. Sleeping alone? I'm in no mood for your foolishness, Q. There's something different about you. You seem tense, preoccupied, somewhat smaller. I thought it was your horrible lecture, but I was wrong. Whatever your game is it will have to wait till tomorrow. I had such high hopes for you, Picard. I thought you were more evolved than the rest of your species. But now I realize you're as weak as all the others. Still, it pains me to see the great Picard brought down by a woman. What woman? Don't play coy with me, Captain. I witnessed your little spat with Vash. Nor will I forget the anguish on your face. The pain, the misery. If I didn't know better, I'd have thought you were already married. Your imagination is running away with you! This human emotion, love. It's a dangerous thing and you're ill-equipped to handle it. She's found a vulnerability in you, something I've looked for for years. If I'd known sooner, I would have appeared as a female. Mark my words, Picard. This is your Achilles heel. Believe what you wish. Do you deny that you care for this woman? I'd be doing you a favour if I turned her into a Klabnian eel. Stay away from her, Q! I was just trying to help. My debt to you... Is hereby nullified! I don't want your help, your advice, your favours, or, for that matter, you. Understand? Once and for all! You'd have me stand idly by as she led you to your destruction? Yes! As you wish. Ladies and gentlemen, members of the Archaeology Council, welcome. Mystery. It is the mystery of Tagus III that brings us here together today. It is a mystery that has invited more argument, more deduction, more speculation than the best works of fiction. And, if you will excuse the conceit, I want to tell you about my detective story. For several years, I've tried to unravel the secrets of Tagus III. I've not succeeded. However, I have found some new information that, if nothing else, only raises a new set of mysteries which I hope we can discuss together. There have been 947 known archaeological excavations on the planet's surface. Of those, 74 have revealed findings of major importance. The earliest was some 22,000 years ago. What the hell...? Q! Is this Tagus III? I doubt there are many oak trees on Tagus. No. I think this is supposed to be Earth, somewhere round about the 12th century. This is England, or to be precise, Q's recreation of Sherwood Forest. That explains the costumes. Right, Number One. Or should I say John Little. If he's Little John, that makes you... I know! Robin Hood. Sir, I protest! I am not a Merry Man! On the contrary, Lt Worf, your clothing identifies you as Will Scarlet. Geordi's mandolin identifies him as Alan-a-Dale. You, Mr. Data, bear a striking resemblance to Friar Tuck. I will not play the fool for Q's amusement! I have you at last, Robin Hood. Quick, into the forest! Mr. Worf, that's an order! Enough, you fools! We'll never find them in the greenwood. I've managed to stop the bleeding. Q! It's about time you showed up. I would prefer you to address me as the High Sheriff of Nottingham. We will not share in this pointless fantasy! Fine! Stay here and do nothing. By midday tomorrow, your crew will be safely aboard their ship. But you'll have to accept the consequences of your inaction. Consequences? What is the one thing that Robin Hood is most famous for? He robs the rich to give to the poor. Besides that. Perhaps you refer to the rescue of Maid Marian from Nottingham Castle? Yes, Data! And it just so happens Sir Guy of Gisbourne has decreed Maid Marian's head shall come off tomorrow at noon. Vash! It's your choice, Robin. Either take your ease in this sylvan glade or risk your life to save the woman you care nothing about. My feelings for Vash are irrelevant. I would try to save any innocent life, as you know. What about your Merry Men? Will you jeopardize their lives as well? Is Vash's life worth more than Data's or Troi's or Worf's? Worf, you'd make a perfect throw rug in Nottingham Castle. Q, end this before someone gets hurt! That's impossible. I've given this fantasy, as you call it, a life of its own. I have no more idea what will happen than you do. But of one thing I am absolutely sure. If you dare come to Nottingham Castle, blood will be spilt. You'll wear yourself out with all that pacing, milady! I told you to stop calling me that. The name is Vash. My poor lamb. You've got a brain sickness, for sure! Can't I get something to ease your suffering? I could use a drink. I wasn't thinking of spirits, but I've some nice fresh leeches. To drain the fever. Out! Get out! Her mind's in a turmoil, Sir Guy! Who the hell are you? Milady, everyone in Nottingham knows. Sir Guy of Gisbourne! Sir Guy of what? Leave us. Do not mock me, Lady Marian. I'm prepared to offer you one last chance to change your mind. Will you marry me? I see. Then the execution will proceed as scheduled. What execution? I warn you. This pathetic feigning of madness will not save your life. You mean I'm the one being executed? Sir Guy, wait a minute! Couldn't we talk this over? I admit, I haven't been myself lately. Maybe we've both been a bit hasty? Please? Sorry. Data! Are you alright? The arrow impacted above my sixth intercostal support, penetrating my secondary subprocessor. Fortunately, my biofunctions seem unaffected. Do not be concerned, Counsellor. I believe your aim is improving. We must get out of here, Captain. Not ""we"", Number One. You must all stay here till I return. You're going to save her yourself? It's not a mission. It's personal. It's between Q and me. I don't want you involved. Captain! You have your orders, Commander. And I expect you to follow them! A touch sharper, shall we? Such benevolence! Allowing the prisoner a breath of fresh air? You're mistaken, Sheriff. Maid Marian promises to be my wife. What?! But that's impossible! Not at all. Though I admit a maiden seldom wins such a noble husband. A toast. To the most beautiful bride-to-be in the whole of England. Don't drink that! It could be poison. Have you gone mad? A foul scheme of Robin Hood's. She's in league with him. Robin Hood? Robin Hood! Well, that was over long ago. You're still in love with him! That's a lie! He bewitched me. He put me under some evil spell. I suspected as much. Add sorcery to the list of charges against that rogue. If anyone's bewitched here, it's you. Silence! Any more impudence and it'll be your head on the block! Guard! Escort Lady Marian to her chamber. I'd rather stay here with you. Of course you would, my child! But I have important business. Lovely creature! Intriguing. One step closer, I'll scream! Vash, damn it, it's me! Jean-Luc! You won't believe what I've been going through! Suddenly, I'm in Nottingham. They were gonna chop my head off. Now I have to marry this Sir Guy, and everyone insists on calling me Marian! Yes, I know. You do? But how? You're Robin Hood! My staff and I were brought here by an old adversary, Q. I'll tell you more when we're safe. Quick! The others are outside? Back in the forest. You came alone? Right. What kind of plan is that? A good one. You know our lives are at stake? Only too well. Your best strategy is one man against a castle? You have a better one? How about you go and I stay here? And do what? Marry Sir Guy if I have to. That's brilliant! If there's a way to escape, I'll find it eventually, with my head still attached! You believe I'd leave you here? I can look after myself. You are the most stubborn woman I ever knew. There'll be no escape this time, Robin Hood! Stay behind me. You should have left. Well done, my dear. Consider it my wedding gift, darling. Congratulations, Sir Guy. You've snared the jackal. It's Marian who deserves the credit. Took him with his own sword. You sent for me, milady? Take this to Robin's men. Me, go to Sherwood Forest at this time of night?! Leave immediately. But it's dark. I'll get lost. And it's not safe, with all them hedge robbers lurking about. Please. This is urgent. You'd be better off with Sir Guy. He has a future. You'll be living in London afore long! You must go, or they'll kill him! Out! How dare you barge in! I wish to apologize for my harsh words. I'd no idea you were so ruthless. Most gracious of you! I admit I was surprised, but no more than Jean-Luc. You're Q! Yes. And you are a very interesting woman. What is this? Give that to me! A letter to Riker! ""Quick! Come to the castle. Save the Captain."" This is wonderful! What marvellous duplicity. You certainly fooled Sir Guy. Me, as well! I think you're worth further study. Am l? Unfortunately, we just don't have the time. Guards! Take this traitor away! It appears there'll be a double execution. This whole thing is your fault. My fault?! Yes, your fault. If you hadn't grabbed my sword, we'd be in Sherwood now. I grabbed your sword to stop you being killed. Really? Not as a wedding present for Sir Guy? You know I wouldn't go through with that. Do l? You shouldn't interfere. You're the one interfering! I was rescuing you! Next time, don't bother. I won't. Don't you two ever stop arguing? Tell me, Robin, as you face the termination of your insect existence, do you see what brought you to this end? Was she worth it? Can we just get this over with? Are you implying that I'm not worth it? Q, your game was for my benefit. She is innocent in all of this. She is many things, none of them innocent. Let her go! Jean-Luc, you do care! A gallant gesture, Robin, but a futile one. Farewell. I hope the two of you are happy together. You have been found guilty of outlawry and high treason. Anything to say before sentence is carried out? I... Prepare them for the block! There are too many of them. Data, we need a diversion now. Guards! Take Marian to the tower! I'll have you know I'm the greatest swordsman in all of Nottingham. Very impressive! There's something you should know! And what would that be? I'm not from Nottingham. Jean-Luc! It's over, Q! Get us out of here! My compliments, Picard. Robin Hood himself couldn't have done better. If you've hurt any of my people... Sadly enough, they're all fine. My point is, they might have been killed. So might you. All for the love of a maid. My debt to you, Picard, is paid, If you've learned how weak you are, if you see how love brings out the worst in you... You're absolutely wrong! It's brought out the best in him. His nobility, courage, self-sacrifice, tenderness... You're good. You're really good! Enough of this! Indeed. Is everyone here? Where's Vash? Computer, locate Council Member Vash. Council Member Vash is not aboard the Enterprise. Hello, Jean-Luc. This is a relief. I thought Q had found you... He had things to discuss with me. Indeed? Surprised he's not gloating over his victory. He was right about one thing. As ridiculous as it was, his game did prove that you still care. I may not show my feelings to my crew, but I do have them. I'll miss you, Jean-Luc. So, where are you off to now? I haven't made up my mind. She has the entire universe to choose from. Meet my new partner. Him? Why not? I'll tell you why not! Jean-Luc, let's not be unkind. He's devious, amoral, unreliable, irresponsible and... ..and definitely not to be trusted! Remind you of someone you know? As a matter of fact, it does. We're going to have fun. I'll take her places no human has ever seen. Who can resist an offer like that? As payment in full of your debt to me, you will guarantee her safety. She will not be harmed, I promise you that. Are you going to kiss her goodbye? Alright. Well? Aren't you? I'm sorry. I forgot my hat. Goodbye, Jean-Luc. "
S4E21,"Captain's log, star date 44769.2. We have had a Klingon exobiologist on board as part of a scientific exchange programme. Unfortunately, we suspect he was involved in a security breach and in the possible sabotage of our warp drive. Why did you access the propulsion- system files on star date 44758? I didn't. Yes, you did, from computer 12B-9, deck 36. The computer logged in your ID from your communicator. It must be a mistake. J'Dan, we have reports that schematic drawings of our dilithium chamber fell into Romulan hands one week later. I know nothing about it. Or the explosion that disabled the warp drive at the same time? No. I was not involved! You accuse me because I am Klingon. Our chief of security is Klingon. That has nothing to do with it. Send me home then if you are so distrusting. We've contacted the Klingon High Council. You'll be returned home after our investigation. I have nothing more to say. Very well. Worf, accompany the Lieutenant to his quarters. What do you think? It's hard to tell. He's very closed, but he is hiding something. On the Klingon homeworld your name is not mentioned. It is as though you never existed. A terrible burden for a warrior to bear, to become nothing, to be without honour, without the chance for glory. I have friends, powerful friends, on the homeworld. I could talk to them. They might help to restore your name... ..if you could just take me to a shuttlecraft. It could be done without anyone knowing about it. I don't know how you sent information to the Romulans, but I will find out. Pahtk! When we inform the Klingon High Council, they will put you to a slow death. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission... to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, supplemental. Retired admiral, Norah Satie, who exposed the alien conspiracy against Starfleet three years ago, is arriving to assist in our inquiry. Captain Picard. Admiral Satie, welcome aboard. Delighted to be here. I managed to acquire my former staff. My aide, Sabin Genestra from Betazed and my assistant, Nellen Tore from Delb II. This is my first officer, Cmdr William Riker. May I show you to your quarters? Starfleet Command was so concerned with your report they brought me out of retirement. I think I should get right to work. Very well. Cmdr Riker, please see to the Admiral's staff. I'd like to inspect the damage to your engine room. Admiral Satie, this is Cmdr Data, Cmdr La Forge. Admiral. We can't get in. The radiation level is still too high to raise the door. How much longer? At the rate the level is decreasing, we will gain entry in 49 hours. Would you like to see the visual log of the explosion? Yes. This was logged four days ago at 0300 hours. The confinement field was activated and the isolation doors came down. No one was killed, but two people have radiation burns. Have you made any assessments? Slow-motion study suggests that the articulation frame collapsed. The schematics stolen from the Enterprise, some involved the articulation frame of the dilithium chamber. That's one reason we tend to suspect sabotage. Other evidence lends credence to that theory. The sensor logs indicate all systems were within normal parameters 52 milliseconds before the explosion. We haven't found anything suggesting a malfunction. Captain, I think I'll need a full briefing before we go any further. By all means, Admiral. Cmdr Data, La Forge, I don't envy you your job. Good luck. There are disturbing overtones in a Klingon providing information to the Romulans. Are you aware of other Klingon-Romulan connections Starfleet might have encountered recently? I don't believe... ..what Starfleet Command knows or doesn't know is for me to reveal. This ship has encountered several incidents, which suggest a potential alliance between the two. We're aware of that. What we must concentrate on is the business at hand. Come. Excuse me, I did not know... Please come in. I want my guest to meet you. This is my head of security, Lt Worf. Captain, I've been pursuing the investigation of Lt J'Dan. I know how he transferred information off the Enterprise. Well done, Lieutenant! This is J'Dan's. A hyposyringe he uses to treat his Ba'ltmasor Syndrome, but it's been fitted with an optical reader modified to read data from Starfleet isolinear chips. He can extract digital computer data, encode it in amino-acid sequences and transfer them into a fluid in the syringe. Then he injects someone, perhaps without their knowledge. Or perhaps with their knowledge. The information would be carried in their bloodstream in inert proteins. The body itself becomes a conveyor of top secret files. Lieutenant Worf, when we confront J'Dan, I want you to conduct the interrogation. I would be honoured. Captain. Admiral. Captain, I predict that officer will be extremely valuable in this investigation. I've tracked the movements of everyone who's left the Enterprise since you came. I traced one Tarkanian diplomat as far as the Cruses System, where he disappeared and has not been seen since. That proves nothing. A hyposyringe was discovered in your quarters. I take injections. Everyone knows that. Your injections do not include an optical chip-reader. This device has but one function, to transform computer information into biological sequences. The blood of Klingons has become water! Since the Federation alliance, we have become mewling babies. Romulans are strong, worthy allies. They don't turn Klingons into weaklings like you! Lieutenant. How did you damage the dilithium chamber? I had nothing to do with that. You mean it was coincidence it was sabotaged after you gave the design plans to the Romulans? I had nothing to do with it. You've admitted your crime. Why lie now? I am not lying. Mr. Worf, you may have him confined. Sabin? I believe he's telling the truth. He admits stealing files but not sabotaging the chamber. I get no sense he's lying. But if you're right someone else may be involved. I think, Captain, you have a bigger problem on your ship than just one Klingon exchange officer. I've seen this before. The spectre of conspiracy on a starship is a frightening one. I can scarcely believe it myself. But I am so grateful for your presence, Admiral. If anyone in Starfleet can help us, it's you. Captain, I find myself changing my mind about you. In what way? When Starfleet ordered me here, it was with the express command that we work on this as equals. My father taught me to avoid partnerships. Most are lopsided. That sounds like Judge Aaron Satie. You knew my father? Only from his writings. He was required reading at the Academy. He was an extraordinary man. Every night at the dinner table, he would pose a question for debate. My brothers and I would wrangle it from one side and the other. Father would referee, with a stopwatch, so we'd learn brevity. He wouldn't let us leave until we had completely explored the issue. I'll wager you trounced your brothers in debates. More than once. Father loved it when I nailed them with some subtle point of logic. All that I am, I owe to him. He was a giant. You must miss him very much. Captain, I always preferred working alone. That way if something went wrong, I didn't have to go far for the cause. I resented you being assigned to me. But I was wrong. We're going to be quite a team. J'Dan did not make friends easily. There are not many to question. You've done a thorough job. I am strongly motivated in this matter. Yes, I can see that. I don't mind telling you I'm surprised. Frankly, when I first heard about your father... My father? Yes. There are some who believe he betrayed your people to the Romulans. What he did or did not do is no one's concern but my own. Of course. I only meant before I saw you in action I considered you a possible security risk. But you have the Admiral's and my complete confidence. You have nothing to prove to us. If there is a conspiracy on board, I promise you I will find it. Good. You know the ship and the personnel. You know exactly what we're up against. We're counting on you. I will arrange for the interviews to begin. How often did Lieutenant J'Dan come in for his injections? About once a week. Did you administer them yourself? No. Then who did? I had one of my assistants do that. Did he ever say anything that seemed innocent that might now shed light on this investigation? No, nothing. In fact, he rarely spoke at all. Thank you, Dr Crusher. We appreciate your time. Mr. Worf, bring in the next person. Please sit down, Mr. Tarses. For the record, tell us your name and position. Simon Tarses, Crewman First Class, medical technician. I assure you, Mr. Tarses, this is an informal inquiry. We are not accusing you of anything. However, if you would like counsel, it can be provided. No, sir, I have nothing to hide. How long have you held your appointment? Since star date 43587. Mr. Tarses, your records state that you were born on Mars Colony. That's right. Then you are human? Largely. My pa... paternal grandfather was Vulcan. I see that. What is your relationship with the Klingon, J'Dan? He... There's no relationship. He just came in for his injections. Did you give him those injections? Sometimes. There were several of us. I might have done it twice. Did he make comments that are, in retrospect, suspicious? Not really. He hardly ever talked. Did you ever see him outside sickbay? Once or twice in ten-forward, with a group. But I never had a conversation with him. Thank you, Mr. Tarses. I think that's all. Captain? You are excused. Mr. Worf? Wait. He's lying. He's frightened. He's covering something. It's clear he's frightened. That's hardly... It's more than that. He wasn't truthful. He's covering a lie, one so big, it's overwhelming him. I think we've found the man. Admiral. I have to tell you, you must not expect me to permit any action against Mr. Tarses solely on the basis of Betazoid intuition. Sabin has uncanny instincts. I've learned to trust them. I'm not happy about this use of a Betazoid. You have a Betazoid counsellor. You are aware of the advantages. There is a difference between a counsellor and an investigator. Do you never use your counsellor during interrogations? Yes, I do. But I would not act solely on the basis of her instinct. Nor do l. But you're asking... You're asking me to restrict Mr. Tarses' movements solely on the basis of Sabin's feeling. If Counsellor Troi suggested that someone on this ship were dangerous, would you not act on that, observe him, curb his activity? Yes, I admit I probably would. And perhaps I should re-evaluate that behaviour. Oh, nonsense. Let's keep our priorities straight. It's important to uncover the conspiracy on this ship and prevent further damage. If Tarses is a possible saboteur, you cannot allow him access to sensitive areas. And I strongly suggest continuous surveillance. If we had clear evidence... We will have clear evidence. Sabin and Lt Worf are continuing to investigate. But if you don't act until then, it may be too late. No. I won't treat a man as a criminal unless there is cause to do so. While being so generous, you give a saboteur a chance to strike again? Last time it was just a hatch cover. What if next time it's more serious? What if lives are lost? Can you afford not to act? Engineering to Captain Picard. Yes, Mr. La Forge? Can you come to Engineering? We've got something to show you. We'll be right there. We got in here six hours ago. We've been going over it inch by inch. We made analyses of the dilithium chamber, the hatch, the blast pattern from the explosion. We did mass spectrometer readings, sifted the debris for bomb fragments. What did you find? This is the frame for the hatch. It ruptured right along here. When we take a reading of that spot... See? I'm out of my element, Commander. You'll have to interpret for me. There are submicron fractures in the metal casing. A breakdown of the atomic cohesive structure. Yes, and what caused them? Those fractures suggest nothing more than simple neutron fatigue. I speculate that when the engine was last inspected, the casing was replaced with one with an undetectable defect. I believe the conclusion must be that the explosion was not intentional. That's how I see it. This wasn't sabotage. It was nothing more than an accident. An accident? I find that hard to believe. If my crew say it was not sabotage, then there was none. Let us keep our perspective. Just because there was no sabotage doesn't mean there isn't a conspiracy. We do have a confessed spy. And he had confederates. Do we know for sure? Of course he did. Do you think J'Dan could have come on board and accomplish what he did without inside help? I agree it would be difficult. But not impossible. We should continue to investigate Tarses. He was hiding something. Captain, Lt Worf and I are working well together. I suggest we continue, if only to determine Tarses' innocence. Now, please! Let me remind you he is innocent until proven guilty. Of course he is. What Sabin is saying is that he and Lt Worf would like to establish his innocence, unequivocally, for his own sake. Very well. But let us put this to rest as quickly as possible. You opened the hearing to spectators? It isn't good to have closed-door proceedings. It invites rumour and speculation. Nevertheless, it's wise... Spies and saboteurs don't like the bright lights of an open inquiry. They're like roaches, scurrying for the dark corner. This hearing is convened on star date 44780 as a continuing inquiry into the activities of Crewman Simon Tarses. For your own protection, I've assigned a counsel to you, Cmdr William Riker. Thank you, but I don't need protection. I have done nothing wrong. Dr Crusher, have you observed Crewman Tarses with J'Dan? Well, yes. He gave him his injection. I meant outside of sickbay. I think so, perhaps in ten-forward. Whom else have you observed at these occasions? I don't understand the relevance. It was an innocent social gathering. If it was so innocent, why do you hesitate to give us the names? Thank you, Doctor. If you have a case to make against Simon Tarses, make it, otherwise I'm stopping this here and now. Mr. Tarses,... ..do you have access to the biological supplies in sickbay? It's part of my job, yes. J'Dan used deoxyribose suspensions to carry the encoded files. Isn't one of your duties to prepare the suspensions? The job is shared. Isn't it true your security clearance allows you access to stores and files in sickbay? Access at any time? Because I have access doesn't... What if I told you there is evidence that the explosion in the engine room was caused by a corrosive chemical, one that is kept stored in sickbay? I had nothing to do with that. How can we believe you? How can we believe someone whom we know to be a liar? I object! There is no basis for calling him a liar. Agreed. Mr. Sabin... Captain, the basis will become clear in a moment. Mr. Tarses, didn't you deliberately lie on your personnel application, and compound the lie by repeating it to this committee? What? Isn't it true that the grandfather of whom you speak was not a Vulcan but was in fact a Romulan? That is Romulan blood you carry and a Romulan heritage you honour? We're waiting, Mr. Tarses! On the advice of my counsel, I refuse to answer that question in... ..in that the answer... ..might serve to incriminate me. You and Marcus will track Tarses' movements over the last five years. Ensign Kellogg, I want a list of all relatives, known associates and especially old school friends. And arrange for a polygraph scan... Mr. Worf? Yes, Captain? I need to speak with you. You are dismissed. Please get your reports to me as soon as possible. Do you see what is happening here, Mr. Worf? Sir? This is not unlike a... a drumhead trial. I do not understand. 500 years ago, military officers would upend a drum, sit at it and dispense summary justice. Decisions were quick, punishments severe, appeals denied. Those who came to a drumhead were doomed. But we know there is a traitor here. J'Dan has admitted his guilt. True. He will stand for his crime. Tarses has all but done the same. How? He didn't answer a question about his grandfather. That is not a crime, Worf! Nor can we infer his guilt because he didn't respond. Sir, if a man were not afraid of the truth, he would answer. Oh, no. We cannot allow ourselves to think that. The Seventh Guarantee is one of the most important rights granted by the Federation. We cannot take a principle of the Constitution and turn it against a citizen. Sir, the Federation does have enemies. We must seek them out. Oh, yes. That's how it starts. But the road from legitimate suspicion to rampant paranoia is much shorter than we think. Something is wrong here, Mr. Worf. I don't like what we have become. There you are, Mr. Tarses. Would you care for some lemon? No, thank you, sir. This is fine. Tell me about yourself, Crewman. I know you were born on Mars Colony. Yes, sir. All my life I wanted to be in Starfleet. I went to the Academy's programme for enlisted personnel. I trained as a medical technician and served at several outposts. The day I was posted here was the happiest of my life. Did you consider applying to the Academy to become an officer? My parents wanted me to. Then I thought about it. I used to sit under this big tree near the parade grounds... An elm with a circular bench? That's the one. I spent many an hour there. It was my favourite spot to study I used to sit under that tree and watch the drills. Picture myself an officer. I know it would have made my mother very happy but... You didn't do it. No. I was 18... and eager. The last thing I wanted was to spend four years sitting in classrooms. I wanted to be out there, travelling the stars. I didn't want to wait for anything. And now it's done, isn't it? My career in Starfleet is finished. Not if you aren't guilty, Simon. It doesn't matter. I lied on my application. That mistake will be with me for the rest of my life. Mr. Worf has found a brother who still lives on Mars Colony. Have him interviewed. Admiral Satie? Start a check into all his friends at the Academy. Admiral Satie? Yes, Captain? I would like a word with you. Of course. In private.... and off the record. Of course. After all, you are my partner in this. I cannot believe you mean this! But I do. This must stop. It has gone too far. You lied about the engine room. There were no volatile chemicals. It was a tactic. A way of applying pressure. We are hounding an innocent man. And how have you determined that? I've talked with him. I see. He told you he was a victim of circumstance, blameless and pure? No. He admits his mistake in falsifying his application. It does not make him a traitor. How can you be so incredibly naive? Captain, may I tell you how I've spent the past four years? From planet to star base to planet. I have no home. I live on starships and shuttlecraft. I haven't seen a family member in years. I have no friends. But I have a purpose. My father taught me, from the time I was a little girl, that the United Federation of Planets is the most remarkable institution ever conceived. And it is my cause to make sure that this extraordinary union be preserved. I cannot imagine why you are trying to block this investigation. Others in the past have doubted me. They came to regret it. The hearings on Simon Tarses will stop. If necessary, I will go to Starfleet Command. I have news for you, Captain. I've been in constant contact with Starfleet Command. The hearings are not going to stop. They're going to be expanded. What are you saying? I'm going to get to the heart of this conspiracy if it means investigating every last person on this ship. Every hearing from now on will be held in the presence of Admiral Thomas Henry of Starfleet Security. I've requested he be brought here. You never told me about this. I report to Starfleet Command directly. I do not need your permission or your approval for my decisions. Admiral. What you're doing here is unethical. It's immoral. I'll fight it. Do what you must, Captain. And so will l. Captain, warp engines are back on line. We are ready to commence restart sequences. Sir? Yes? Yes, yes, of course. Proceed, Mr. Data. You alright, Captain? Yes, of course, Number One. Just a little preoccupied. Admiral Satie orders you to report to the interrogation room at 0900 hours. You are to be questioned before the committee. Captain's log, supplemental. Admiral Henry, who has worked closely with Norah Satie in the past, has arrived to observe the hearings. Your full name? Jean-Luc Picard. Your rank? Captain, Starship Enterprise. How long have you held this post? Three years, since star date 41124. Very well. Admiral? There is something I'd like to say. If you have a statement, you'll have an opportunity to make it later. I believe Article 12 of the Uniform Code of Justice grants me the right to make a statement before questioning begins. Very well. I'm deeply concerned about what is happening here. It began when we apprehended a spy, a man who admitted his guilt and who will answer for his crime. But the hunt didn't end there. Another man, Mr. Simon Tarses, was brought to trial. And it was a trial, no matter what others choose to call it. A trial based on insinuation and innuendo. Nothing substantive offered against Mr. Tarses, much less proven. Mr. Tarses' grandfather is Romulan. And for that reason his career now stands in ruins. Have we become so... fearful, have we become so cowardly,... ..that we must extinguish a man because he carries the blood of a current enemy? Admiral,... ..let us not condemn Simon Tarses, or anyone else, because of their bloodlines, or investigate others for their innocent associations. I implore you, do not continue with this... ..proceeding. End it now. Captain, do you believe in the Prime Directive? Of course. In fact it is Starfleet's General Order Number One, is it not? Your point, Admiral? Would it surprise you to learn you have violated it nine times since you took command of this ship? It certainly surprised the hell out of me. My reports to Starfleet document the circumstances of those instances. We're looking into those reports, very closely into those reports, after which we will have more questions for you about your so-called commitment to Starfleet Prime Directive. Captain, could you tell us just what happened on star date 44390? Pardon? Let me refresh your memory. You were transporting a Vulcan ambassador, T'Pel. I was following orders to take this ambassador to a location near the Neutral Zone. We don't need the preamble. In fact, she was not a Vulcan at all, was she? She was a Romulan spy! That's correct. A spy you delivered back into the hands of the enemy! Tell me, Captain, when the deception was revealed and she stood proudly on the bridge of a Romulan ship, did you make any effort to retrieve her? No. No. Even though you knew she carried Federation secrets she'd been accumulating for years. The Enterprise could have been captured by the Romulans! Capt Picard did the only thing he could. Really? Where were you when the traitor was on board? Where was ship's Security? Isn't it questionable to have a security officer whose father was a Romulan collaborator? Lieutenant. Tell me, Captain, have you completely recovered from your experience with the Borg? Yes, I have completely recovered. It must have been awful for you, actually becoming one of them, being forced to use your vast knowledge of Starfleet operations to aid the Borg. Just how many of our ships were lost? 39? And a loss of life, I believe, measured at nearly 11,000. One wonders how you can sleep at night, having caused so much destruction. I question your actions, Captain. I question your choices. I question your loyalty. You know, there are some words I've known since I was a schoolboy. ""With the first link, the chain is forged. The first speech censured, the first thought forbidden, the first freedom denied, chains us all irrevocably."" Those words were uttered by Judge Aaron Satie as wisdom and warning. The first time any man's freedom is trodden on, we're all damaged. I fear that day... How dare you! You who consort with Romulans invoke my father's name to support your traitorous arguments! It is an offence to everything I hold dear. And to hear those words used to subvert the Federation! My father was a great man. His name stands for integrity and principle. You dirty his name when you speak it. He loved the Federation. But you, Captain, corrupt it. You undermine our very way of life. I will expose you for what you are! I have brought down bigger men than you, Picard! I have nothing more to say. Perhaps we should call a recess until tomorrow. Am I bothering you, Captain? No. Please, Mr. Worf, come in. It is over. Admiral Henry has called an end to any more hearings on this matter. That's good. Admiral Satie has left the Enterprise. We think we've come so far. Torture of heretics, burning of witches, it's all ancient history. Then, before you can blink an eye, suddenly it threatens to start all over again. I believed her. I helped her. I did not see what she was. Mr. Worf, villains who twirl their moustaches are easy to spot. Those who clothe themselves in good deeds are well camouflaged. I think, after yesterday, people will not be so ready to trust her. Maybe. But she, or someone like her, will always be with us, waiting for the right climate in which to flourish, spreading fear in the name of righteousness. Vigilance, Mr. Worf, that is the price we have to continually pay. "
S4E22,"Counsellor Deanna Troi, personal log, star date 44805.3. My mother is on board. Jean-Luc! You delicious man! You were just thinking of me. As a matter of fact... Think no further. She's here! Yes, indeed. Oh, serious! You're always so serious. Lwaxana, as a matter of fact, I am rather busy at the moment. You're always busy with something. Never the right thing. My daughter says that we're picking up someone interesting. Yes, the leading scientist from Kaelon II. Kaelon II! I've never heard of that. Well, it is something of a rather delicate... situation. It's the first real contact with a rather reclusive race. And... This is in the nature of an official greeting... Diplomacy. I adore diplomacy. Everyone dresses so well. Mr. O'Brien, energize. Dr Timicin, I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. This is Lt-Cmdr La Forge. I beg your pardon. It's my first time aboard a Federation starship. Yes. They told me. Shaking hands, a form of greeting. I beg your pardon. Dr Timicin, allow me to present Lwaxana Troi of Betazed. She is a guest... Daughter of the Fifth House. Holder of the Sacred Chalice of Rixx. What are you doing for dinner? I don't know. Lwaxana, we have quite a bit of work planned. The man's never been on board a starship before. Somebody ought to make him comfortable before you start. It seems that Mrs. Troi is our acting ambassador of goodwill. Think of me as your entertainment director. That man's in trouble. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, star date 44805.7. For generations, Kaelon II has worked to revitalize its dying sun. The Federation has offered to assist in what may be a solution. The theory of helium fusion enhancement has been discussed for over a century. There has been no practical application until now. The modifications to the torpedo's guidance systems are remarkable. Well, we'll see. They still have to be proved. But now it's possible. I'd never dared to hope for such a perfect match. My only regret is it took us three years to find a suitable sun after you had first contacted us. We're not used to dealing with other worlds. We're not used to asking for anything. Your offer of help has given us a possible means of survival. It's taken 40 years to develop programming that will control your photon torpedoes. It has been my life. Thank you for this opportunity. My only wish has been to find a way to revive our sun... ..before I die. Mrs. Troi, I must protest your unauthorized presence on the bridge. What does that one do, Mr. Woof? Please! That is a torpedo launch initiator and it's... It is Worf, madam, not Woof. There you are, my dear! Where have you been? I've been waiting. So nice to see you again so soon. Mrs. Troi. Mother, what did you want? What? You were waiting for me. Yes, of course I was. You must let me relieve the tedium of all this work, work, work. I am expected in Engineering. I'm sorry. Mrs. Troi, I have to ask you to clear the bridge, please. Why? There are lots of people here. Mother. Please. Well, don't you worry. We'll have our little chat later. I'd never have thought her old enough to be your mother. She is... ..vibrant. If you look at the next simulation, you'll see we need the temperature to stabilize at 220 million, or... Enough is enough. Rescue is at hand. Dr Timicin. Would you clear all this mess off the table, please? This mess, Mrs. Troi... Now, now. You boys have been shut up in here for hours. If you don't eat, you'll get sick. Who's that going to help? I've made some perfectly marvellous Mantickian páté. Mr. Homn will lay it out for us. Mr. Homn is my valet. He doesn't say much. How can he? It is true that the efficiency of high-order beings does diminish proportionately with deprivation of nutritious fuel. Alright! Don't you start. Mrs. Troi, you're a wise woman. I'm sure we could use a respite. These two call me Mrs. Troi. You call me Lwaxana. Mr. Homn, spread it. Knowing my daughter would be passing Betazed again, I manoeuvred a ride and here I am. Deck eight. I have a grown daughter. She has a small son of her own. Then you're married. My wife died quite some years ago. One thing I don't understand. If your people have known for generations their sun is dying, why not simply evacuate the planet? It is our home. It defines who we are. If Kaelon II ceases to exist, so do we. Then you definitely should fix it. With the Federation's help, I hope we will. The Federation will be pleased to offer whatever help it can. Would you come in? That's extremely kind of you, but... My valet sleeps elsewhere. You're delightful. You make me laugh. I don't mean your invitation makes me laugh. I took that seriously. I mean... Just say yes. I'll make you laugh some more. I wish I could. But I must say no. Good night. Captain's log, star date 44807.5. The Enterprise has arrived at the Praxillus system, where we will conduct Dr Timicin's helium ignition test. Mother...? Little one, why do you refuse to use telepathy even when we're alone? We're not alone, Mother. How long will this take? You've been selecting for 20 minutes. I am a woman dressing for a man. Something you might try, dear. I wonder if Timicin likes green. That's not very telepathic of you. I tried telepathy on him. The wrong species. Right species for everything else, though. You might try that, too. You know, you're not just incorrigible, you're insatiable. I have completed long-range scans. There are no other life forms present in this system. Spacecraft? None within sensor range. Picard to Engineering. Mr. La Forge, the system is clear. Final pre-launch diagnostic, level five. All systems verified. We're ready when you are, Captain. Very well. Mr. Worf. Photon torpedoes armed... ..and targeted. Fire in sequence. First volley released. Tracking torpedoes. Entry program confirmed. Second volley released. Torpedoes entering the stellar core. Shields holding. Guidance systems normal. Ignition sequence, six seconds. Five seconds. Four. Three seconds. Now. Shock-wave patterns within predicted range. 1,700 percent rise in gamma-radiation levels. Helium fusion rate, increasing. What about heat and pressure levels? Steady. Density at 1,100 grams per cubic centimetre. Temperature approaching 60 million degrees Kelvin. We want it stable at 220 million. Pressure-wave harmonics dispersing. Temperature increasing to 81 million degrees, sir. Still rising. Temperature at 90 million degrees Kelvin. And now 110 million. Looking good. 137. Radiation and pressure levels still stable. Temperature is 170 million degrees Kelvin. 190. And now 200 million. It's happening. 207 and rising. 219. And 20. 220. And holding. Looks like congratulations may be in order. Mr. Data? Turbulence patterns within predicted parameters. 222. Temperature is rising in the core again, Captain. 230 million degrees Kelvin. Still rising. 251. Rate exceeding critical level. Core density is unstable. Let's get the hell out! Warp two now! Sorry. Capt Picard. Doctor? Permit me to express my appreciation to you and your crew. I am most grateful. I'm most grateful. Ensign, lay a course for Kaelon II. Warp factor five. Aye, sir. I'm so sorry, Timicin. Had one of those named after me. Brilliant young astronomer from Rigel IV. Of course, I sparkled a bit myself in those days. It's called fishing for a compliment. You tell me I still sparkle. I'm sorry. I'm not helping, am l? You're very kind. I'm just not adequate company. That's alright. I can make enough conversation for both of us. I'll leave you alone. No. Please stay. I wanted to tell you how much I wish we had met years ago. What difference do a few years make? Unfortunately, a great deal. You see, Lwaxana, I'm on my way home now... ..to die. Captain's log, star date 44812.6. We have returned to Kaelon II and made contact with Science Minister B'tardat. The experiment achieved a stable temperature for a short time. That's a step forward. We've been studying the sensor logs for any malfunction. If there was, and we isolate the problem, a new test might work. In the meantime, our facilities would be available to Dr Timicin. A thoughtful and generous offer. But Timicin has obligations at home. It would take some time to select a replacement. We would be willing to extend our visit, sir. That will not be necessary. We'll contact you when we're ready. We expect Timicin to return home as soon as possible. Again, gentlemen, many thanks. Come. Are you aware these people you are helping are murderers? I beg your pardon? The next thing to it. When a person on this planet reaches the age of 60, which Timicin is about to do, they are expected to kill themselves. Mr. Data? The people of Kaelon II are isolationists, almost xenophobes. We know very little about their customs. Well, I know. Timicin himself just told me. He is supposed to go down there, be wined, dined, honoured, and then kill himself. It's a barbaric ritual. The Resolution, it's called. Obviously, you can't let him go, Jean-Luc. I have no choice. I don't think you've been listening to me. The man is supposed to kill himself. You don't just let that happen. You don't turn your back. What's the matter? Sorry, but whatever my personal feelings, I have no jurisdiction here. I simply cannot interfere. But you have to. In a situation like this, you absolutely have to interfere. You've got to go down there, talk to those people. Open their eyes! Educate them! The Prime Directive forbids us to interfere with the social order of any planet. That's your prime directive, not mine. Computer, locate Counsellor Troi. What do you mean, I can't go down there? Am I a prisoner? Mother, what's going on? What are you doing? I'm sorry, I'm not sure what to do. I am sure! I am an ambassador. A Daughter of the Fifth House. Those people will answer to me! So you energize this damn thing and get me down there! He can't, Mother. He has his orders. His orders don't apply to me! No, they apply to him. Don't try your professional patronizing on me, young lady. They expect Timicin to die! Don't you realize that? Just because he's 60! What's 60? It's nothing. I'll go check the pattern buffers. Come on, Mother. Let's sit down. I'm sorry, little one. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm sorry. There's no need to be. But I'm crying. I don't cry. You cried when Father died. You remember that? Of course I remember. We both cried. But this isn't the same. Is it? What do you think? I don't know. I just... can't accept that... ..that fate will allow me to meet him like this... ..and then take him away. I mean, he's not ill. He hasn't had a tragic accident. He's just going to die. And for no good reason. Because his society has decided that he's too old. So they just dispose of him. As though his life no longer had any value or meaning. You can't possibly understand at your age, but... ..at mine... ..sometimes you feel tired... ..and afraid. You're feeling very vulnerable. Very mortal, if I may say so. But I know you, Mother. And believe me,... ..you will never be one of those who dies before they die. Come in. I have been studying the preliminary reports of the test. I don't understand where I went wrong. I thought I had taken into account all of the variables. Deep-convection patterns. Proton reactions. Neutrino count. I will say it again. You are a kind woman. No, I'm a hateful woman. I hate what you're going to do. I hate you for doing it. It is the way of my world. I wish you could accept that. I never will. Never. How long have you been there? I don't know. A minute. An hour. Do you want anything? Some tea? I want to explain. I want... ..very much... ..for you to understand. 15 to 20 centuries ago, we had no Resolution. We had no such concern for our elders. As people aged, their health failed. They became invalids. Those whose families could not care for them were put away into... ..deathwatch facilities, where they waited for the end, sometimes for years. They had meant something. They were forced to live beyond that, into a time of meaning nothing... ..of knowing they could now only be the beneficiaries of younger people's patience. We are no longer that cruel, Lwaxana. No, you're not cruel to them. You just kill them. The Resolution is a celebration of life. We end our lives with dignity. A celebration of life! It sounds very noble, very caring. You're saying you got rid of the problem by getting rid of the people. It may sound that way but it is a time of transition. One generation passing on the responsibilities of life to the next. What about the responsibility of caring for the elderly? That would place a burden on the children. We raise them, we care for them, we suffer for them. We keep them from harm their whole lives. Eventually, it's their turn to take care of us. No parent should expect to be paid for the love they gave. Why the hell not? Oskoids. What's that? Oskoid, a Betazed delicacy. Looks very interesting. You should have tried it while you were still alive. Why 60? Why not 62? A reasonable age had to be set. It's not reasonable! Certainly not in your case. You're a vital and healthy man. That is why I wish to say goodbye while I am this way, in command of my faculties, knowing they will always remember me as a vigorous man. But it makes no sense! Some of your people could be active at 70. Others might be seriously ill at 50. How cruel to make them wait so long. Setting a standard age for the Resolution makes it uniform. To ask families to decide when their elders are to die, that would be heartless. I agree. Why not let everybody die when they die? You have a grandson, you said. Yes. Almost seven. Wouldn't it be better for him to know his grandfather? Not some memory of someone who once loved him. But a real living person who does love him. Don't you think that is better? I attended the Resolution of my parents when it was their time. It was beautiful. Lwaxana, this is a custom that I have known and accepted... ..all my life. The women of Betazed used to wear wigs with holes in the centre for tiny caged creatures. Yes. First, it was a fashion. Then it went on long enough to become a custom, a tradition. But it was uncomfortable for the woman and cruel to the animal. One day, one very formidable woman finally said so, refused to ever wear another of those wigs. Fairly soon, the custom stopped. She had the courage to stand up and fight for change. She must have been like you. Timicin, there is no one more likely to save their planet than you. They would have you kill yourself. Younger scientists will take my place. My work... The work will continue. Your planet has 30, 40 years left. What if your scientists can't find the answer without you? What then? What chance does your grandson have of reaching 60? Enough, please! It is my time, Lwaxana. And that is the way it is. If that's the way it is, why bother to save your planet? If its time has come, let it die. Where is the difference, Timicin? Where? Convection-boundary uncoupling. The reaction caused gas turbulence of a totally unexpected magnitude. Why? There was evidence of a surface shock. No, I'd anticipated that. I thought I'd anticipated all possible variables. But stars, they are like living entities, in a way. Quite unpredictable. You know... I wouldn't be surprised if this were a result of... Look here. 42 seconds into the test, there is a sudden rise in the level of hydrogen alpha-emissions. And here is another. I'm right, aren't l? There had to be neutron migration within the star's inner core as the reaction grew. Perhaps, but there is no known method for controlling neutron migration. But, theoretically, it is possible. Using these test results, we could construct a new computer model of the energy dynamic of a star that can test a new program. I'm certain it can be accomplished. Certain. It's a matter of time. A matter of time. Come. Time for you to leave us? Captain. I have come to officially request... ..asylum aboard the Enterprise. Timicin, I cannot believe this. Why asylum? Asylum from what? I turn 60 in four days. Yes, and your family and colleagues are gathering for your Resolution. I believe that it is time for us to re-examine, as a people,... ..the wisdom of the Resolution. Are they forcing you into this? Are you being coerced? Influenced, perhaps. Coerced, no. Our only influence, Minister, is by example. Timicin's decision is his own free will, I assure you. I cannot believe that a man of Timicin's stature would freely reject his own culture. No one on Kaelon II understands this project as I do. Some theories would take others a decade to confirm. With my guidance, it can be done in half that time. Others started your work, others will finish it. It has always been this way. Captain, scanners indicate two Kaelon warships on an intercept course. Acknowledged, Commander. Minister, we're here in friendship, hoping to be of assistance. You have helped quite enough. I suggest you return Timicin and depart. If you attempt to leave orbit with Timicin, our ships will open fire. There's no purpose in letting this... It shouldn't have happened. I've handled this poorly. You acted in good conscience. What else could you have done? I could have let well enough alone. I could have returned home. What do you think, Captain? Have I done the right thing? I'm afraid you're the only one who can answer that. Lwaxana would... ..would have me lead a revolt. I'm only a scientist. I wish I had her strength. She is a woman of extraordinary conviction, isn't she? Isn't she? Any communications? No, sir. We have an open channel. The warships are in an attack posture. Staggered approach vectors, in weapons range. Shields up. Red alert. Doctor, return to your quarters. I don't want any bloodshed. They will do everything to avoid it. You should get out of their way. Yes, of course. I understand. Mr. Worf, ascertain their offensive potential. Aye, sir. We must transmit the new analysis immediately. If I can make them see my direction... We've tried. They refuse to accept your reports. They have to accept. If I can re-establish computer interface... They disengaged the link-up. Why don't they answer? Even if I find the solution, you will not accept it? Because I do not terminate my life, they terminate my work. Alive, I am a greater threat to my world than a dying sun. But Jean-Luc will settle this! No. My decision will lead to more distrust. Don't be foolish! I am not being foolish! I want to live because I see in you how much I have to live for. You make me realize that my life still has value. I can be an example to my people. I can finish my work. But discovering new desires and not being able to do anything about them, not being able to finish my work, or reach my people... It's a statement about the sanctity of life. It will be heard. Who will hear it from light years away? Where will I go now, Lwaxana? I'm a man without a world. I can't go home. Bridge to Dr Timicin, you have a visitor coming aboard. B'tardat? No, sir. It's your daughter. Dara. Father. This is Lwaxana Troi. She has been a host and friend. I've been looking forward to meeting you, Dara. Whatever you have to say can be said in front of her. I see. Father, come home. This is wrong. If I could show you the work I have begun. There is so much to do. There's nothing for me to look at. It is irrelevant. Your father's work may save your world. I wouldn't consider that irrelevant. All I'm concerned with now is you, not your work. Your work is over. It is your time to rest. Perhaps you will feel differently as you get older, say, 60. My father taught me to cherish the Resolution. I don't know how you have poisoned him. It's an obscene ritual. How dare you criticise my way of life and my beliefs. Please. Please, Dara. Where will you go? I don't know. And where will you die? I cannot bear the thought of you laid to rest on some other world. And you will not lie beside my mother. That I will not lie beside you when my Resolution comes. I'm sorry. I don't know how you can go on knowing that each day is an insult to everything we believe in. Father, I love you. But I am ashamed. I would like to be alone now, please. I'm suddenly not sure of myself. It's a feeling I'm not at all used to. I don't think I like it much, little one. Not sure of yourself. My life has been full. Now and then, perhaps it's overflowed a little, but... I enjoy living! Now I'm asking myself, is it possible I was wrong to encourage Timicin to choose life? You were honest with him, Mother. You had to be. Maybe I want him to live just to keep me company. Of course you do. But you didn't do this for yourself. You did it for him. Did l? Then look what I've done to him. He's like a man who's lost his faith. I never considered how deeply ingrained this Resolution liturgy is. Ritual provides structure in society, good rituals and bad rituals alike. Well, this is a bad one. Your point of view. It should be the view of any intelligent middle-aged person. Unfortunately, it is not. I'll see you later, Mother. Excuse me. Thank you. You're going back. Do you believe that I love you? I do, you know. But finally, if that is my only reason to stay alive... It's not enough. Almost. Almost, but not quite. I can't be that selfish, Lwaxana. I am not the person to lead the revolt. I do apologize for the turmoil that I've created. Doctor, I would deeply regret it if you were returning only to ease diplomatic tensions. It is more. Much more. Then I wish you and your people well. When it is time, I will encourage my people to seek your assistance. If for any reason you would like to wait. No. We have already said our goodbyes. It is the custom for loved ones to join you at this Resolution. You don't have to do this. Yes, I do. Permission to disembark, Captain. I promise I won't cause any problems there. Permission granted. We are ready, Mr. O'Brien. "
S4E23,"Dr Beverly Crusher, personal log, star date 44821.3. Began analysis today of the respiratory problems being experienced on the Beta Moon of Peliar Zel. Finally got a letter from Wesley. He's top in Exobiology, but struggling in Ancient Philosophies. And there's someone new in my life. Ambassador Odan. Dr Crusher. I was on my way to speak to you. Hello, Data. I have completed my study on the atmospheric variations on the moon. That will be helpful in my efforts to mediate the quarrel. We could go over it now. It would require just two hours. We do appreciate that, Data, but the Ambassador and I have set aside this time to... analyze the incidence of the lung disease on the moon's inhabitants. Then it is perfect timing, Doctor. When better to integrate my results into your study? Now that I think about it, you're right. Unfortunately,... I'm not feeling very well. Perhaps Dr Crusher could get you started inputting your information. I must return to my quarters. Are you still having those headaches? I'd better bring you a hypospray for it. I would be most grateful. OK. Put a cold cloth on your forehead. I'll be with you shortly. I'll set you up. You'll take a while to input the figures, won't you? At least an hour. But I do not believe much time can be saved by haste now. Data, there are times when every second does count. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Somehow, I had an unnatural fear that Data was going to barge in to discuss the peripheral effects of magnetospheric energy taps. If I don't go and look at his projections, he just might come looking for me. Do you know, when I first met the formidable Dr Beverly... What, ten days ago? ..l thought to myself, this woman is ice. Through to her bones! Who would have ever guessed that instead of ice there is fire? Odan,... Stay here. No! Are we...? Is this interfering with your work on the Peliar Zel problems? Fortunately, I've done as much as I can until we get there, because I can't seem to keep my mind on my work right now. I have... to go! No! Promise we'll be together tonight. I promise. Then you may go, Dr Beverly. It's just Beverly. It's not just Beverly. It's Beverly's smile, it's her kindness, her beauty within and without. So much more than ""just Beverly"". Picard to Ambassador Odan. Captain, this is Odan. The representative from Peliar Zel is in the observation lounge. I'll be right there, Captain. If the news were encouraging, you would not be here. I'm afraid you're correct. The situation is growing worse. Where have you been? With a patient. Minor emergency. Ambassador Odan. This is Governor Leka Trion of Peliar Zel. Ambassador, thank you for coming. I knew your father. His efforts kept our people at peace for generations. I would hope to serve you as well as he. Governor. Ambassador. I hope Dr Crusher was able to help your headache. Thank you, she was. Governor Leka has intercepted us to update us on her planet's situation. The people on our moons have been in discord since they migrated from our planet five centuries ago. To us on the planet, they're two squabbling children. We try to help them by not taking sides, but this time we are at a loss. I've studied the information you sent. I understand the people of Alpha Moon have found a way to tap into the magnetic field of your planet, and now rely exclusively on that energy source? Yes, but the Beta Moon is now suffering environmentally as a result. My design model suggests... that Beta will eventually experience rising temperatures, erratic tide surges, and, in general, the beginning of global warming. The impact on the health of the Betans is clear. There will be profound medical repercussions. Alpha is unwilling to give up its new-found energy source. Beta accuses them of intentionally courting genocide. Our efforts to reach a compromise have failed. Now we have received intelligence that both sides are arming for war. If that happens, the people on my planet will take sides, and the outcome can only be disastrous. We'll be in orbit in six hours. If you could arrange for the moon representatives to be there. Odan can beam directly down to the planet's surface. Excuse me, I prefer to shuttle to the surface. I would not recommend it, there are many radical factions involved in this dispute, it would be hard to guarantee your safety. I'm not the first to express discomfort at the idea of molecular transport. I prefer to remain intact. I'll shuttle down. As you wish. Counsellor, what is it? It's Ambassador Odan. I continually feel fluctuations of emotion from him. Perhaps it's normal among the Trill. It could be. We know so very little about them. Yes. Quite. Hi, Deanna. Hi. Is that the colgonite astringent you have on your eyes? Yes, I guess so. I've never tried it. Someone... just put it on... me. I didn't know you came in here. I don't. At least... not very often. It feels good to indulge yourself sometimes. I guess so. Especially when you haven't in a while. What is... What is that supposed to mean? Beverly,... you're in love. Sometimes, I wish you weren't so... empathic. I don't think it's really a secret. It isn't? You've been glowing. Must be the astringent. What? Nothing. Oh, yes, there is. What is it? It's just something I sense in Odan. What? What do you sense? It's just... How well do you know him? I feel I know him better than I've known anyone in my life. Am I being foolish? I don't think so. And yet, I've only known him for a couple of weeks. Of course, it could be infatuation. But as a grown-up I know the difference between love and infatuation. All I know is,... ..l haven't felt this way for a long time. And you like it. I like it. Come. You wanted to see me, Captain? Yes. Please sit down. We have entered orbit. We shall be transporting you to the planet soon. I am ready, Captain. How will you proceed when there? I can never answer that until I'm in the situation and I meet the people involved. I work very much by instinct, not by prearranged plan. It seems to work well for you. I do like to go into a situation as well-informed as possible, and I must say your staff has been quite helpful in briefing me on the problems down there. Particularly Dr Crusher. My staff is quite capable, I'm glad they've been useful. Your Dr Beverly is... ..an extraordinary person,... both as a scientist and... ..and as a woman. Yes, I'm sure that's true. Shall we make our way to the shuttle bay? Captain, you know her better than l. Do you have any idea how committed she is to remaining with Starfleet? I couldn't speak for her. Of course not. I just thought... You've known her so much longer than l. Taggart to Capt Picard. Yes, Ensign? The shuttle is ready to transport the Ambassador. Very well. I'll find my own way, Captain. I hope to return with good news. Cmdr Riker has asked to pilot you himself. I am honoured. I don't know when I'll be back. I know. Have a safe trip. I will stay safe. I have good reason to return. I've researched Earth customs. This flower is given to express love. Yes, it is. Initiate shuttle preflight sequence. Preflight under way. Shuttle has cleared the bay door. You will be out of shield range in five seconds. Acknowledged. We'll enter the upper ionosphere in two minutes. Sir, an unidentified ship is emerging from the limb of the moon. Hail the vessel. I have visual contact. I don't recognize it. It claims to be an escort vessel from the Beta Moon. There was no mention of an escort. Request a security clearance code. They do not answer, sir. Cmdr Riker, prepare to return. Acknowledged. They are loading their phaser banks. Powering the shields! Coming about. Engage tractor beam. Report, Number One. We've lost port thrusters and stabilizers. I'm losing control. We're bringing you in. The hull's weak, we're breaking up. You can't tow us. Beam us directly on board. No, don't do it. I can't stabilize the shuttle. If you transport me, it will kill me. Please! We're ready to beam you aboard. Belay that. I'll bring her in manually. Advise Dr Crusher we have a medical emergency. He's in shock, but that still doesn't explain these readings. Eosinophilia in the cerebrospinal fluid at 46 percent. Sedimentation rate is 29, but his lymphocytes are still intact. It's as though there's a parasite at work. Odan. I need to do exploratory surgery. You may have a parasitic infection. You must not. You won't survive. What is that? Beverly,... that is me. What? This body is just a host. I am that parasite. That... is what must survive. It has always been this way. The Trill are a joined species,... ..a host and a symbiont. And in this fashion, we have survived for millennia. You're dying. What can I do? The host... body is dying. You must contact the Trill quickly. Tell them I need another host. They will send a replacement. I know this is difficult to accept. But I beg you, Dr Beverly,... ..help me. This mission must be completed. Odan's host body died of the injuries just over an hour ago. But the symbiont being, Odan, is still alive. Odan is the one who negotiated the last treaty, but the man everybody thought was his father was just a host body. The reason Odan refused to transport? It would have damaged the symbiont. The Trill say another host will be here in 40 hours. I've placed Odan in stasis. He can survive another hour, maybe two, but not beyond that. Would it be possible for me to serve as a temporary carrier? No, Data. The relationship requires a biological being. We're at a desperate impasse here. The shuttle attack has inflamed the dispute. Who was responsible? No one admits to it. Each side accuses the other. We need Odan. Could a human host carry him? I believe so. From Odan's description, it should be possible, but I don't... I volunteer. There's been no precedent for a human host. I couldn't guarantee what might happen. The risk is too great. Weigh it against a possible war. It's your choice, Will. Let's get to it. I've given you a local anaesthetic. You must be conscious. Drugs might damage the symbiont. I understand. Laser scalpel. How do you feel? Is there any pain? No, just some strange sensations. Vital signs? Heart rate, 110. Blood pressure, 90/40. I can't close yet, it's not complete. Pulse, 130... and climbing. EEG is erratic. He'll fibrillate. 200 mg of metrazene. Yes, Doctor. Hang on, Will. We've got incorporation, Doctor. I'm closing. Brain waves are still irregular. The metrazene should have stabilized him. I'll give it 10 more seconds. EEG approaching regular. Blood pressure levelling off. Signs are returning to normal. Will, it's Beverly. Can you hear me? Hello. You're going to be alright. How do you feel? I'm fine. You look a little tired, Dr Beverly. I know this must be disturbing, Governor, but you must convince the moons' inhabitants that I am Odan. I have his skills, his thoughts, his memories. They will perceive you as a Starfleet officer, perhaps with your own agenda. The man they knew as my father, the man who stands before them,... ..both are merely hosts. It is your task to help them understand. I will try. I cannot promise they will listen. They are more factionalised than ever. Listening is a skill which has evaporated with the heat of argument. Speak softly, Governor. Those who cannot hear an angry shout may strain to hear a whisper. I will do what I can. Well done. Escort the Ambassador to his quarters. I'm just a little dizzy. I'll be fine. I need to lie down. Picard to Dr Crusher. Yes? The Ambassador is not well. Attend to him in his quarters. Right away, sir. White cell count is elevated,... six-tenths of a degree temperature. But no sign of rejection. That's good. You look awfully pale. Just a little weak. And light-headed. Cerebral blood flow looks normal. I'll leave a booster. Use it if the symptoms get worse. Beverly. Beyond that I don't know. This is all new to me. It is new to me as well. Don't go. We have to talk about this. I don't know what to say. Nor do l. But I know this silence would injure us. You should have thought about that sooner and told me what you were. It didn't bother you to remain silent yesterday. It never occurred to me. This is what I am. Did you ever tell me you were only a single being? Of course not. That was normal to you. I don't know who you are! You must understand, whoever... whoever I seem to be, I am Odan, who loved you. That has not changed. I still love you. I can't help that! If this causes you pain, I will suppress it, I will keep my distance. Dr Beverly,... ..l would never hurt you. May I join you? You know, Deanna, the first man I loved unconditionally was named Stefan. He was a soccer player and I would watch him race down the field and I thought my heart would stop because he was so beautiful! We married and had three children. Twin boys, Andrew and Alexander, and then later, a little girl, Jennifer. Stefan became an artist, very famous. He created huge, breathtaking metal sculptures. He came to adore me as much as I worshipped him. In my daydreams at least, Stefan was 11 and I was 8. He never even knew I existed. I loved Odan, I'm sure of it. I had no doubts, no fears. But what was it I loved? His eyes? His hands? His mouth? They're gone. If that's all it was, I should mourn him and go on. But it was more than that. I felt... completely free with him. Unguarded. At ease with myself. So many things made him special to me. Where are they? Are they still here, alive in Will Riker? I look at Will and I see someone I've known for years. A kind of... brother. But inside,... is he really Odan? Help me. Please! What do your... feelings tell you? I feel his pull. It's very powerful. I wish he'd never come on this ship. Don't wish that, Beverly. You can't be open to love if you don't risk pain. I don't care. I'd give anything not to feel this way. He's here, isn't he? Look at him. I don't want to look at him. Just keep talking to me. The first man I ever loved was my father. He was strong and tall. He carried me when the ground was muddy. He chased away the monsters that hid under my bed at night. And he sang to me. And kept me safe. And he went away. What I wouldn't give to hear those songs again. To feel his arms protect me. I never will,... ..but I can still feel his warmth and his love as though he were here with me. If you can feel those things,... ..from the man we know as Will Riker, accept them. Accept the love. Captain's log, star date 44823. 8. Representatives of the two moons of Peliar Zel have agreed to come on board to meet the new Ambassador Odan. White cell count is elevated. It's getting higher every time I read it. Are you in pain? Not much. We can stall the representatives. They'd see that as a deception. I must meet with them. To present yourself like this will not help our cause. I promise you, they will never know that I am ill. Captain, the emissaries. May I present Kalin Trose of Alpha Moon, and Lathal Bine of Beta Moon. Thank you for receiving us, Captain. Is... this Ambassador Odan? Lathal Bine. It was your aunt who represented Beta 30 years ago. That is correct. She was a formidable woman. I had the utmost respect for her. And who was it who spoke for Alpha so long ago? That was you, of course. Kalin Trose. Then you were a young man, bristling with passion and zeal, yet wise enough to understand that your people needed peace to ensure their future. And how did you achieve a compromise between that young man and the iron-willed woman of Beta? They traded places for a week, to understand each other's situation with more informed eyes. After that, agreement came swiftly. Nothing that you have said is beyond what a school child could learn in a history book. What is not commonly known is that during the negotiations, you, Kalin Trose, quelled a plot by a radical from your own moon who was attempting to assassinate the Beta delegate. It is true. Perhaps he was wiser in his youth than he is now. Odan, you must convince him to stop. Will you accept me? Will you allow me to work with you? Yes. And Alpha Moon? I will consider it, but... I must consult others. This is a typical tactic. He is an obstructionist. You can see that. Kalin Trose,... you may confer with your people, but we must have your answer within eight hours. You shall have it. His immune system is under attack. I can only guess he's suffering from classic rejection syndrome. Is there any treatment? An immuno-suppressant. It'll relieve the symptoms, but it can't correct the cause. There is a foreign organism in his body. Medical school didn't prepare me for situations like this. You're doing all you can. Don't worry about me, Captain, I'm fine. When you feel up to it, would you join me in my ready room? Of course. I can give you something that should help with the pain. At least for a little while. The pain's gone. Thank you. Please don't. Please let me touch you, just for a moment. No! Please! It was a fast decision which we must take as positive. The Alphan representative has agreed, however reluctantly, to let you mediate the dispute. I knew they would. They are reasonable people, they're just trapped in their anger. Have no doubt, however, that they will bolt if something goes wrong. It's my job to see that nothing does. Did I say something wrong? No, it's just that... for a moment, you sounded more like Will Riker. The new host will arrive in 18 hours. Will you be alright until then? Dr Beverly's medication has helped. I will find a way to keep going. Lemon tea. Computer, location of Dr Beverly Crusher? Dr Crusher is in her quarters. Can you make balso tonic? There is no formula on record. Please supply a molecular structure. Never mind. Come in. I thought I should see how you were doing. If you needed another hypospray? I don't think so. The symptoms haven't returned. Well, that's good. Yes. Tomorrow's an important day. Do you feel ready for it? I'll be fine. I've been preparing. That's good. Yes. I'll check your vital signs in the morning before the representatives get here. I don't want them knowing that I'm taking any medication. Maybe you could schedule a series of breaks. That's good. Yes. Beverly, I want you. If you are going to leave, go now. I'm not leaving! Captain's log, star date 44824.4. Governor Leka and the representatives are ready to transport. We have learned that they each have troops ready for combat if this final effort at peace is not successful. White count is back up, temperature is elevated. The effects of the medication are wearing off faster every time. I'll administer one now and hope it will hold for an hour or so. No, no more. Ambassador, it's clear you're in pain, you can't get through without help. I must. Are the injections damaging to Riker's body? Yes. We can't put him through any further risk. But how can you function, conduct the meeting? I'll manage. We'll respect your wishes. One more thing. I will conduct the mediations today,... ..but at the end of today, regardless of the outcome, I must be removed from Riker's body, even if the new host has not arrived. But you won't survive. Riker will not survive if I am not removed. He has done enough. Your word? Very well. Worf to Captain Picard. Yes, Mr. Worf? The representatives have returned. I will escort them to the observation lounge. Thank you. I'll stand by with medication, just in case. The pain may become so intense... Beverly. Whatever else I may be to you, I'm your friend. I can only imagine what you're going through, and I want you to know... I'm here. Jean-Luc. Computer, what is the time? 1535 hours. They've been in there for almost six hours. Captain, a message from the ship carrying the Trill host. Are they here, Worf? They are experiencing difficulty. They anticipate arriving in another nine hours. Nine hours? It was worth it. Ambassador! They will not go to war. Mr. Worf, escort the representatives off the ship. Ensign, set a course to intercept the Trill vessel. Sir, it could take more than two hours to reach. I must remove him. I gave my word. Will is gonna be alright. He has stabilized and he's sleeping now. How is Odan? I've placed him in stasis, he's fine for the moment. You need some rest, Doctor. No. If Odan is to survive, he needs to be implanted in the new host as soon as he arrives. It'll be some time. I know. Doctor. Is the Trill host here? Yes. Good. Bring him in. Doctor? I am Kareel. I am to become host to Odan. The operation to implant Odan into the new host was completed at 1900, and appears to have been successful. There were no difficulties in assimilation. Dr Beverly, could we talk for a moment? You should be sleeping, you need to rest. I've never felt better, except once or twice. My poor Beverly. This has been so hard for you. I want to thank you, for your caring, for your standing by me. I congratulate you. You averted a war that would have cost many lives. Yes. It seems as though everything has turned out for the best. And, yes, I am still Odan, and I still love you. I cannot imagine that ever changing. I am glad that you're alright. Is there to be nothing more? Perhaps... it is a human failing, but we are not accustomed to these kinds of changes. I can't keep up. How long will you have this host? What would the next one be? I can't live with that kind of uncertainty. Perhaps, someday,... ..our ability to love... ..won't be so limited. I understand. Odan,... ..l do love you. Please, remember that. I will never forget you. "
S4E24,"Personal log, Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge, star date 44885.5. I'm en route to Risa for an artificial-intelligence seminar. The Captain has ordered me to arrive early, to have fun. I shall follow his orders to the best of my ability. How about some different music, Computer? With a Latin beat. No, something with a gentle Latin beat. Maybe Spanish guitar. Perfect. What's the weather like on Risa? Risa is climate-controlled for optimum tourist comfort. Is that right? How long till we get there? Arrival at Risa is scheduled for 0932 hours. Three hours. How about a game? Please restate request. Something to pass the time, a diversion. Select either visual interactive or verbal interactive. Verbal. 20 seconds for each question. Level of difficulty increases as you progress. Proceed when ready. Begin. List the resonances of the sub-quantum states associated with transitional relativity. That's easy! In alphabetical order. Asymmetrical... Inverted... Phased... Stable... Your time has expired. The fifth resonance is... Universal. I knew that. OK. Give me another one. List warp modulation field patterns in order of decreasing energy. There's the aft nacelle associative, the full... Computer! Sequence 010. Maximum power to the shields, kill the music. Enterprise, I've encountered a Romulan warbird. Coordinates at three... Warning! Shield failure. Damn! Risa control! Anybody! Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, star date 4489 1.6. The Enterprise has been ordered to accompany an emissary from the Klingon High Council to the Kriosian system, where one of their colonies is fighting for independence. There was a time when the Empire would crush a rebellion. Now it is tolerated. We have enough troubles. We don't wish to divert resources to such a trivial war. You'll give them independence? Perhaps. Conquer them again later, if we wish. May I ask, what has this to do with us? The Governor has charged that the Federation is aiding the rebels. Does he have evidence? Council has sent me to examine that evidence. It was my decision to invite you to accompany me. Many on the Council have great respect for you. K'adlo. I have been happy to offer occasional assistance to the Klingons. Your modesty is very human, Captain. I will excuse it. I can assure you, Ambassador, the Federation would never interfere in the affairs of the Empire. Let us hope not. It would strike at the basis of our alliance. Captain, we are in the war zone. Indeed. Ambassador, I will ask Lt Worf to make a report... Captain, Worf's discommendation makes that very awkward. If I could work with another officer... Lt Worf is Chief of Security and my tactical officer. This matter clearly falls within his jurisdiction. As you wish. Take it easy! Welcome, Mr. La Forge. We've waited a long time to meet you. You've gone to a lot of trouble. Indeed we have. You will be a great help to us. I wouldn't count on it. Good. Very good. Do not enjoy yourself too much on Risa. Your visor will be returned. First, I want to show you something. Show me something? A nice trick. I can't see anything without the visor. That is not quite true. Allow me to demonstrate. I now have direct access to his visual cortex. He has no choice but to see what I wish. I can feed him any image. He will be unable to ignore it. His galvanic skin response has increased nine percent. It seems La Forge, like many humans, has a low tolerance for watching others suffer. Why are you doing this? I'm sorry, Commander. It is a necessary step. I apologize for your discomfort. Observe how a spring day on his native Earth affects him. He's looking at a beautiful meadow, green trees, birds, a blue sky. The heartbeat slows. The galvanic skin response drops. The body responds to our stimuli. He is incapable of maintaining control of his own responses. Watch as I change the stimuli again. Once our work is done, La Forge will act normally, unaware of his conditioning. The perfect tool for our purpose. Will there be any physical evidence? None, Commander. That is why we chose La Forge. The utilization of his pre-existing neural implants makes our work impossible to detect. How will we be certain of success? I will program him to perform a series of tests, both before he leaves us and after he returns. We'll be able to verify his effectiveness. Notice that his heart rate has slowed. He is becoming accustomed to the horrors he is witnessing. So... ..we change horrors. There have been two rebel attacks on neutral freighters. One Ferengi, the other Cardassian. Both were engaged near the Ikalian asteroid belt. That's where the rebels must be hiding. The actinides in the asteroids protect them from our sensors. They might attack a freighter, but I doubt they would challenge a Federation starship. Especially with the Federation furnishing them support. You would test the Captain's word with me, Kell? Is it because I have no honour that you expect me to be disloyal? Wrong of me to ask. My apologies. Capt Picard does not lie. If he says there is no Federation assistance, there is none. Good. I risked my own reputation and honour coming to Picard. He will not disappoint you. If that is all... Some members of the High Council would thank you, Worf. Thank me? For killing Duras. No doubt, had he lived, he would have headed the Council. Many did not look forward to that. My motives were personal, not political. Motives? Who cares for motives? Humans, perhaps. What matters is you acted on that day as a true Klingon. Thanks. Where are we, Mr. La Forge? This is ten-forward. Who is that man over there? That's Chief O'Brien. How long has he served with you? Almost four years. I want you to kill him. OK. Take this phaser and kill Chief O'Brien. Finally, I think I've found it... ..the power to transporter seven... Freeze simulations. Commander, did you understand my request? Well, l... It's just... I don't... Look at me. What did I ask you to do? Kill Chief O'Brien. Then do as I asked. Resume program. Chief. Good, Mr. La Forge. Very good. Why don't you enjoy a drink with your friends? Mind if I join you, guys? Sure. He still hesitated. Prepare the equipment for another session. Captain's log, star date 44896.9. We are orbiting Krios, awaiting the Klingon governor. Cmdr La Forge has rejoined the Enterprise from Risa. Welcome back, Geordi. Data! How was the seminar? Very informative! I'll tell you about it. It is fortunate we could coordinate your return on the cruiser. When I heard the Enterprise went to Krios, I thought I might be forced to endure a few more weeks on Risa. I'm sorry you did not enjoy yourself. I was joking. Joking? ""Forced to endure."" Your actual intent was to emphasize that you did enjoy yourself. Yes. I see how that could be considered quite amusing. I missed you, Data! Cmdr La Forge. Permission to come aboard. Granted. Welcome back. Thank you, sir. Cmdr La Forge is my chief engineer. He's been attending a seminar on artificial intelligence on Risa. I'm glad we got you back. We need you. Data tells me the Federation has been accused of aiding rebels. We are seeing evidence today. We need your help in analyzing it. Anything I can do. You had a good time. Does it show? You're more relaxed than I've ever seen you. Captain, Governor Vagh is ready to meet with you. Very well. We will transport down to the surface immediately. Ambassador. Cmdr Riker. What is it, Data? Our sensors detect an energy fluctuation in the E-band. The E-band? That's unusual. What's the source? Unknown, sir. E-band emissions are difficult to localize. Collapsing protostars can emit E-band bursts. Yes, sir. There are no protostars in this sector. Better do a complete scan. Yes, sir. The Carnelians have done the most work on artificial intelligence. I spent a lot of time in their seminars. I get the feeling something special happened on this vacation. I'm not talking about computers. I did take second place in a chess tournament. And I swam a lot. The water is very calm on Risa. And? And I walked a lot. That's all. I ate enough for 12 people. The food is terrific. They've got a chocolate that you would love. And that's all? Yeah. There was this... Yes? Her name is Jonek. But you wouldn't want to hear about that. Better get ready for duty. Nice talking to you. We talk, we socialize, we waste time, and the insurrection continues to grow. These rebels need to be crushed, not coddled. Governor, it does not matter what you or I think. The High Council's wishes are clear. The Council should be more interested in Federation interference. Governor, what do you think the Federation has done? Your medical supplies have reached the rebels. We make no effort to restrict medical supplies. Are your weapons also freely available? No, they are not! Then explain this. You took this from the rebels? That and many more like it. It does appear to be Federation issue. Governor, I would like to take this to verify its origin. As you wish. I have hundreds more. Even if these are genuine, a third party must have been involved. The Federation is not in the business of supplying arms to rebels. This is the only Klingon colony on the border of Federation space. You cannot deny that Starfleet would be happy to see Krios gain its independence. It would reduce your vulnerability to an attack. Governor, you speak as if we are enemies, not allies. And you speak the lies of a taar'chek! Gentlemen! You swear well, Picard. You must have Klingon blood in your veins. Governor, I will report to you when analysis of that weapon is complete. Captain, Commander... Enterprise, three to transport. Inter-cooler flux down to five percent. Plasma deviation steady at 0.72. Aye, sir. If you keep up this efficiency, I'll go back to Risa. Just run through a level-four series, then call it a night. I'd help you but there's something I've got to do. Red Torian, please. Thank you. I'm sorry! My glass, it just slipped. It's nothing. Just cold. But you're all soaked! It's nothing serious. Let me wipe it up. I'll change. You sure? Don't think about it, Commander. Energy flow is within normal parameters, from the pre-fire chamber to the aperture. Rapid nadion pulse, right on target. Beam-control assembly, safety interlock. Both checked out. Beam-width intensity controls also responding correctly. Energy-cell usage constant at 1.05 megajoules per second. Curious. The efficiency reading is well above Starfleet specifications. Yeah, by quite a bit. 94.1 percent efficiency. Our most efficient discharge crystal fires with 86.5 percent efficiency. Let's look at the wave pattern of the emission. That might tell us why. Pulse frequency out of pre-fired chamber reads steady. There! That's not right. The initial output spike is inverted. That suggests the weapon has been charged with a forced pulse, well into the terahertz range. Then it's definitely not Starfleet issue. There can't be many systems that use terahertz. 327, to our knowledge. We can probably achieve a match with a computer search. It will take approximately three hours. I think we can narrow this down with common sense. Who has the most to gain from a conflict between the Klingon Empire and the Federation? The Romulans. They fashioned a perfect rifle but charged it from their own sources. So the discharge crystal and the emission correspond to those in a Romulan disruptor. The Romulans have no interest in Kriosian independence. This planet is too far away. They would want to drive the Federation and the Empire apart. Our alliance is all that has kept them in check. Romulan replications using stolen Federation technology? It's a typical Romulan ploy. An attempt to sow dissension and mistrust. Commander, you've done very well. I thank you on behalf of the Empire. I still have my doubts, Picard. I want my own technicians to confirm your findings. Of course. My staff will give their full cooperation. You may go. Another E-band blip? Yes, sir, but at a different intensity. It did not originate in the same location. If it's changed intensity, it can't be a protostar. That is a reasonable assumption. Is there any known instance of the Romulans using E-band? Not to my knowledge, sir. Can you track the source? We can reconfigure the primary sensor array. If we narrow the scan to E-band, we might be able to calculate a directional vector. But only for more occurrences. Do it. Computer, reroute the power in the cargo-bay-four transporter to the auxiliary replicator system. Please verify command with necessary protocol. Initiate protocol 364-B. Verified priority clearance. Recognize La Forge, data 2997. Acknowledged. Power has been rerouted through power-distribution system code number 44762. Now, redirect transporter mode to the planetary sensor array. Transporter mode has been redirected. Verify that all record of these modifications are being erased. Affirmative. Erasure process is proceeding. Sir, we are being hailed by Governor Vagh. On screen, Mr. Worf. Governor. You astonish me, Picard. Did you believe you would succeed, that we are blind? I don't understand. We intercepted the weapons you tried to transport. Governor, I assure you... Do not insult us both by denying it. Maintain your position. Do not attempt to leave orbit. Klingon attack cruiser uncloaking, sir. On screen. Two birds of prey approaching. Sensors confirm an unauthorized transporter beam at 1123 hours. Do you know which transporter? I'm not sure. Whoever did it used the planetary array to bypass the sensors. And the transporter logs? They're blank. How many people are capable of this? I'm not even sure how it was done yet. As soon as I find out, I can give you an answer. Not many. Vagh is fully prepared to open fire. I have convinced him not to act without consulting the High Council. How long do we have? A few hours. Mr. La Forge, recommendations? It might be possible to trace power flows at the time of transport. Make it so. The primary plasma system does not indicate a power drain. Then whoever used it must have bypassed the primary feeds. Tracking power from the secondary systems. No surges to the transporters indicated. Damn! Who could have pulled this off? Try the life-support power flows. No abnormal surges indicated. Replicator wave guides? There! That's not a replicator energy pattern. Trace it. Cargo bay four. Security to cargo bay four. I've run a level-one diagnostic. The unit wasn't tampered with. This has to be the transfer point. Perhaps they reprogrammed the memory chips to erase any record. You're talking about 30 or 40 chips in half-a-dozen systems. Which crew members could do that? I think I could have done it. The Chief, Data, Lt Costa. That's it. Procedure requires that I ask where you were at 1123 hours. I was with Keiko, in the arboretum. I was on the bridge. I was in my quarters. Was anyone with you? No, I was alone. Costa was on duty. I'm sure he's got 20 witnesses. Then someone on board isn't what he or she seems to be. Data, let's do a detailed scan on every chip. There's got to be some trail we can follow. The isolinear chips were altered? Programmed to erase all commands once the transfer was complete. With the chips erased, what evidence remained? The erasures were complete. An analysis of the subatomic structure revealed an almost undetectable residual pattern. We could reconstruct the perpetrator's authorization code. Do you have any ideas? No, sir. Everyone with the necessary skills has an alibi, except for me. I was alone in my quarters. Then whoever did this must have been specially trained. Our forensic team is trying to identify anyone who was there today. It won't be easy. A lot of people were there. Riker to Data. Yes, Commander? Sensors have picked up another E-emission. Acknowledged. I will be there shortly. E-band emission? We have been picking up a curious intermittent blip. Cmdr Riker has speculated it is a Romulan transmission. I'm tracking its source. Proceed. Thank you, Mr. La Forge. We do not have much time. Vagh is not noted for his patience. Assure him that we are doing everything possible and advise him that, if necessary, I will defend my ship. With your permission, I will transport down. Of course. May I suggest you invite Governor Vagh to personally witness your ongoing investigation? Do you think he will come? I will try to ensure that he does. Qapla', Picard. Qapla', Ambassador. Come in, Mr. La Forge. The investigation is moving too fast. You're in danger of being exposed. I will transport to the surface and return with Governor Vagh. Your captain will bring him to the cargo bay. I want you to kill him there in front of witnesses. Use a hand phaser. When he is dead, you will claim that you acted on behalf of Starfleet, in support of Kriosian independence. I understand. La Forge to O'Brien. Go ahead, Commander. What can I do for you? Nothing. Chief, I'm sorry to disturb you. I'm sorry. Hiya, Doc. Geordi. What can I do for you? I just can't seem to get any sleep. I hope you can help. Sit down. Let's take a look. You couldn't sleep at all? I was restless. I kept waking up. Would you take off your visor, please? Is there something on your mind? No. I don't think so. Well, everybody goes through bouts of insomnia. It's probably nothing. Let's make sure there's nothing physically wrong. There's a minor vascular irregularity in the visual cortex. A slight dilation of the blood vessels. Nothing serious. What about your visor? Has it been giving you problems? Nothing out of the ordinary. Still, it might be good to have it examined at Star base 36 next month. In the meantime, I will get you a somnetic inducer to put by your bed. Thanks, Doc. I'm sure I'll be fine. Energize. Governor Vagh, thank you for coming. You can thank Ambassador Kell. I am here against my better judgement. Captain, I think that the Governor should see the investigation under way in the cargo bay. Of course. From inside the Enterprise? The first and third blips were clearly generated onboard the ship. The second came from the surface. Generated by what? Unknown, sir. We have a known spy and unexplained signals on board. It's reasonable to assume they're related. One could speculate that the E-band is a form of communication. We need more than speculation. We need to know who, when, why. Or we may go to war. Yes, sir. Computer. Run an analysis of all known Romulan transmission formats. All bands. Identify commonalities with displayed wave form. No commonalities noted. Does this wave form match any known format? Negative. Broaden search beyond communications. Does the wave pattern conform to any natural phenomenon, cryptographic formats or life-form emissions? The signal corresponds to a wavelength spectrum similar to human neural frequencies. As in a human-brainwave pattern? Affirmative. What kind of receiver could process these signals? A system designed to modify the electromagnetic spectrum and carry messages directly to the human brain. Computer. Link with the shuttle's onboard system. Access the isolinear storage assembly. Scan all chips which contain mission logs. Note any discrepancies. No discrepancies noted. Perform a level-five diagnostic on navigational and power systems. The components specified are all within normal tolerances. My technicians have examined all of the transporters, sir. I can assure you, only this unit has been tampered with. Computer, scan the shuttle's structural integrity. Submicroscopic deformations are present in the nose section and the aft thrusters. Probable cause of these variations? The shuttle has been subjected to stress from a tractor beam. All our transporter containers have a slight impurity in the structural alloys which allows us to trace our material. Cmdr La Forge. What, Chief? Could you look at the buffers? With what's happened, I'm not sure they are reliable. Sure. Let's take a look. Computer, I am reading anomalous variations in the molecular structure of these memory chips. Confirm. Analysis confirmed. Probable cause? Replication. Compare these variations with Romulan replication patterns. The patterns are identical. Maybe we should run a diagnostic on those coils. Right, Commander. Data to La Forge. Report, please. Geordi! Please respond. Computer, current location of Cmdr La Forge. Cargo bay four. Data to Lt Worf, priority one. Go ahead. Take Cmdr La Forge into custody. Sir? That is an order. Mr. Worf, get him out. Arming our enemies is not enough. Now the Federation would murder me to achieve its aims. Governor, if I could explain this, I would. I believe I can help, Captain. I have determined that La Forge was abducted by Romulans en route to Risa. It is likely that he was somehow forced to take part in the plot. I saw no evidence of Romulans. We just witnessed him acting alone. No, sir, you did not. I do not believe the Commander is acting of his own accord. He has been receiving signals through his visor. Signals which carry direct commands to his brain. I have surmised that La Forge was conditioned by Romulans, a process referred to historically, and inaccurately, as brainwashing. To what end? Why would the Romulans kill me? The Romulans want to destroy the Federation-Klingon alliance. If Mr. La Forge had killed you, they might have succeeded. Who sent these signals? A cloaked Romulan ship? No, sir. That is not possible. The signals had to be transmitted close to the visor. Are you suggesting an accomplice in close proximity to Mr. La Forge? Yes, sir. This Romulan accomplice, who is he? I have narrowed the list to the only two people with Cmdr La Forge all three times a transmission was recorded. Capt Picard and Ambassador Kell. One of them may be concealing an E-band transmitter. If they agree to be searched... I am a Klingon! An emissary of the High Council. I will not be searched by anyone on this ship. I am forced to agree, Captain. We will take the Ambassador with us and search him ourselves. Captain, I believe it to be in all our interests if I remain aboard. I formally request asylum. I will certainly grant you asylum. When you have been absolved of this crime. But I remember everything! There was this one night, this Andorian waiter, he couldn't get our orders right. It did happen! I remember being on Risa. I know you do. Just take that memory and put it aside for a moment. Tell me everything you remember about the shuttlecraft trip after you left the Enterprise. Well, I was just trying to get in the mood. I played music. I talked to the computer. You know those long trips. When you saw the Romulan ship, did you call us? No, the first thing I did... Wait a minute. But that's... It'll take time, Geordi. A long time. But we will reconstruct your memory. Together. I'm just not sure. About anything. Believe it or not, that's a good sign. A beginning. Now, let's go back to the shuttlecraft. There was a Romulan ship. The first thing you did was...? "
S4E25,"Captain's log, star date 44932.3. The Enterprise is preparing to enter the Mar Oscura, an unexplored dark-matter nebula. Cmdr Data is modifying several photon torpedoes for an experiment to elicit information about this unusual phenomenon. The initial dispersal pattern should not be more than 7 km in diameter. Jenna? 6.8 km. That should suffice. Is something occupying your thoughts? You seem subdued. I bumped into Jeff in the turbolift this morning. He asked me to dinner. What was your response? I told him I'd think about it. As you requested,... ..l will now remind you why you ended your relationship. I guess I asked for this! Go ahead. You objected that he did not set aside time for you. You said he was unresponsive. He never did ""the little things"". You disliked the sound he made eating soup. OK! I remember. This is the third time I have refreshed your memory. Do you wish to rescind our agreement? No, it's for my own good. It's just so easy to forget. Hand me the sequencer. Throughout history, lovers have suffered the same difficulty. Anne Boleyn was distressed that Henry VIII preferred the company of his huntsmen. When did you develop an interest in romantic historical figures? Six weeks ago, when you dissolved your relationship, I saw an excellent opportunity to study human intimacy. As your friend, it is my responsibility to be supportive. That's... That's very sweet, Data. Data to bridge. We are ready to begin the first test. Acknowledged. All science stations, stand by. We're about to light up the nebula. Launch bay one shows ready. Fire torpedo. It's beautiful. Like watching fireworks when I was a little girl. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ...to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. That was wonderful! Really? Really! Wonderful! Is something wrong? My tempo was off. I felt like I rushed through the piece. I do not believe that is so. Your rhythmic control has improved. I heard no fluctuations during the performance. Well, maybe. But I ruined the coda. I got confused with the phrasing again. I kept breathing at the wrong times. The contrapuntal nature of the composition is demanding. We will focus on the rhythmic patterns at our next rehearsal. However, I am certain the audience was oblivious to such nuances. They seemed to enjoy the performance thoroughly. Thank you, Data. You're very generous. Every night, Miles leaves his socks on the floor. When we got married, I made the mistake of picking them up. Then I realized if I kept it up, I'd do it for the rest of my life. So I stopped, figuring he'd get the point and do it himself. One night goes by. Two. A week. Ten days! By now, there's a pile half-a-metre high. It wasn't! I couldn't stand it any more. I bundled them into the cleaning processor. And I'm still doing it! And a very good job she does, too! Keiko, you sound like Data! When he came over for a music lesson he said the funniest thing. How did you put it? About the mess? I believe I observed you have an aversion to orderliness. But it was not intended as a humorous remark. So, before we started, he gallantly offered to help me straighten up. And a very good job I did, too. Report, Mr. Data. I have nearly finished compiling readings of the illuminatory burst. Dark-matter density is nearly one order of magnitude higher than in similar nebulae. Life forms here may have developed in ways never observed. Interesting hypothesis. Are there any M-Class planets? Several, sir. The nearest is three light hours from our position. It's worth a look. We'll continue our survey along the way. Let's increase the flow rate and see if that helps. Sometimes, in the summer, we'd go on cookouts. My little brother, me and my mother. She was hopeless without a replicator. We didn't care. Children often do not develop discerning palates until adolescence. It wasn't that. It's just we felt so good as a family. We didn't have much of that after my father died. So those times were really special. I wish we were back there now. The unidirectional nature of the time continuum makes that unlikely. That's what I love about you. You make me laugh. I don't know why I fall for the wrong man, and not somebody like you. You're perfect. That is not true. I have no human feelings. But you give me so much. You spend time with me when I'm lonely, you encourage me. No man has ever been kinder to me. Those are the things that matter. I'd better be going. With your permission, Commander. Permission granted. I don't know if you're aware of this. You're very handsome. I'll see you tomorrow. Hello, Data. Would you like to try something new? It's a concoction I heard about on Prakal II. I think it's wonderful but I need a second opinion. 87 percent Saurian brandy. Targ milk and Danisian meat comprise the rest. There is an unusually high concentration of fructose compound. Too sweet? Data, if I didn't know you better, I would say you were a little... preoccupied. Lt D'Sora just gave me what could be considered a very passionate kiss in the torpedo bay. Really? And? I was intrigued. Jenna seemed to display genuine affection for me. Well, what do you think of her, Data? I find her to be a competent officer, highly motivated, though lacking in her understanding of the theory of the dilithium-matrix application. I meant personally. I look forward to our time together. Well, then it seems the next move is yours. What are you going to do? I do not know. I have no experience in such matters. I require advice. Don't look at me! No, Data, I simply mean that I can't give you any advice. It's not good to advise people about their first love affairs. That's something people have to figure out themselves. But I am not capable of love. Then it's going to be a very unique experience. Missing someone? I found Spot wandering two sections away. Thank you. Forget to secure the door? The door sensor recognizes only humanoid forms for entrance and egress. Spot could not trigger it. Maybe somebody came in while you were away, let him out by accident. Has anything been disturbed? It does not appear so. Computer. Has anyone been in my quarters other than Cmdr La Forge and myself? Negative. That's really strange. To be on the safe side, I should report a possible unauthorized entry. Geordi? May I ask your advice... ..in a personal matter? Sure, Data. Should I pursue a relationship with Lt D'Sora? I thought she and Jeff... They have discontinued their association. She has made the first move to initiate a relationship with me. What should I do? Boy! She's just coming out of a bad situation. You know, sometimes, it takes people a while, Data. But then, if they jump into another relationship, that can be trouble, unless she's really ready, then I guess it depends on whether you're really serious. This can be a little complicated. My advice is... ..ask somebody else for advice. At least someone who's got experience at giving advice. I think you should be careful. This isn't just some experiment you're running, Data. Jenna is a living, breathing person with needs and feelings to be considered. Then you do not believe I should pursue this? I didn't say that. I just want you to be aware that this is unlike any more casual relationship that you've attempted. I have studied much human literature on the subject of love. There are many role models. Ultimately, Jenna will care for you for who you are, not what you imitate from a book. My programming may be inadequate to the task. We're all more than the sum of our parts. You'll have to be more than the sum of your programming. Klingons do not pursue relationships. They conquer that which they desire. However,... ..Lt D'Sora serves under my command. If she were mistreated, I would be very displeased, sir. I understand. I think you should pursue it. She's a beautiful woman. She seems to be crazy about you. Jenna has demonstrated how she feels. But I cannot return those feelings. Data. When you get involved with another person, there are always risks of disappointment, of getting hurt. I cannot be hurt. But she can. Jenna knows that and has decided to take the chance. When it works, it's not like anything you've ever experienced. The rewards are far greater than simple friendship. How far? That's what I hope you'll find out. Captain. I am seeking advice in... Yes, I've heard, Data. I'd be delighted to offer any advice I can on understanding women. When I have some I'll let you know. Second Officer's personal log, star date 44935.6. After conferring with my colleagues on romantic love in general, and my own situation in particular, I have reached a decision. They're lovely! Come in. What are they? A variety of crystilia. Their fragrance is an evolutionary response to the acrid atmosphere on Telemarius IV. You silver-tongued devil! Why don't I find a place to put these? Which won't be easy. It seems your quarters have reverted to their earlier state. I know. I'm hopeless. There! They're beautiful, Data. It's really sweet of you. Cmdr Riker suggested this flower. He said it had worked for him. You didn't talk to the entire ship about us? No. In actuality, less than one percent of the crew was involved. It was necessary to balance theory with experiential reference. Both are required for a program of this nature. Computer. Decrease illumination level by one-third standard lux. This is all part of a program? Yes. One which I have created for romantic relationships. So, I'm just a small variable... ..in one of your new computational environments? You are more than that. I have written a subroutine for you. A program within a program. I have devoted a considerable share of my resources to it. That's the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me. Estimated time of arrival, Mr. Data? We will reach the class-M planet in approximately 11 hours. You have the bridge. Picard to Lt Worf. Yes, Captain. Step into my ready room. And bring a tricorder. Aye, Captain. Captain? What do you make of this? I am puzzled, sir. So am l. The only detectable bioelectrical residuals are your own. You did not...? No, I did not. Perhaps we have a poltergeist. Sir? A mischievous spirit. Sir... Perhaps not. I cannot explain how an intruder entered this room. I recommend a red alert. Not yet. Then I will order my officers to stand watch. That's alright. I think, for now, circumstances warrant caution, nothing more. As you wish, Captain. Enter. I know it's a little unexpected. You are correct. I did not anticipate your arrival until 1900 hours. I couldn't wait. I wanted you to have this. You have expressed dissatisfaction with my spartan quarters. Is this an attempt at embellishment? The cat's out of the bag! Spot? No, I mean you've caught me in the act. I'm just trying to brighten things up around here. It's Tyrinean. What do you think? Its line is both fluid and formal yet retains an unpremeditated quality. The tactility of its surface is evocative of the neo-primitive period in Tyrinean blade carving. I hadn't thought of that. I'm sorry. Don't let me interrupt. As you wish. Data? Yes? The Book of Love, chapter four, paragraph 17. ""When your girlfriend arrives with a gift, stop whatever it is you're doing and give her your undivided attention."" I should not have resumed painting? No. Despite suggesting that I continue? Exactly. I have much to learn. Why don't we start with this? A critical analysis isn't necessarily the best response to a gift. Perhaps if I look for a place to display it? Much better. The ambient light in this location accentuates its contours. However, a gift should not necessarily be placed according to aesthetic criteria. A more central location would give added meaning. Data, what's important is that you're trying. You don't know how much that means to me. Why don't you go back to your painting? I really mean it this time. I'll see you tonight. Riker to Picard. You'd better come out here. Acknowledged. We're at the designated coordinates. But the M-class planet... ..it's gone. Are you sure there was no malfunction? Scanners register radiation levels indicative of a class-M planet. Sir. Mr. Data, run a systems diagnostic. Atmospheric decompression in observation lounge. Environmental compensation sequence has been initiated. I register no hull breach. Scan for life forms. None, sir. Captain, standard air pressure has been re-established. Let's have a look. Mr. Data? I do not understand. Are you picking anything up? No unusual readings along standard parameters. Curious. The aluminium alloy in this window is exhibiting a pattern of transient electrical currents. Explanation? I have none. The rate is like a subspace distortion but I am picking up no subspace field. Hold position while we seek an explanation. Let's divert all our resources to that end. Honey? I'm home! Hi. Hi. Any luck with your diagnostic? Negative. We found no malfunctions. We did a full security sweep. Nothing. May l... ..get you a drink, dear? Well, yes. I'll have a Calaman sherry. Excellent choice. I'll join you. Computer. Two... ..Calaman sherries. Would you care for some dinner? I'm too tired to think about it. Maybe later. Whatever you wish, dear. There we are. Darling... ..you remain as aesthetically pleasing as the first day we met. I believe I am the most fortunate sentient in this sector of the galaxy! Now, you... relax, put your feet up. and I will take care of everything. I could organize your closets. I have found that by grouping apparel first by function, then by colour, light to dark, one can more easily find one's desired choice. That's alright. You don't have to. But I am happy to do it. Just put them down. What do you wish me to do, dear? Am I not paying enough attention to you? No, that's not it... Perhaps I am not giving you enough compliments? Your hair... ..is looking particularly silky tonight. Data, there's something strange about the way you're acting. Am I not being a solicitous mate? Well, yes... Tending to your every need? What's wrong with you tonight? My most recent self-diagnostic revealed no malfunctions. Perhaps something is wrong with you! I have never seen you behave so foolishly! Why are you doing this? Don't tell me how to behave! You're not my mother! What?! ""You are not my mother."" That is the appropriate response for your statement. Data, I think you should just leave. You do not wish to continue our lovers' quarrel? Is that what this is? In my study of interpersonal dynamics, I have found that conflict, followed by emotional release, strengthens the connection between two people. But... ..there's something so forced and artificial about the way you're doing it. It's just not the real you. With regard to romantic relationships,... ..there is no real me. I am drawing upon cultural and literary sources to define my role. Kiss me. What were you just thinking? In that particular moment, I was reconfiguring the warp-field parameters, analyzing the collected works of Charles Dickens, calculating the maximum pressure I could apply to your lips, considering a new food supplement for Spot... I'm glad I was in there somewhere. A complete sensor scan of the planet came up with no surprises. No signs of life, nothing out of the ordinary. Seven more unusual incidents have been reported. No casualties or damage. We can only state that a subspace effect seems to exist. After analysis, I may be able to adjust the sensors to locate the anomaly. The ship is at risk here. We could investigate from outside the nebula. Agreed. Ensign, plot the most direct course ahead, warp one. Aye, sir. Captain. Captain! Explosive decompression on deck 37. Bridge to La Forge. Damage report. We're showing damage between decks. We haven't localized it yet. Thorne, are you alright? Yes, sir. Bridge, a cryogenic control-conduit just blew out on us. I almost lost a man. Ensign, full stop. Aye, sir. La Forge to bridge. Go ahead. I think we have some damage between decks 36 and 37. I'll check it out. Van Mayter, go to 23-M and look at those bridge connectors. Thorne, I'll cover the aft section. You go down... Captain's log, supplemental. This series of unexplained events has resulted in a death. But Mr. Data may have an explanation. During the last occurrence, I confirmed one of my hypotheses. The unusual preponderance of dark matter in this nebula is causing small gaps in the fabric of normal space. As the Enterprise moves through this nebula, it is colliding with these deformations. So, every time we hit one, part of the ship phases out of normal space. Or when one of them hits us. Our reading suggests that the deformations are in motion. It's a good thing one didn't pass through a photon-torpedo casing. The question is, how do we get out? Could you reconfigure the sensors to detect these anomalies? Yes, sir. But only at extremely close range. Even at minimal speed, it is almost impossible to manoeuvre quickly enough to avoid them. A shuttlecraft is more manoeuvrable. He's right. Position the shuttlecraft in front of the Enterprise. It could detect the pockets. We could manoeuvre out of the way. We could give the shuttle control of our navigational systems. The corresponding manoeuvres would be almost instantaneous. Make it so. I'll do pre-flight on board. Not this time. I want you on the bridge. Sir? I'm going to pilot the shuttle. Captain, it is my duty to safeguard the lives on this ship, including yours. The Enterprise can't afford to lose you. I believe our best chance is for me to pilot the shuttle. It's my ship, Will. I've got to do this. Sir. Shuttle three to Enterprise. Telemetry link enabled. Ship's computer is accepting inputs from the shuttle. Forward sensors are on line. Ensign, plot a course for the shortest distance out of the nebula. Plot laid in, sir. Outer perimeter at 32 million kilometres. 0.1 impulse, Number One. Acknowledged. We're behind you. Riker to O'Brien. Lock on to the Captain so I can pull him out. Aye, sir. Changing course. New heading, 299 mark 029. Main coupling is matching navigational inputs. New heading confirmed. I missed it by less than 1,000 metres. Advise your status. Sensors indicate deformation passing 500 metres off the starboard bow. One down, Captain. Resuming previous course. Confirmed. Out of perimeter now at 30.1 million kilometres. Changing course. Heading 073 mark 288. New heading, 284 mark 013... I'm losing manoeuvrability. Sensors indicate damage to the shuttle's starboard impulse-nacelle. I'm rerouting the secondary deuterium supply. Switching to manual control. Transceiver signal is down 42 percent. Navigational inputs not registering. We've lost our link, Captain. You'll have to make course changes manually for now. Understood. Mr. Data, get us back on line. Geordi, try boosting power to the LU bands. McKnight, increase distance to the shuttle. We're going to need room to make adjustments. New heading, 299 mark 18. Yes, sir. Course corrected. Enterprise, hard starboard! Aye, sir. Deformation impact on deck 15, science section. Damage? Reports coming in. Minimal damage. Mr. La Forge. I'm still having difficulty controlling her. Your storage cells are losing their charge. You will start to lose manual control. Estimated distance to perimeter? 4. 7 million kilometres. Is there a way to transfer microfusion to get power? Possibly, if you augment the thruster sequencer. Relative bearing 27... Make that 285 mark 255. Commander, the shuttle is out of control. Mr. O'Brien, do you have the Captain's signal? I'm having trouble locking on, sir. The shuttle's dampeners have failed. It is breaking up. Let's get him out! Now would be a good time, Mr. O'Brien. Did we get him back? Aye, sir, we got him. I'm dizzy but none the worse. I'm on my way. Acknowledged, sir. Commander, we are nearing the perimeter. One million kilometres. Alright. Let's make a run for it. Aye, sir. We're clear, sir. Ensign, plot a course for Star base 260, warp two. Aye, sir. Engage. Enter. Hi. Hi. The place looks great. Thank you. It is much less spartan, is it not? Much less. It looks great, it really does. It looks... great. Jenna, you are repeating yourself. This is often indicative of mental distraction. Is that correct in this instance? I'm afraid it is. Perhaps we should eat. Among humans, a low serum-glucose level... Data, I think we should talk. Could you sit down? I'm not sure how to begin. What is the subject? You and l. Our relationship. Yes? Data. Sometimes people blindly make the same mistake again and again. Are you experiencing this phenomenon? I didn't see it until today. I got out of a relationship with an unemotional man... ..and I got right back into another one,... ..with a man who's absolutely incapable of emotion. There does appear to be a recurring motif. You were so kind and attentive. I thought that would be enough. Is it not? No, it's not. Because as close as we are... ..l don't really matter to you. Not really. Nothing I can say or do will ever make you happy or sad. Or touch you in any way. That is a valid projection. It is apparent that my reach has exceeded my grasp. I am, perhaps, not nearly so human as I aspire to become. If you are ready, I will bring our meal. No, that's alright, Data. I'm going to go now. As you wish. Jenna. Are we no longer... a couple? No, we're not. Then I will delete the appropriate program. I'll see you later. Hello, Spot. "
S4E26,"Captain's log, star date 44995.3. We're en route to the Klingon homeworld for the installation ceremony of Gowron, the next leader of the High Council. This visit should also allow one of my officers to correct a grave injustice. Enter. Am I intruding? No, sir. My apologies, I can be back in uniform... That's not necessary, Mr. Worf. I'm not here as your captain. I'm here as the man who stood with you before the High Council. The Cha'Dlch. We will arrive at your homeworld in less than a day. It is not time yet. That doesn't sound like the man who came to me a year ago fiercely determined to return home to clear his father's name. Isn't it time to confront the Council? To regain your family name? Let the truth be known? I have been told that patience is sometimes a more effective weapon than the sword. Patience is a human virtue, one that I'm glad to see you've taken to heart. But doesn't this situation require a more... Klingon response? Your discommendation is a facade to protect less honourable men. It is a lie. Lies must be challenged. I have grown weary of bearing this dishonour. Riker to Picard. Go ahead, Number One. We've been intercepted by the Klingon vessel Bortas. It claims to be our escort. No escort was scheduled. The Bortas is standing by. On screen. Gowron! An unexpected pleasure. I must speak with you, Picard. We must move quickly to be successful. Successful? Yes. In preventing a Klingon civil war. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. The family of Duras is massing support. They have many allies on the Council. Duras died in disgrace. By tradition, his family should share that disgrace. Their corruption has poisoned the Empire. Honour will soon have no meaning. And who speaks for his family now? Lursa and B'Etor - the sisters of Duras. They claim the Council leadership? Women may not serve on the Council. Then how... I don't know! But they are plotting something. They have secured the loyalty of at least three fleet commanders. Lursa and B'Etor are feared. And fear is power. I do not see how I can assist. You were first chosen as Arbiter of Succession because no Klingon could be trusted. You accepted this duty and you must see it through to the end. You must ensure my installation. That is beyond my purview. You will not support me? I will not step outside the traditional role of the Arbiter. And if they attempt to block my installation? Then I can only assure you that I will deal with any challenge according to Klingon law. I fear... that will not be enough. Mr. Worf, would you escort our guest to the transporter room? Monitor Romulan activity along the Neutral Zone, Mr. Data. Have the outposts send tactical reports. Aye, sir. The Duras family are preparing to move against Gowron. Backed by Romulans? I don't know. There is too much history between the Duras and the Romulans to discount the possibility. Dismissed. I would speak with you. I do not hear the words of traitors. I am not a traitor. You admitted your guilt before the Council. I accepted discommendation to protect the Empire. Protect it? How? Duras' father betrayed our people to the Romulans at Khitomer, not mine. Duras? There is proof of this? There is. Why would you accept dishonour to protect Duras? His family was too powerful. To expose him would have split the Empire. Instead, the Council chose to blame my father. The Council knew? I believe you to be a man of honour, Gowron. I ask you, restore my family name. Worf,... ..you killed Duras. I consider that no small favour. But what you ask is impossible. After your installation... The grasp of Duras reaches out from the grave. Much of the Council is still loyal to his family. I must have the Council's support... ..to survive. I cannot expose their treachery. You chose to accept this disgrace for the good of the Empire. Now you must live with your decision. Like a Klingon. Guinan? It's a little quiet down at ten-forward, so I thought I'd get off a little target practice. May I join you? You? Practise? I like to keep my eye sharp. I practise at level 14. Guess I could come down to that level for a while. Begin program. I bet the Captain I'd make you laugh before you became Lieutenant-Commander. Not a good bet today. I've seen you laugh. I like it. Klingons do not laugh. Yes, they do. Absolutely. You don't. But I've heard Klingon belly laughs that would curl your hair. Your son laughs. He's Klingon. He is a child and part-human. That's right. And you're not, you're full Klingon, except... you don't laugh. Because I do not feel like laughing. Other Klingons feel like laughing. What does that say about you? Perhaps it says that I do not feel like other Klingons! Program complete. Good game. Don't feel bad, I was doing this long before you were born. So, how is he? Your son. He is having difficulty adjusting to life on Earth. I could see where it might be hard for the little guy. Living with humans, being Klingon. Could be very confusing. It will not be easy for him. No, but at some point he'll wanna know what it's like to really be a Klingon. Just as you're learning now. Come. Captain, I request a leave of absence. Mr. Worf, request granted. Thank you, sir. Lieutenant. And good luck. Lieutenant Worf, personal log, star date 44996. 1. I have located the Klingon ship which my brother Kurn captains and have arranged to meet him. It has been too long, my brother. Too long. We have much to discuss. I have asked Gowron to restore our family honour. He has refused. Gowron won't live to see the day he leads the Council. What do you mean? He stands alone, surrounded by his enemies. Lursa and B'Etor would have him killed. And if they don't, I will. You will? Gowron is weak. The family of Duras must never be allowed to rule the Council. Our leaders have failed us. They no longer deserve our loyalty. It is time to sweep away the old Council and put a new one in its place. How can this be done? I already have the support of four squadron commanders in key strategic sectors. When the time comes, they will follow me. Join us, Worf, and we will usher in a new era and regain our family name. No. What?! Gowron has completed the Rite of Succession. It is our duty to support him. Gowron spits in your face when you ask him to give back what is ours and you support him! We cannot regain honour by acting dishonourably. I will not support Gowron. I am the elder brother, Kurn. I speak for our family. We will back Gowron. But not now. Not yet. We will wait until he feels the grasp of his enemies round his throat. Then we will offer him our support. And the price will be the restoration of our family name. It will be difficult to convince my allies to back Gowron. But I will try. I must go to the Mempa sector to meet with the other squadron commanders. Contact me when you have gained their support. Then I will be ready for Gowron. Captain's log, star date 44996. 8. My role as Arbiter of Succession has again brought me to the Great Hall of the Klingon High Council. Have you reached a decision regarding the succession of power? Gowron, son of M'Rel Hobkim. The Arbiter confirms that you have completed the Rite of Succession. Your enemies have been destroyed. You stand alone. Do you wish to claim leadership of the Council? I wish it. Are there no other challengers? There is one. I will challenge him. An arrogant child? Who are you? I am Toral,... son of Duras. Duras had no son. But he did, Gowron. So, this is your doing, Lursa. We wish to address the Council. Lursa, B'Etor, come forward. Members of the High Council, it is a day of great rejoicing for the family of Duras and the Empire. It seems our brother did have a son and heir. Outrageous! Duras had no mate. Where did you find him, Lursa? In a harlot's bedchamber? I will personally cut your tongue out! Impudent wretch... A simple genetic scan will prove his bloodline is valid. An illegitimate son cannot rule the High Council. The Arbiter will consider his validity. Our allies on the Council backed Toral's claim. It's in Picard's hands now. Excellent. Everything is proceeding as scheduled. Why not just kill Picard? Fool! Do we want the Federation as our enemy? No. At least not yet. But when the time is right, we will deal with the Federation. And Captain Picard. I have met with the other squadron commanders here. Three will join us, one will not. That gives us enough strength to control seven key sectors. Do you know our enemy's strength? They have at least seven squadrons. But most of the fleet has not decided which banner to follow. Gowron is nearly out of options. Soon he will have no choice. I will return soon to the homeworld. We shall meet then. Do you require the original logs recorded during the attack? Everything we have on the Khitomer massacre. Our analysis of communications between the Khitomer outpost and the Romulan ships is not as complete as that of Star base 24... Mr. Worf, you cancelled your leave? No, sir. Lieutenant, would you join me in my ready room? Mr. Worf, you're using our files on the Khitomer massacre as evidence against Duras' father? Yes, sir. Do you not see an inherent conflict of interest? Sir, those Federation records will help me prove my father was falsely accused of treason! You were using your position as a Starfleet officer to effect political change on your planet. There could not be a worse compromise of our principles. Do not tie my hands now. I must be able to prove my father's innocence. Those Federation records can do that. Mr. Worf,... ..here I am lecturing you on a conflict of interest while I'm desperately trying to avoid one of my own. You think I wish to allow the Duras family to solidify their hold on the Council? Do you think I cannot see for myself the implications for the Federation? Duras tried to have me killed. All of my instincts, my training, my very being as a Starfleet officer, are at odds with my responsibility as Arbiter of the Klingon High Council. We walk the same tightrope between two worlds, you and l. We must try our very best to keep those two worlds separate. Or we shall certainly fall. Yes, sir. I will make the Khitomer-massacre files available to anyone who wants them. To the High Council, to the Duras family, to you. Anyone. Thank you, sir. Mr. Worf,... ..this is as far as I will go. Riker to Picard. Yes, Number One. An incoming message for you from the surface, coded personal. Send it through. Captain. Welcome. Please come in. Be seated. Something to drink, Captain? Tea. Earl Grey, perhaps? Thank you. You come alone. And unarmed. Nothing will be served by killing the Arbiter before his decision. Nevertheless, a brave act, Captain. B'Etor... Your invitation was unexpected. We should have extended it sooner. We don't want you to judge us by your experience with our brother. Duras was a fool. He deserved to die. Forget him. We have. We do not wish to be your enemy. Quite the opposite. That pleases me. Have you... have you made your decision regarding Toral's challenge? I'm pursuing it with due vigilance. Allow me to heat up your tea. Toral has the bloodline to lead the Empire into the next century. He has the support of the people. Then it remains to see if he has the support of law. But he must. Surely you see that? I'll tell you what I see. If I find Toral's challenge valid, the two of you will quickly gain control of the Council and Gowron will be found dead shortly thereafter. If I reject Toral's claim, you will accuse me of serving Federation interests. It will serve as a rallying cry to declare war and overthrow Gowron. You see very clearly, Captain. But one thing is missing. If you rule against us and we are the victors in a war against Gowron,... Which we would be. ..it will mean the end of the alliance with the Federation. We would hate to see that happen as much as you. This is not a threat, Captain, just an unfortunate truth. So, why be our enemy when you can be our friend? You have manipulated the circumstances with the skill of a Romulan. My decision will be announced at high sun tomorrow. Excellent tea. Good day, ladies. What is your decision? K'Tal, this Council knows the law of heredity well. ""A son shall share in the honours or crimes of his father."" Toral is Duras' son, it has been proven by genetic scan. But with due respect to the laws of this High Council, there is no basis for accepting a petition for leadership from a boy who has fought no battles, shed no blood for his people, nor earned honour for himself. One day, perhaps he shall. But not now. Duras is dead. His claim to the leadership died with him. Gowron shall lead the Council. The Arbiter has ruled. There are no more challenges. Does the Federation dictate Klingon destiny? Or do we? Follow me and I will show you honour. Follow him... ..and you reject all Klingon law! Can you not see what you are doing? Are you blind to what they represent? Then go. Your blood will paint the way to the future. Your message said it was urgent. What do you want? Your forces are weak, Gowron. You need help to fight the family of Duras. From one dishonoured Klingon? I offer you four Klingon squadrons. Why would they follow you, a Starfleet officer? They are pledged to support my brother Kurn. Kurn is your brother? Yes. His true bloodlines were hidden to protect him. Kurn will follow me? He has opposed me in the past. I am the elder brother. He will do as I say. What is it you want in return? You know my price. The return of your honour for the support of four squadrons. No! That will not be enough. The Duras family controls most of the fleet. We must have Federation help. They will not intervene. Perhaps not yet. But Starfleet Command will listen to Picard and Picard... listens to you. I can ask nothing more of him in this matter. What? My duty as a Starfleet officer... You come to me and demand the restoration of your family honour and now... you hide behind human excuses. What are you, Worf? Do you tremble and quake with fear at the approach of combat, hoping to talk your way out of a fight, like a human? Or do you hear the cry of the warrior calling you to battle, calling you to glory, like a Klingon? The shield's down. Warp coil's damaged. Red alert. A second ship has joined the attack. It's begun. Send an emergency signal to any loyal ships! Impulse engines not responding! Engage emergency override. Override engaged. Disruptors still not responding. The Bortas has lost her port shield, sir. It is unlikely they will withstand another hit. Their primary life support has failed, sir. The Bortas has put out a general distress call. Ensign Riol, plot a course to take us safely away from the combat area. Half-impulse. Captain, it's Gowron's ship. As legitimate leader, shouldn't we help him? If we help the Bortas, we drag the Federation into a Klingon civil war. What about Worf? Ensign, engage. Port shields are still down. Disruptors on line. Lock on target. No. Don't you see? Their sensors will detect a weapons lock. If they think we're helpless, they will try to board the ship. I can fire disruptors manually when they drop their shields. 35,000 kellicams. 20,000 kellicams. Now within transporter range. They're dropping their shields. Firing on second target. They were able to raise the shields in time. Minor damage only. Disruptors off line. All power to shields. Shields failing! Incoming message. On viewer. This is Captain Kurn of the Hegh'ta. We come to defend the Empire and to follow the banner of Gowron. You have done well, Captain Kurn. Lursa and B'Etor moved more quickly than I anticipated. We shall not underestimate them again. Meet us at the Great Hall. Advise the Enterprise that their delegation is welcome to attend... ..my installation as leader. Captain's log, Star date 44998.3. With new-found support, Gowron has chosen to proceed with the installation ceremony. The Enterprise has returned so that I may perform my final duty as Arbiter of Succession. Receive now the loyalty of the Council and of the Empire. You both fought as warriors. You have proven your hearts are Klingon. I return your family honour. I give you back that which was wrongfully taken from you. Let your name be spoken once again. You are Worf, son of Mogh. The Duras family is gathering a large force near Beta Thoridar. As per the terms of the treaty of alliance, I now formally request your assistance in fighting these enemies of the Empire. These enemies are Klingon. By right and tradition, I am the sole leader. All who oppose me... are traitors. I understand, but you're aware that the Federation cannot interfere in what is, by definition, an internal Klingon affair. You arbitrated the succession. You are already involved. Those duties are finished. Captain, we must intervene. The Duras family is corrupt, power-hungry, with no loyalty. They represent a grave threat to the security of the Federation. Captain,... ..you and I know that they have conspired with Romulans in the past. If they should be victors in this war, they would surely form a new Klingon-Romulan alliance. That would represent a fundamental shift of power in this quadrant. Starfleet must support Gowron. It is in the interest of both the Federation and the Empire. I beg you, support us in our cause. Mr. Worf, I don't have to lecture you on the principle of non-interference. All Starfleet officers swear an oath to uphold it, whatever our personal feelings. I'm sorry. I must refuse. Mr. Worf? I'm afraid I must recall you to duty. We are leaving this sector now. Captain, I respectfully request that I be allowed to take an extended leave of absence. Your duties as a Starfleet officer are incompatible with remaining on a Klingon ship at a time of war. Captain... You are to return to duty at once. Then I resign my commission as a Starfleet officer. I will await you aboard the Bortas. Enter. Am I intruding? No, sir. I understand you'll serve on board the Bortas. As weapons officer. Your tactical knowledge and experience will serve them well. Thank you, sir. Mr. Worf, are you certain that this is the right decision? I was rescued from Khitomer by humans, raised and loved by human parents. I've spent most of my life around humans, fought beside them. But I was born a Klingon. My heart is of that world. I... do hear the cry of the warrior. I belong with my people. Being the only Klingon ever to serve in Starfleet gave you a singular distinction, but... ..l felt that what was unique about you was your humanity,... ..compassion, generosity, fairness. You took the best qualities of humanity and made them part of you. The result was a man whom I was proud to call one of my officers. I'll have your belongings transported to the Bortas. Thank you, sir. Attention on deck. Permission to leave the ship, sir? Permission granted. Goodbye. Dismissed. Picard has rejected Gowron's plea for help. The Enterprise has left orbit. Coward! He didn't have the courage to face us! The Federation... Celebrate later, Toral. We should not discount Jean-Luc Picard yet. He is human. And humans have a way of showing up when you least expect them. "
S5E01,"Last time on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". We have to move quickly to be successful. Successful? Yes. In preventing a Klingon civil war. I would speak with you. I do not hear the words of traitors. It was Duras's father who betrayed our people to the Romulans at Khitomer, not mine. We have discovered that our brother did indeed have a son and heir. Follow me, and I will show you honour. Your blood will paint the way to the future. If we aid the Bortas, we'll drag the Federation into a civil war. You both fought as warriors. I return your family honour. Mr. Worf, your responsibilities as an officer are incompatible with remaining on a Klingon ship during war. Then I resign my commission... ..as a Starfleet officer. Picard has rejected Gowron's plea for help. The Enterprise has left orbit. We should not discount Jean-Luc Picard yet. He is human. Humans have a way of showing up when you least expect them. And now, the conclusion. Maintain course. Status of warp engines? Warp engines at 50 percent. Status of shields? Aft shields buckling. Transfer auxiliary power to shields! Aft shields are gone. We cannot win. We must withdraw. Keep your place. New course! 307, mark 275. But that is dangerously close to... We are entering the star's corona. We will reach the photosphere in 30 seconds. Stand by to interwarp on my command. Set course 250, mark 01 5. Shields failing! Hull temperature exceeding design limit. Captain! Maintain course. They are closing on us. Stand by. Captain's log, star date 45020.4. We have arrived at Star base 234. I've taken the opportunity to make a proposal to Admiral Shanthi. There have been three engagements in two weeks, all won by ships loyal to the Duras family. None of which is our concern, Jean-Luc. The Klingon civil war is, by definition, an internal matter of the Empire. Agreed. But if the Duras are aided by the Romulans, it is our concern. The Romulans have been attempting to destroy our Alliance for 20 years. At the same time, the Duras have been conspiring with the Romulans. Doesn't it seem odd that the Duras can field such a force against Gowron that they outmatch him at every turn? Some would call it good leadership. And some would say they must be getting help. The Romulans take enormous risks for an advantage over the Federation. Can we seriously believe that now, with the future of the Empire in the balance, they are content to stand by and watch? What is it you propose, Captain? We must stop the flow of supplies and equipment to the Duras from the Romulans. What I propose is that we send a fleet to the Romulan-Klingon border. We'll take no offensive action. But we can expose Romulan supplies that attempt to cross the border. A blockade? Exactly. But how would you overcome the Romulan cloaking device? My chief engineer has developed a system that should nullify that advantage. Each ship will send out an active tachyon beam to the other blockading ships. In theory, any cloaked vessel that attempts to pass between our ships must cross that beam and be detected. I'll have to clear this with the Federation Council. In the meantime, assemble your fleet, Captain. Nicely done. I hope we know what we're doing. So do l, Number One. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, star date 45021.3. Convincing Starfleet Command to establish a blockade was painless. Implementing that plan is proving more troublesome. Starfleet is stretched thin in this quadrant. There are 12 ships within a day's travel. The only other ships are in for repair or under construction. Most don't have full crews yet. We could scare up seven, eight ships. Mr. La Forge, can you implement your grid with 20 ships? It's possible, but the more ships, the bigger the net. Alright. I want to add the Tian An Men, the Sutherland and the Hermes, whether they're ready or not. Mr. Data, select Enterprise-experienced officers to augment the ships' crews. Aye, sir. Will, I want you to command the Excalibur. Her crew has been reassigned. Geordi, you will be first officer. Aye, sir. I want the fleet under way by 0900. Thank you, gentlemen. Yes, Mr. Data? May I ask a question of a personal nature? Yes. I am confused. Why have I not been assigned a command? I felt that you would be needed here. Why do you ask? You commented on the lack of senior officers available. I believe my 26 years of service qualifies me. However, if you do not feel the time has arrived for an android to command a starship, perhaps... Commander. I believe the Starship Sutherland will need a captain. I can think of no one better suited than you. Thank you, sir. You always did have fools working for you, Larg. Now you don't have as many. You were lucky, Kurn. But luck runs out. Someday I'll stand over your corpse and drink to the victory of the Duras! Worf. Worf, good. This piece of baktag is Capt Larg. He commanded the squadron that tried to destroy us yesterday. The infamous Worf, son of Mogh. What is that you are wearing? The uniform of a Klingon! The Capital City is neutral ground and Larg's men are all around us. As are mine. Good to drink with you, Kurn. May you die well. Die well, Larg. You drink with our enemies? How many are Gowron's men? How many are Duras? Does it matter? When we meet in battle, we will fight to the death. But here, here we're all warriors, all Klingons. Repairs to the Hegh'ta are proceeding. The stabilizers... Is there nothing in your heart but duty? It is my responsibility. We all have responsibilities and duties. But you and I are warriors fighting in a great war. Think of it. You and I will fight battles that others only dream of. The time for glory is here. It is not a time to worry about stabilizers. It is a time to celebrate. For tomorrow, we all may die! Let us, the sons of Mogh, live this night as if it were our last. Worf is not like his brother. No. He tries to be. But he's still unsure of himself. He needs something to help restore his confidence. I think he'll find our offer appealing. I'll make sure he does. Keep this mixture above 90 percent or we'll never leave orbit. Thank you, Mr. Krags. I am Lt Cmdr Data. Lt Cmdr Christopher Hobson. By order of Starfleet, I hereby take command. Please note the time and date in the log. Excuse me, sir. I'd like to request a transfer. May I ask why? I don't believe I'd be a good first officer for you. Your service record suggests you would be. No, that's not what I mean. I don't think I'd be good for you. Why? Frankly, I don't believe in your ability to command this ship. You're a fellow officer. I respect that. But no one would say that a Klingon would be a good counsellor, or that a Berellian could be an engineer. They're not suited. By the same token, an android isn't a good choice to be captain. I understand your concerns. Request denied. The Endeavour has cleared the dock. All ships standing by. Good. Course 118, mark 357. Full impulse power. Signal the fleet. We'll enter warp once we're clear of the system. Engage. The Romulan convoy is late. We need those supplies. Gowron has suffered another loss in the Mempa system. His forces will not threaten you for some time. But if... The convoy will arrive soon. The Federation fleet has left Star base 234, heading for Klingon territory. How many? At least 20 starships. Who is commanding this fleet? Picard! What does it mean? Is the Federation entering the war? Should we attack first? Silence the child or send him away. Movar. Return to Romulus immediately. Have all available ships at these coordinates in two days. Yes, Commander. 20 starships aren't enough to wage war. Starfleet must be bluffing. Perhaps. Our forces in the Mempa sector are in full retreat. They will need to regroup near Beta Lankal. We destroyed their supply bases in that sector three weeks ago. How can they continue to fight? They must be getting help. Maybe they have better leaders. I say you have failed as our leader, Gowron. There is no time for this. We must make plans before they reach Beta Lankal. How can we oppose the Duras if we fight each other? Gowron must answer this challenge. Stop! Do we fall upon ourselves like Ferengi? The enemy is the Duras. We are at war! Now the war... can continue. We're entering Klingon territory. Signal the fleet to maintain yellow alert. Aye, sir. Begin scans of the Romulan border. No uncloaked ships in sensor range. A few subspace anomalies. Those anomalies could be cloaked ships. Could be, sir. Open a channel to the Excalibur. Excalibur. Riker here. Deploy the fleet, Will. It's time to spread our net. Yes, sir. We've arrived at the designated coordinates. All stop. Notify the flagship that we have assumed station. Starboard power coupling is overloaded. We've got a radiation leak on decks ten through 12. The backups are not functioning. There wasn't enough time to test them. Terry, I want you in Engineering working on a new coupling. You have taken the phaser and torpedo units off line. Keith, you and l... Mr. Hobson. It is inappropriate for you not to consult your commanding officer. I was trying to safeguard the people on those decks. But you're right. Belay those orders, everyone. Phasers and torpedoes are back on line. What should we do, sir? You will take the phaser and torpedo units off line and begin repairs. Thank you, sir. You heard the Captain, everyone. We're ready, sir. How long will it take the Romulans to detect the tachyon field? Not long. Romulan sensors are as good as ours. Very well. Energize the network. Commander, there's an increase in tachyon emissions from the Federation fleet. They're using the beams as a detection field. If we try to cross it, they'll see us, even cloaked. Issue orders to begin work on penetrating this field. In the meantime, we have to convince Picard he should leave. Captain, I'm picking up something directly ahead. Romulan ship de-cloaking. Shall I raise shields? Not yet. They're hailing us, sir. On screen. Tasha? No, Captain. My name is Cmdr Sela. The woman you knew as Tasha Yar was my mother. Deploying an invasion fleet along our border is an act of aggression. It will not be tolerated. You have 20 hours to recall your ships and return peacefully. So you believe her? I'm not saying we should accept her claim at face value. But I sensed no deception. She believes she's the daughter of Tasha Yar. No matter what she believes, Sela can't be her daughter. Tasha's records give no indication that she was ever pregnant. Tasha was a child when this woman was born. Sela could have been cloned. Or been surgically altered. Why? What advantage could there be to the Romulans? As this now stands, it won't have any impact on our strategy. We'll continue the blockade, leave the next move to them. Am I intruding? No, not at all. Is something wrong? News travels fast. I heard that Tasha Yar's daughter is aboard the Romulan ship. I think the Romulans are just hoping to create a distraction. They want to keep us off balance. How much do you know about the last ship called Enterprise? Enterprise-C? She was lost in the battle of Narendra III, defending a Klingon outpost from the Romulans. And the survivors? There were stories of prisoners taken back to Romulus. But these were rumours. No. There were survivors. And Tasha Yar was one of them. Guinan, that was 23 years ago. Tasha Yar was only a child. I know that. I also know she was aboard that ship. And she was not a child. And I think you sent her there. How can that be? I don't know. I just know that you did. Tasha died. A year before you came on the Enterprise. You never met her. I know that. If you have only a vague intuition... You can't just dismiss this. If I'm right, then you are responsible for this whole situation. I think it's time that I met Cmdr Sela. We are at war. Gowron should forbid challenges until we are victorious. A Klingon does not postpone a matter of honour. A Klingon should place the Empire above his own pride. Now Gowron no longer suits you? Perhaps you wish to challenge him for leadership? No! Then do not speak of this! I did not wish to follow Gowron. You came to me and insisted that we support Gowron against the Duras family. The time for debate is over. We are Klingons. He is our leader. If that is not enough for you, perhaps you made the wrong choice when you put on that uniform. Well, Captain, what is this urgent matter we need to discuss? Won't you sit down? I'm afraid you have misinterpreted our presence here. I assure you that we have no hostile intention. So then I can tell my superiors that a fleet of 23 Federation starships is on our border for what? Humanitarian reasons? It is our intent to prevent any external power interfering in Klingon affairs. Nor do we have any plan to do so. But, if for any reason, we chose to enter Klingon territory, how would you stop us? With our cloaking devices, we can slip by you. Then why don't you just take your ships across? You sound eager for us to try. Perhaps you've discovered a method in detecting our ships? However, I don't think you want to discuss our military situation. Alright. Why did I invite you? You want the answer to the only question on your mind. How could Tasha be my mother? It's been suggested that she was on the Enterprise-C 24 years ago, that she was one of the survivors, and you're a product of a union between her and a Romulan. But you know that's impossible. She was a child when that battle occurred. But you claim it is possible, that you're the daughter of Tasha Yar. Yes, she was on that ship 24 years ago. She was sent there, by you, from the future. She was among those few who survived. They were to be executed after interrogation. But a Romulan general saw her and became enamoured with her. So a deal was struck. Their lives would be spared if she became his consort. I was born a year later. I want to meet your mother. Can you arrange that? One night, when I was four, she came to me. She bundled me up and she told me to stay quiet. I realized she was taking me away, from my home, my father. So I cried out. My father offered her life. He gave her a home, a child. And how did she repay him? By betrayal. They executed her. Everything in me that was human died that day. All that's left now is Romulan. Never doubt that. Doubts? I'm full of them. But nothing can persuade me that what you have told me is true. And I do know one thing. It will not affect my judgement at our next encounter. You have 14 hours, Captain. I suggest you use them wisely. Is something wrong? Welcome, Worf, son of Mogh. What do you want? The same as you. Personal honour. Glory for the Empire. Your family has never valued honour. You only knew our brother. We are not like him. Our brother made many mistakes. One was to make you an enemy. We would rather be your friend. Then you should not oppose Gowron. Gowron is nothing! Toral is Duras's only son. And he will be the leader of the Council. In your heart, even you know that. But Toral needs guidance. A firm hand. A father figure. That could be you, if you were mated to B'Etor. The rewards could be greater than you can imagine. Nothing will stand in our way. We could rule the Empire together. Join us. Usher in a new era for our people. An era where honour has no meaning? Where Klingons trade loyalties in dark rooms? And the Empire is ruled from Romulus? Enough, Lursa. You failed. I need to know the strength of the Federation fleet. I don't have time for this. Turn him over to the guard. B'Etor can have him when they're finished. Come! In 13 hours, we'll be forced to withdraw or fight the Romulans. Neither alternative is acceptable. We must expose their involvement before the deadline. What is it you propose? If you launch an attack now, then the Duras fleet will call for supplies. Lursa and B'Etor will call for help. The Romulans will try to run the blockade. We'll be ready. Once the Romulan connection has been exposed,... ..support will fall away from Lursa and B'Etor. Very well. I will make preparations. One thing more, Picard. Worf has been captured by the Duras. I hope he dies well. Qapla'! When Gowron attacks, we will make our move. Excalibur will fall back with engine problems. You take the Akagi and the Hornet here to open a gap in our detection net. If the Romulans know of the field, they'll run the blockade. Exactly. But when they do, the Enterprise and the Tian An Men will swing around, close the gap and catch them in the act. Very nice. I'd better get back. Good luck, Will. Good luck, Captain. We've received a message from Lursa and B'Etor. Gowron's forces attacked in three sectors. The Duras are nearing defeat. You mean they were caught unprepared and they're crying for help. Have the science sections found a way to circumvent the grid? We think so. Just before we cross, we send out a massive tachyon pulse. A burst that large should disable a part of their network. Good. One of their ships is moving off the blockade. Their warp drive is failing. Picard is redeploying the fleet to compensate for the missing ship. There's a gap in the net. He doesn't have enough ships. If we act quickly, we can move through. Commander! No. I don't think so. It's what we've waited for. I know. And so does Picard. He's giving us what we need. He expects us to take it. No. We won't step into Picard's trap. We will disable part of his network here, where they're weakest. We'll direct the energy burst at the ship with the android captain. Sir, the net is picking up activity from the Romulans. 15 cloaked ships spreading out along the border. Signal the fleet to stand by. Aye, sir. Now! Come to course 080, mark 295. There's a disruption in the tachyon detectors. It's localized to this segment of the net. Open a channel to the Sutherland. Data here, sir. We're reading a disruption of the net in your area. The Romulans released a high-energy burst. The net is no longer effective in radius of 10 million kilometers. That's where they're going through. Send a signal. All ships to Gamma Eridon. We'll re-establish the net there. Aye, sir. All Federation ships proceed at maximum warp to Gamma Eridon. Acknowledge the signal. Ensign, engage at warp 9.3. Aye, sir. What are you doing? In disrupting the net, the Romulans may have caused a tachyon signature around their own ships. But we have no way of detecting it. All stop. Aye, sir. All stop. Sir! The fleet's been ordered to Gamma Eridon. The tachyon signatures will not last long. By the time we deploy, it will be too late. Reconfigure the sensors to detect ionized particles. The area's been flooded with tachyon particles! We'll never find what we're looking for. I am aware of the difficulties. Bring the phasers on line. That will flood three decks with radiation! We will initiate radiation protocol. You don't give a damn about people's lives! We're not machines! Mr. Hobson! You will carry out my orders or I will relieve you. Yes, sir. The Sutherland isn't heading for the rendezvous point. She's come to a full stop. Open a channel. The Enterprise wants to know the reason we've stopped. Display sensor schematic. Display sensor sweep, maximum range. Are you going to answer the Enterprise? Open a display with tachyon emissions. Highlight any tachyon signatures which show inertial displacement. Concentrate a sensor sweep in that area. This is pointless. Those readings could be anything. There's no way to be sure the Romulans are there. Reconfigure photon torpedo warhead yields. Set for high-energy burst level six. Level six? But that won't even... Do it! Torpedoes ready. Another message coming in. It's Capt Picard. Mr. Data, you were ordered to rendezvous at Gamma Eridon. Acknowledge. Stand by, Captain. Mr. Hobson, prepare to fire. Didn't you hear Capt Picard? Fire. Fire! They have discovered us. Reverse course. Order the fleet back to Romulan territory. The Duras need this convoy! Without supplies, they cannot win. We've been discovered. It's over. What should I tell Lursa and B'Etor? Tell them... they're on their own. They're changing course, heading back to Romulan space. Make a report to the flagship. Take the phasers off line and begin a radiation clean-up. Yes, sir. Captain. Defeat! How? Where are the Romulans? They never came! Kill him! No! Toral, the next leader of the Empire. Gowron is looking forward to seeing you again. Captain's personal log, star date 45025.4. With profound relief, I have ordered the fleet back to Federation territory following the Romulan withdrawal and the news of Gowron's victory. We have arrived at the Klingon Homeworld, where I will present the High Council a full report on our encounter. Come. Captain, I wish to submit myself for disciplinary action. I disobeyed an order from a superior officer. Although the result of my actions proved positive, the ends cannot justify the means. No, they can't. However, the claim, ""I was only following orders,"" has been used to justify too many tragedies in our history. Starfleet doesn't want officers who blindly follow orders without analyzing the situation. Your actions were appropriate for the circumstances. I have noted that in your record. Mr. Data. Nicely done. Sir. The Council appreciates your report, Captain. The information on the Romulan supply ships will prove very useful. Before you leave... ..there is one last matter to attend to. Bring him. Toral, son of Duras. You stand convicted of treason. The Duras family will one day rule the Empire! Perhaps. But not today. Worf. This child's family wrongly took your name... ..and your honour from you. In return,... ..l give his life to you. What's wrong? Kill him! No. But it's our way. It's the Klingon way. I know. But it is not my way. This boy has done me no harm. I will not kill him for the crimes of his family. It falls to Kurn. No. No, you gave me his life. I have spared it. As you wish. Request permission to return to duty, sir. Granted. "
S5E02,"Captain's log, star date 45047.2. We are en route to the uninhabited El-Adrel system, near the territory of an enigmatic race, the Children of Tama. The Tamarians arrived at El-Adrel IV nearly three weeks ago. They have been sending a signal towards Federation space ever since. The signal is a mathematical progression with no specific message. But they wanted us to notice them. Apparently. Starfleet thinks they are attempting communication. Commander? Our vessels have met Tamarian ships seven times over the past 100 years. Each meeting went without incident. But relations were not set up. Communication was not possible. Why? The Children of Tama were called incomprehensible by Capt Silvestri. Others accounts are alike. A cause for concern. They may be threatening our border. Previous accounts suggest a peaceable race. We have to start from there. Agreed. I appreciate your prudence, but Starfleet believes the Tamarians have extended a hand. We must do the same. The Children of Tama. I've heard rumours about them for years. Indeed. But are they truly incomprehensible? In my experience, communication is a matter of patience, imagination. I would like to believe we have these qualities in sufficient measure. Rai and Jiri at Lungha. Rai of Lowani. Lowani under two moons. Jiri of Ubaya. Ubaya of crossed roads at Lungha. Lungha, her sky grey. Rai and Jiri at Lungha. Counsellor? I sense nothing but good intentions from them. Mr. Data? He seems to be stating the proper names of individuals and locations. Yes, but what does it all mean? I am at a loss, sir. Captain, would you be prepared to consider the creation of a non-aggression pact between our two peoples, possibly leading to a trade agreement and cultural interchange? Does this sound like a reasonable course of action? Kadir beneath Mo Moteh! The river Temarc! In winter. Impressions? They're trying their best. As are we. For what it's worth. Shaka. When the walls fell. Darmok. Darmok? Rai and Jiri at Lungha! Shaka. When the walls fell. Zima at Anzo! Zima and Bakor! Darmok at Tanagra! Shaka! Mirab, his sails unfurled! Darmok. Mirab. Temarc! The river Temarc. Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra. Block their transport on the shield. Not enough time. Where is he? They have transported Picard to the planet with their captain. Riker to O'Brien! Not possible to transport, sir. Their ship has created a particle scattering field in the ionosphere. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Riker to Capt Picard. Do you read me, Captain? Can we compensate? No, sir. They are projecting a particle- sustaining beam into the atmosphere. The result is a hyper-ionization, disrupting EM and subspace carriers. So they can't communicate with their man either or beam anyone through. Correct. However, they have left sensor frequencies clear. Then they can tell what's going on. Analysis, Mr. Worf. What the hell is going on? A contest, perhaps. Between champions. Our captain against theirs. Theirs was armed. Darmok and Jalad. You want to fight with me? Is that it? A challenge? Darmok and Jalad. I don't know who or what Darmok or Jalad are, but I didn't come here to start a war. Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra! Sorry, Captain. Shaka. When the walls fell. Sensors show that the two captains are in apparent good health, about 20 meters from each other. Hail the Tamarian ship. On screen. You have our captain. I want him released. Darmok at Tanagra. This could be interpreted as an act of war. Kiteo. His eyes closed. Chenza at court. The court of silence. Chenza! Any way to get through to them? Not without further study. Close the channel, Mr. Worf. Gladly, sir. Worf, I want you to assemble a team, take a shuttle down to the planet, bring back the Captain. Aye, Commander. The Tamarians are able to stop a shuttle. I'm aware of that. But disrupting our transporter beam and firing on a shuttle are different things. I'm betting they won't push it that far. Shaka. When the walls fell. Shaka indeed. What now, Captain? Will you attack me in my sleep? If I don't freeze to death first. Darmok of Kanza. Jalad of the Kituay. Picard of the Federation. Of the Starship Enterprise. Of the planet Earth! Kadir beneath Mo Moteh. Temba. Temba? What does that mean? Fire? Does Temba mean fire? Temba. His arms wide. Temba is a person? His arms wide. Because he's... He's holding them apart in... In generosity. In giving. In taking? Temba. His arms wide. Thank you. Thank you! First Officer's log, supplemental. I'm sending a shuttlecraft to find Capt Picard, gambling that the Tamarians will sit tight and not risk exchange of fire. The positron density is 0.013. Electron concentration 7.95. Particle gradient, four over seven. We are 250 kilometers from the planet's surface. The shuttle has reached the E region of the planet's ionosphere. How long can we maintain communication? The Tamarian scattering layer is in the upper D region. The shuttle will reach that area in two minutes. The Tamarian ship? Unchanged, sir. They appear to be making no attempt to stop us. Maybe we called their bluff. Status? Navigational, life support, propulsion normal. On-board systems do not appear to be disrupted, but I can barely read you. Maintain communication as long as conditions permit. I am reading a power surge in the Tamarian plasma reactor. Lt Worf, evasive manoeuvre sequence delta. Sequence delta. The shuttle has been hit. Damage? The starboard nacelle has been rendered inoperable. That's all? Riker to Worf. Report. Starboard thrusters destroyed. I may be able to land, but I will not be able to take off. Understood. Return to the Enterprise, Mr. Worf. Aye, sir. Enough to turn them back, but not hurt them. Yes, sir. The phaser pulse was attenuated for just that effect. Nice shooting. I can punch up the beam enough to get the Captain through the field, but it'll take me at least a full day. Capt Picard could be dead by then. I do not believe so. I have confidence in his ability as a warrior. He will be victorious. You still assume this is a challenge. We can't be certain of that. Agreed. We're only making guesses about their motivations, no more. Then why wait? lf we attack them, they cannot maintain their scattering field. Which might start a shooting match and still not save the Captain. It would end this stalemate. It's too much of a risk! I'll take that course when it's the last one left. Who the hell are these people? There has to be a way to get through. With more study it may be possible. Then do it. Deanna, help him. I want something by 0900 hours. Now, where have you gone to, my friend? Forgive the intrusion, Captain, but I need some answers. Darmok at Tanagra! Shaka! Mirab, his sails unfurled! Darmok! Mirab! Freeze. Darmok. Darmok. Well, it seems to be a point of contention between them. Something the Tamarian Captain proposed that the First Officer didn't like. The apparent emotional dynamic supports that. As with the other terms used by the Tamarian, this appears to be a proper noun. The name clearly carries a meaning. Computer, search for the term ""Darmok"" in all linguistic databases. Searching. Darmok is the name of a seventh-dynasty emperor on Kanda IV. A mytho-historical hunter on Shantil III. A colony on Malindi VII. A frozen dessert on Tazna V. A... Stop search. How many entries are there for Darmok? 47. All our technology and experience, our universal translator, our years in space, contact with more alien cultures than I remember... I have encountered 1,754 non-human races during my tenure in Starfleet. And we still can't even say hello to these people. Correct. A single word can lead to tragedy. One word misspoken or misunderstood. And that could happen here if we fail. Replay at time index 144. Darmok at Tanagra! Freeze. Computer, search for the term ""Tanagra"", all databases. Searching. Tanagra. The ruling family on Gallos II. A ceremonial drink on Lerishi IV. An island continent on Shantil Ill. Stop. Shantil Ill. Computer, cross-reference that with the previous search index. Darmok is a mytho-historical hunter on Shantil Ill. I think we've got something. Captain's log. Darmok! Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra! I was curious. I meant no harm. Shaka! Temba. His arms like Temba! Enough! I will not fight you! You will just have... Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra. Temba, his arms wide. I'll go along with that. Commander, sensors are picking up an electromagnetic disturbance approaching the Captain. Analysis? A variable induction field. Possibly a life form. How close is it to the Captain? The field is erratic, appearing and disappearing, but it appears to be moving toward him. Attacking? Riker to La Forge. La Forge here. How much longer on the transporter? Two hours, maybe three. I want the Captain out now! That's not very likely, sir. I don't want to hear that. Lefler, what's the resonance frequency? 0.34 over standard. I want 0.53 at the very least. Commander, I need two minutes. There's a good chance it won't work. If it fails... I know. We will have tipped our hand to the Tamarians. But it's a chance we have to take. Agreed. La Forge, proceed. We're on it. La Forge out. Riker to transporter room one. O'Brien here, Commander. Stand by, Mr. O'Brien. Mirab, his sails unfurled? Come! Shaka, when the walls fell. Shaka, when the walls fell. Shaka. You said that before, when I was trying to build a fire. Is that a failure? An inability to do something? Darmok and Jalad... ..at Tanagra. I remember the words, but I don't understand! Matrix levels? Annular convergence, 439.205. Confinement resolution, 0.527. That won't do it. Increase thermal input coefficient to 150 percent. Increasing. Status, La Forge? We're almost there, Commander. Lefler, shunt the overload to the sequencers in transporter one. Yes, sir. La Forge to O'Brien. Go ahead. Commander. Confirm phase-sequencer linkage. Link confirmed. Ready whenever you are, sir. Uzani. His army at Lashmir! At Lashmir? Was it like this at Lashmir? A similar situation to the one here? Uzani. His army with fist open. A strategy, with fist open? With fist open. His army with fist closed. With fist closed. An army with fist open. To lure the enemy. With fist closed to attack? That's how you communicate, isn't it? By citing example! By metaphor! Uzani's army with fist open! Sokath! His eyes uncovered! No! I've got a piece of him, that's all. Boost the confinement beam. 157 over standard. It's as solid as it'll go. The Tamarian and the entity are in close proximity. The Tamarian's life signs are fluctuating. The scattering field is still on. What the hell is wrong with them? They can see what's going on. Riker to O'Brien, report. The field's still deflecting the signal. There just isn't enough of him. Open a channel to the Tamarians. Aye, sir. Your captain is under attack! Drop your particle field. Kailash! When it rises. They have closed the channel. O'Brien to bridge. I can't hold him. Shaka. When the walls fell. First Officer's log, star date 45048. 8. Our attempt to transport Capt Picard back has failed. My options are narrowing, my patience all but gone. The situation is that the entity has moved off several hundred meters. Capt Picard's bio-scan readings are stable. The Tamarian's are not. He may be injured. If the entity attacks again, the Captain may face it alone. The transporter isn't usable. The Tamarians have deepened the scattering field to the D region. We can't get through. Unless we attack the ship. Can you find the source of their beam? They have a polarity-coil generator. It's pretty heavily shielded. Could we get through with our phasers? Not with the first spread. It'd take a few hits. That's not good enough. We need to knock out their field with one shot, get the Captain back before they know it. We could target the amplification pathways around the generator. We can do it in one burst. How long would it take? Worf and I would have to adjust the pre-fire chamber for focus. A few hours? Make it so. I would prefer a peaceful solution. If we could talk our way out, that much the better. Sadly, it may not be that simple. What did you find out? The Tamarian ego structure does not allow what we call self-identity. Their ability to abstract is highly unusual. They communicate through narrative imagery, a reference to people and places from their mytho-historical accounts. It's as if I were to say to you, ""Juliet on her balcony"". An image of romance. Exactly. Imagery is everything to them. It embodies their emotional states, their very thought processes. It's how they communicate and how they think. If we know how they think, can't we get across to them? No. It is like understanding the grammar of a language, but none of the vocabulary. If I didn't know who Juliet was or why she was on that balcony, the image alone wouldn't have any meaning. Correct. For instance, we know that Darmok was a great hero, a hunter, and that Tanagra was an island, but that's it. Without the details, there's no understanding. We have to learn the narrative from which Tamarians draw their imagery. Given our current relations, that does not appear likely. Darmok and Jalad... ..at Tanagra. Our situation is similar to theirs. I understand that. But I need to know more. You must tell me more about Darmok and Jalad. Tell me... You used the words, ""Temba, his arms wide"" when you gave me the knife and the fire. Could that mean ""give""? Temba, his arms wide. Darmok. Give me more about Darmok. Darmok on the ocean. Darmok. Darmok. The ocean. Darmok on the ocean. A metaphor? For being alone? Isolated? Darmok on the ocean. Are you alright? Kiazi's children, their faces wet. Temba, his arms open. Give me more about Darmok on the ocean. Tanagra on the ocean. Darmok at Tanagra. At Tanagra. A country? Tanagra on the ocean. An island! Temba, his arms wide. Jalad on the ocean. Jalad at Tanagra. Jalad at Tanagra. He went to the same island as Darmok. Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra. The beast at Tanagra. The beast? There was a creature at Tanagra? Darmok and Jalad, the beast of Tanagra. They arrive separately. They struggle together against a common foe, the beast at Tanagra. Darmok and Jalad. At Tanagra. Darmok and Jalad on the ocean. They left together. Darmok and Jalad on the ocean. The ocean. Zinda! His face black, his eyes red... Callimas. At Bahar. You hoped that something like this would happen, didn't you? You knew there was a dangerous creature here and you knew from the tale of Darmok that a danger shared might sometimes bring two people together. Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra. You and me, here. At El-Adrel. Kira at Bakshi. Temba, his arms wide. My turn? I'm not much of a storyteller. Besides, you wouldn't understand. Shaka, when the walls fell. Perhaps that doesn't matter. You want to hear it anyway. There's a story, a very ancient one, from Earth. I'll... I'll try and remember it. Gilgamesh, a king. Gilgamesh, a king. At Uruk. He tormented his subjects. He made them angry. They cried out aloud, ""Send us a companion for our king!"" ""Spare us from his madness!"" Enkidu, a wild man from the forest, entered the city. They fought in the temple. They fought in the streets. Gilgamesh defeated Enkidu. They became great friends. Gilgamesh and Enkidu at Uruk. At Uruk. The... The new friends went out into the desert together, where the great bull of heaven was killing men by the hundreds. Enkidu caught the bull by the tail. Gilgamesh struck him with his sword. Gilgamesh. They were victorious. But Enkidu fell to the ground, struck down by the gods. And Gilgamesh wept bitter tears, saying,... ...""He who was my companion... ..through adventure and hardship... ..is gone for ever."" First Officer's log, supplemental. Despite the risk of war, I have no choice but to break the stalemate. Phasers nearly ready, sir. Stand by to fire. Commander, the Tamarian's bio-scan is becoming unreadable. He may be dead, sir. If we know that, so do the Tamarians. Riker to La Forge. La Forge here. I need those phasers. Sir. Sensors show the entity is approaching Capt Picard's position. I understand your sacrifice, Captain. Unfortunately, if our friend out there has its way,... ..no one will ever know what you tried to do. Nine meters and closing. The energy output of the entity has doubled. Six meters. La Forge to bridge. You have phasers. Fire. Their particle-beam emitters are inoperative. Scattering field is down, sir. O'Brien, energize. We got him, Commander. Maximum shields. Aye, sir. Red alert! Starboard shields at 52 percent. Forward shields are gone. Let's get out of here. That may not be possible. The starboard nacelle sustained a direct hit. Warp engines are off line. Go to impulse. Back us off. They are matching our manoeuvres. And firing. Return fire, Mr. Worf. Full phasers. Firing. Their shields are holding. They are firing again. Our shields have failed. We cannot survive another hit. Hail the Tamarian vessel. Aye, Captain. Zinda! His face black, his eyes red. Temarc. The river Temarc! In winter. Darmok? And Jalad. At Tanagra. Darmok and Jalad... ..on the ocean. Sokath, his eyes open! The beast of Tanagra. Uzani, his army. Shaka, when the walls fell. Picard and Dathon at El-Adrel. Mirab, with sails unfurled. Temba, his arms open. Temba at rest. Thank you. Power has been restored, sir. New friends, Captain? I can't say, Number One. But at least they're not new enemies. I hope I'm not intruding. Of course not, Number One. The damage report's ready for your review. Thank you. Greek, sir? The Homeric Hymns, one of the root metaphors of our own culture. For the next time we encounter the Tamarians? More familiarity with our own mythology might help us to relate to theirs. The Tamarian was willing to risk all of us just for the hope of communication, connection. Now the door is open between our peoples. That commitment meant more to him than his own life. Thank you, Number One. "
S5E03,"There's a time to call a Romulan's bluff and a time when you don't. No? One does not always have the luxury. You've got to choose your time and place with them. True or false? Yes. Wherever possible. So, this time you were lucky. I suppose all's well that ends well, but if I'd been in your shoes... That really does look nice, Mr. Mot. I think that will be sufficient. Hold on. There. I must tell you, Captain, Will Riker was in for a trim and he agrees with me 100 percent. Bridge to Capt Picard. Yes. Sorry to interrupt. We're receiving a distress signal from Solarion IV. That's right along the Cardassian border. Lay in a new course. I'm on my way. I said we shouldn't colonize so close to the Cardassians. Report. The signal ended abruptly 0455. Unable to raise them on subspace. Hail them on other frequencies. I've tried. No response. Time to the Solarion system? 26 minutes, Captain. So you've been discussing alternative engagement strategy with Mr. Mot. He was discussing them with me. He's the fleet's best barber. What can you do? Receiving another signal of a vessel leaving orbit of Solarion IV. New frequency, low band. Audio only. Open a channel. This is the Bajora. We claim responsibility for the destruction of the Federation colony on Solarion IV. As long as we are without our homeland, no one will be safe in this sector. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, star date 45076.3. We have arrived at Lya Station Alpha with survivors from Solarion IV. Admiral Kennelly has rendezvoused to discuss the Bajoran terrorist attack. Sorry. Ginger tea with honey, 80 degrees Celsius. Ginger tea? My Aunt Adele's cure for the common cold. Common, hell! I picked this up from the Cardassian liaison this weekend. It's some damn virus they sicked on me. Did he have anything to say about this attack? The same old story for the Cardassians. They've had terrorist problems since they annexed the Bajoran Homeworld 40 years ago. But in 40 years, they've never attacked a Federation target. A militant splinter group has broken away from the Bajoran settlement camps. The leader's name is Orta. He'll do whatever he has to to get attention. And our response? Listen, Jean-Luc. I'm the first to say the Bajora deserve attention. Chased off their own planet by the Cardassians, forced to wander the galaxy, settling wherever they can. It's tragic. On many worlds they are isolated, treated as pariahs. The Federation is sympathetic to their cause, but they're not helping with this attack. That's what I want you to communicate to them. This could be done through diplomatic channels, Admiral. What do you really want of us? Find this terrorist leader, Orta. And get him back where he belongs any way you can. Any way I can? The Federation has dozens of settlements in that sector. We cannot allow the violence to continue. What do I offer Orta to persuade him to cooperate? Amnesty. Admiral... ! And a promise that we will address this issue with the Cardassians. Quietly, behind the scenes, using every legitimate means possible. But the Bajora must be patient. They've endured generations of sympathy and promises. How can I believe Orta will be satisfied with more of the same? It's your job to see to it that he does, Jean-Luc. Riker to Capt Picard. Go ahead. Have you approved the transfer of a new officer? Negative. Well, we've got one. Waiting to beam aboard, with orders. Ensign Ro Laren. Ro Laren? From the Wellington? The very same. Shall I tell her there's been some mistake? Stand by, Commander. I wrote the orders. I thought she might be valuable to you. Admiral, I would appreciate consulting rights on the assigning of a new officer, especially one with her record. She's Bajoran. There are others in Starfleet. Assign one of them! I've discussed this with her. I am convinced that she is the right one for this job. After what happened on Garon II, she shouldn't be on any starship. Let alone the flagship, my ship! You're taking her, Captain. It's been arranged. I can't tell you how hard it was to get her out of prison. It's that important to you? It's that important to the mission. Picard to Riker. Go ahead. Proceed with the transport. Sir? I'll... fill you in later. Yes, sir. I hope you and I don't regret this. You can handle her, Captain, if anyone can. Ensign Ro Laren reporting as ordered. You will follow Starfleet uniform code aboard this ship, Ensign. Some of the crew will not want to serve with Ensign Laren, sir. They will have to learn to live with it. I intend to demand the highest level of performance from her. I would expect nothing less. It won't be for long, Will. Come! Ensign Laren, please sit down. Ensign Ro, sir. Pardon? Bajora have the family name first, the individual's name second. I am properly addressed as Ensign Ro. I'm sorry. I didn't know. There's no reason you should. It's an old custom. Most Bajora accept the distortion of their names to assimilate. I do not. I wish to be candid, Ensign. Please. I'm aware of your Starfleet record and your problems on other ships and the incident at Garon II that led to your court martial. I'm concerned about your presence on this mission. I don't want to be here any more than you want me to be here, sir. Then why take this assignment? If I may be equally candid? It's better than prison. Better than prison? Some officers wait years to serve on this ship. Being called back into Starfleet was not my idea. Nor ours. Yet we will all be serving together. We have expectations of you. Captain,... I know the routine. You don't have to worry about me. We're stuck with each other. So let's just get this over with and go our own separate ways, OK? Dismissed. Captain's log. We're approaching the Valo system, on the edge of Cardassian territory, where many Bajorans have resettled. There are dozens of Bajoran camps on the three Class-M planets. I suggest we start on Valo III, where an ad hoc leader named Jaz Holza lives. The Federation has had dealings with him. I met Holza at a symposium. What can you tell us, Doctor? I found him a very concerned leader and a good spokesman for his people. And a terrific dancer! No, really, I'm serious. At a reception afterwards. At least this man has genuine experience in diplomacy. A big advantage on this mission. Mr. Data, will you contact Holza, arrange a meeting? Sir. Ensign Ro, you know the star system. You'll take the conn. Is there a problem, Ensign? You're wasting your time. Holza is nobody. He's the token Bajoran that people invite to symposiums and diplomatic soirées. But he has no real influence among my people. Whom do you suggest we speak to? Don't you understand? These people are ready to martyr themselves. They don't want to talk. This ship will fight if necessary. It will be. Don't fool yourself. This mission will end in bloodshed. Let's hope that you're mistaken, Ensign. But can you point us at the right individual, as Mr. Data suggested? I would go to the camp on the southern continent of Valo II. Find a man named Keeve Falor. He has no diplomatic experience. And he won't ask you to dance. Captain's log, supplemental. I read about ancient Bajoran civilization in the fifth grade. They were architects and artists, builders and philosophers when humans were not yet standing erect. Now I see how history has rewarded them. This used to be me. Ro Laren. It's been a long time. Keeve Falor, Capt Jean-Luc Picard, Cmdr Data and Lt Worf. I'm pleased you agreed to meet us, Mr. Keeve. You honour me by the proper use of my name. Ensign Ro has educated me. Has she? I'm pleased you still remember. Let me show you our camp. We are not a violent race, Captain. Just passionate about our cause. That passion has led some to take up arms. Do you know where we can find Orta? I'm afraid not. Can you help us to locate him? Sorry. I don't wish to help you. Don't misunderstand. I believe the raid on the Federation outpost was poor judgement. You are innocent bystanders. I cannot condone violence against those who are not enemies. I don't see why you're unwilling. Because you are innocent bystanders. You were bystanders for decades as the Cardassians took our homes, as they violated and tortured our people, as we were forced to flee. We were saddened by those events, but they occurred within the borders of the Cardassian Empire. And the Federation is pledged not to interfere in the internal affairs of others. How convenient that must be for you, to turn a deaf ear to those who suffer behind a line on a map. I'm not here to debate Federation policy with you, but I can offer you assistance. Simply because of one terrorist attack? Well! Perhaps I should have known that. We should have attacked the Federation long ago. What do you think of that, Ro? You're a small man who feels a rush of power and enjoys it too much. Stop talking and listen. We've had problems with Cardassians. But now that we have a treaty, we're in a position to help. Your people have been forced to resettle all over the quadrant. But now we can make a legitimate case that this is not an isolated problem. We can work diplomatically on your behalf. But first, these terrorist attacks must end. We live in different universes, you and l. Yours is about diplomacy, politics, strategy. Mine is about blankets! If we were to exchange places for one night, you might better understand. Mr. Data, have the replicators provide a blanket for every man, woman and child before nightfall. Aye, sir. Mr. Worf. Determine their emergency needs and provide for them. Yes, sir. Thank you. Return to your ship. I will contact you when I have any information that might assist. Ensign. You were helpful. The blankets were helpful. Nothing I said mattered. In an age when their technology should be able to clothe and feed all of them, they should live like this. I couldn't, and I wouldn't. That's one reason I ran away. They're lost, defeated. I will never be. Captain's log, star date 45077. 8. Keeve Falor has kept his promise and directed us toward the third moon of Valo I where we will meet tomorrow with the terrorist leader Orta. Do you mind if we join you? Yes. If I'm on an away team with Ensign Ro, I won't turn my back on her. Perhaps the Captain felt she'd help the mission. That was orders. Had to be. She doesn't belong here. She doesn't even belong in the uniform. Really? Really. Sounds like someone I'd like to know. Excuse me. Am I disturbing you? Yes. Good. You look like someone who wants to be disturbed. I'd rather be alone. No, you wouldn't. I beg your pardon? If you want to be alone, stay in your quarters. The only reason to come here is to be amongst people. Who are you? My name is Guinan. I tend bar, and I listen. Heard anything interesting? Everyone's talking about you. Heard anything interesting? Well, it's all true. I believe truth is in the eye of the beholder. Isn't that supposed to be beauty? Truth, beauty. It works for a lot of things. They say you never told the true story of Garon II, and that you didn't defend yourself at your court martial. What was to defend? I didn't follow orders. Eight members of the away team died. Your fault? Yeah, my fault. So you sit alone in crowded rooms staring at your drink. I think you enjoy it. I enjoy it? You work so hard at torturing yourself, I think you must enjoy it. Who are you? I told you. I'm Guinan. I tend bar, and I listen. You're not like any bartender I ever met. And you're not like any Starfleet officer I've ever met. But that sounds like the beginning of a very interesting friendship. I don't stay anywhere long enough to make friends. Too late. You just did. Excuse me. Bridge to Ensign Ro. Go ahead. Subspace communication coming in for you, Ensign. Thank you. Computer, direct subspace transmission to monitor. Your report, Ensign. Everything is going exactly as you predicted, Admiral. Any weapons or vessels beneath the surface? The moon's surface is blocking the sensors. Which is why they chose this moon. We're on a timetable. Where's Ro? Picard to Ensign Ro. Computer, locate Ensign Ro. Ensign Ro is not aboard. Check the transport log. She beamed down six hours ago, sir. Any activity at the meeting site? No, sir. That didn't show up. What the hell is going on? Transport us to the same location Ensign Ro beamed to. Mr. Worf, phasers. I am picking up molecular-displacement traces, suggesting movement in the last ten hours. Try to determine their direction. Standard search pattern. Maintain security link. Mr. Worf, come with me. Data. I'm picking up energy fluctuations over here. Troi to Picard. Captain, acknowledge! Data to Picard. Data to Worf. Hold it! Capt Picard. I am Orta. Please forgive my appearance. Unfortunately, some years ago, as a guest of the Cardassians, my face was mutilated. My vocal cords were cut. It was not necessary to abduct us. I am sorry. But after speaking with Ro Laren, I decided that it was. She has done us both a disservice. I am committed to peace. I am not at all interested in peace. I am not convinced that you are either. I did not come here to undermine this mission. You've already damaged these negotiations. I wanted these people to listen to you. I didn't want it to end in bloodshed. There will be no bloodshed. You don't know the facts, sir. So share them with me. All is not what it seems. Perhaps someone is using you to get to me. Perhaps you are a victim of this deception. I do not know. Deception? Your mission was to find the Bajoran terrorists who destroyed a Federation settlement. Yes. As I have informed Ro Laren, it was not the Bajora. He admits dozens of attacks on Cardassian targets. Why believe him about Solarion IV? He has no reason to lie. He fears reprisal. I perceive no fear or deception from him. If they did not attack Solarion IV, who did? Why falsely implicate the Bajora? Perhaps someone wanted to draw us into the conflict. What would anyone gain from that? Ensign Ro. May I see you in my ready room? Yes, sir. Do not leave this ship without authorization. I'm sorry, but... This is not a discussion. You're restricted to your quarters for this mission. Dismissed. What? Hello. It's me, Guinan. I heard you got grounded. I really don't feel like talking right now. Come on, sure you do. Why is it, when I tell you something, you say I mean the opposite? You're one of those people who's got their poles reversed. Do you want to talk about it? It's nothing you can help me with. How do you know until you try? I got myself into this. I'm trying to figure a way out, that's all. Without anyone getting killed this time. Everybody's pulling my strings, like I've got no control. For people like you and me, who've lost their homes, sometimes that's the way life feels. I'm in trouble. There's more going on here than anybody on this ship realizes. It's more than I know how to deal with. I really don't know who to trust any more. Including yourself? Especially myself. You know, a very long time ago, I got into some serious trouble, too. And I mean serious. And I'd probably still be there if I hadn't trusted one man. Come. Ensign Ro has some things to talk to you about. Ensign Ro has been confined to her quarters. She can go back to her quarters when she's done. I don't know why you're involved, but... She's my friend. Please sit down. Guinan is very selective about whom she calls a friend. When I've finished telling you what I have to tell you, I'll probably end up back in the stockade. If that's the way it has to be, then... I just can't do this any more. What can you not do any more? Admiral Kennelly came to me in prison and said he'd get me out if I'd go on a mission. I know that part. No, sir. Not this mission. One for him, and only him. You were being sent to talk, to negotiate. The Admiral knew that was hopeless. My job was to give Orta an incentive. What kind of incentive? One that you couldn't offer. Nor could Starfleet. Orta was to end terrorism against the Federation and return with his people to the camps. In exchange, he would get weapons, ships, to really make a difference against the Cardassians. I find that impossible to believe. That Admiral Kennelly would supply weapons to the terrorists? If you ask him, he'll deny it. But it's true. I didn't leave the ship without authorization. I got it from the Admiral. You have been in contact with Admiral Kennelly? Yes, sir. The subspace log can confirm that part of it at least. Arming these people is a violation of all the Federation stands for. Even you cannot be blind to that! No, sir, I'm not. But this was something I had to do. You see, Captain, when I was seven years old, I was given a piece of sugar candy,... ..and I was led by a Cardassian into a room where my father was sitting. He looked at me with eyes I'd never seen. The Cardassian began to ask him questions. And during the next two hours, as I was forced to watch,... ..my father was tortured until he died. And I remember feeling so ashamed of him as he begged for mercy. I was ashamed of him for being weak. I was ashamed of being Bajoran. Later, I began to understand how misguided those feelings were. And yet somehow, they have remained a part of me. I don't want to be ashamed of my heritage any longer, Captain. I serve the Federation. But I am Bajoran. A Starfleet admiral gave me an opportunity to help my people in their fight against the Cardassians. I had to accept. Have you made this offer to Orta? No. After he told me the Bajora hadn't attacked Solarion IV, nothing made sense. I decided to wait until I knew what was going on. A wise choice. It probably saved you from another court martial. Have you briefed Admiral Kennelly since our return? No, sir. Captain, I don't know who to trust any more. But that strange bartender has a way of getting to you. She said that you were her friend. Then we have one thing in common. Do you think that Orta would cooperate to determine the truth? I think I can persuade him to. Good. Our orders were to find him, to bring him back to the camps any way we could. That's exactly what we should do. And then what? And then watch what happens. Captain's log, supplemental. I am convinced we are somehow involved in a conspiracy. I am hopeful the purpose behind it will be revealed in a few hours. Well done, Captain. It was a team effort, Admiral. Ensign Ro was invaluable. Good. What's the next step? The Enterprise will escort a Bajoran Antares-class cruiser to Valo III. Orta and his people will be aboard. Good. Keep us advised of your progress. Acknowledged. How's that Cardassian virus, Admiral? A lot better, thank you. I'm pleased. We'll report when our mission is accomplished. Ensign Ro, take us to the designated coordinates. Mr. Data, keep an eye on the Cardassian border. The Bajoran vessel is moving up from the surface. On screen. Hail them, Mr. Worf. Audio channel open. The ship does not have visual capabilities. This is Capt Picard. We're prepared to escort you to Valo III. Acknowledged. Our ship is limited to half-impulse. Ensign Ro, set a course for Valo III, half impulse. Aye, sir. There is increased activity in Cardassian space. Two ships moving along the border, heading 142, mark 051. Can you identify the class of those ships, Mr. Worf? Cardassian warships. Galor-class, type III. Top of the line. Their course is parallel to our own. Yellow alert. Continue to monitor them. Ensign Ro, what's the closest we come to the Cardassian border? 13,400 kilometres, sir. ETA? Eight minutes. That's where it'll be. The Cardassians are changing course. They are crossing the border. They have powered up their weapons. Red alert. Set a course to intercept the Cardassians. Open a channel to the Bajoran vessel. Open. This is the Enterprise. We will intercept two Cardassian warships. Maintain your present course. Acknowledged. The Cardassians are in visual range. On screen. They are hailing us, sir. Open a channel, Mr. Worf. This is Capt Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise. How can we help you? Gul Dolak, Cardassian militia 41. We have no argument with you, Captain. I'm pleased to hear that. The Federation values peace with our Cardassian neighbours. No more than we value relations with the Federation. Now we have established our mutual goodwill, what's on your mind? The Bajoran ship you are escorting is a terrorist carrier. Terrorist carrier? Are you certain? Most certain. It has committed crimes against us. We know its markings well. Rest assured, there will be no terrorist attacks today. We are escorting the Bajoran settlers to Valo III. You can monitor their course. We request that you withdraw and leave the matter to us. This is neutral space, Gul Dolak. You have no jurisdiction. Nor do you. If we withdraw, what do you intend to do with the Bajoran vessel? We intend to destroy it. I see. That puts me in a difficult position. I promised to escort these people. You are protecting the enemies of the Cardassians. If you do not withdraw, we will take great offence. I'm sorry to offend you, but we cannot withdraw. We will take any steps necessary. Is that intended as a threat? It is a complaint from your Cardassian neighbours. You have one hour to withdraw. Advise Starfleet of our status, Data. I'll speak to Admiral Kennelly in my ready room. It seemed, Admiral, that they knew our course, our destination, our plan. I'm sure they monitor the border for terrorist activity. Their sensors must have picked up Orta's ship. I'm not convinced of that. The important thing is, what do we do now? Do you have any suggestions? Your top priority is to protect the Cardassian treaty. We can't protect the Cardassian peace without sacrificing the Bajoran. If that's your call, I'll support it. No. I'm not willing to give them up. You're not looking at the big picture, Jean-Luc. We can't afford to lose the Cardassian treaty. I see a different big picture. It looks something like this. I see the Cardassian liaison, with his Cardassian virus, coming to meet with you after the attack on Solarion IV. ""Now we have a common enemy,"" he says. ""The Bajoran terrorists."" ""The Cardassians can't find them, but maybe the Federation can."" I'm beginning to see that our mission has, in fact, been to expose Orta, so that the Cardassians can move in and destroy him. I think you've lost your perspective, Captain. We'll discuss this further when you return. For now, I'm giving you a direct order to withdraw. Kennelly out. Ensign Ro, set a course, bearing 187, mark 102, one quarter impulse. Aye, sir. He's ordered us to withdraw? The Cardassians are moving toward the Bajoran vessel. Hold present course. The Bajoran ship has been destroyed. Subspace signal coming in from Starfleet. Admiral Kennelly. On screen. It is on a secure channel. In your ready room? No. Here. On screen. Report. The Cardassians have destroyed the Bajoran ship. All hands lost? No, sir. Survivors? No, sir. No one was on board. What are you saying? The ship was controlled from the ground. Communication was through a subspace relay. This was your idea, Picard? Actually, no. It was Ensign Ro's idea, but I endorsed it. I suspected this might occur. They're terrorists! Why protect them? I am more concerned with protecting the honour and integrity of Starfleet. You know how many of our people they killed on Solarion IV? The Bajorans did not attack Solarion IV. Who told you that? Orta? Yes. And you believed him?! Admiral, Orta's ships are old and obsolete. They don't have warp capabilities. They couldn't reach another star system, let alone attack one. Then who's responsible? I suggest you ask your friend, the Cardassian liaison. The only explanation I can think of is that the Cardassians staged it. The Cardassians? Why? Perhaps they hoped to find someone in Starfleet, like you, Admiral, naive enough to solve their Bajoran problem for them. What will happen to him? I'm not sure. A hearing, certainly. Probably a court martial. If he gets sent to the stockade on Jaros II, tell him to request a room in the east wing. The west wing gets awfully hot in the afternoons. How soon do you intend to return to Lya Station Alpha, sir? In a few weeks. We have surveying to do in Sector 21305. Perhaps I should arrange for some other transportation back. Ensign, you were recruited for one mission. If you wish to be relieved of duty, I could arrange it. But I'd like you to consider remaining in Starfleet. You're not serious? It would be a shame for Starfleet to lose someone of your potential. Well, thank you, Captain. But this uniform just doesn't fit, and you know it. That can change. I don't think so. I've noticed qualities in you that could be harnessed, moulded. Don't count on it. You've got a great deal to learn from Starfleet. I always thought Starfleet had a lot to learn from me. That's an attitude that I've found common among the best officers I've ever served with. You're not one of them yet, but you could be, if you work at it. That's an interesting challenge. I rarely refuse an interesting challenge. There would have to be one condition. Condition? Picard to Enterprise. Two to beam up. "
S5E04,"The hospital facility will be located there, facing north in that grove of trees. And the school and the arts centre will be there, centrally located among the residential pods. Very good. We'll be able to bring the next wave of colonists in six months. I envy you. This is a beautiful place to put down roots. Somehow, you don't strike me as the kind that puts down roots. No? How do I strike you? As a free spirit. As an adventurer. An adventurer? Aren't you pioneers adventurers? Of course, but we also have this nesting instinct. It's exciting to find a new world, but the joy is making it a home. Building houses, having children. Very interesting. I'd love to discuss this further with you. Dinner tonight? If you want to share camp rations, I'd be delighted. Haven't we got you a replicator? No, we haven't. But I've been saving up my ration of dried chicken curry. It should go nicely with that bottle of wine I know you brought. This is sounding better. And, as you know, I provide the most memorable desserts. My favourite part of dinner. Will? Carmen? We've been going over the hospital schematics. The location is fine. When the Enterprise comes back, we'll get a crew started. Carmen, has construction started? No. What is that? Data? I do not recognize the sound. I believe it is coming from above. Will, what is it? Data, what's our best bet for cover? Subterranean caverns to the east. Doctor. Gather everyone together. We've seen this before. We know what it is. Get moving. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Follow him! Let's go! Come on! Hurry up! No, stay together! This way! I got you. Will! Help us! Data! Carmen! Sensors indicate a disturbance near the outpost on Melona IV. What kind of disturbance? I cannot tell. It could be an electrical storm. See if you can contact the colony. Aye, sir. Captain, there is no response, but the disturbance is increasing. How far are we? At current speed, 27 hours. Bridge to La Forge. La Forge here. Are there any readings from Melona? Yes, sir. Something strange is going on. Violent disruptions in the atmosphere. Ensign, increase to warp eight. Come on! Keep moving. Watch your step, but keep moving. Let's go. Keep moving. Deeper into the cave. Come on. Deeper into the cave. Will this cave protect us? The refractory metal in the rock may act as a barrier. Let's seal off this entrance. Let's hope there's enough air in here. There's got to be a ventilation source somewhere. We need some light. How are the others? Just scrapes and bruises. Where's Carmen? She didn't make it. She was trying to save an old man who had fallen. I'm sorry. I think we'll be alright in here. I'm not sure about the air supply. So stay put. Don't move around. Don't expend any unnecessary energy. With any luck, we'll be able to wait this thing out. Riker to Enterprise. Riker to Enterprise. Commander. The refractory metal in the rock may affect communication. We've only seen the crystalline entity once. How do you know the metals will protect us? I am not certain they will. I was afraid you were going to say that. Sir, the disturbance on Melona is becoming more intense. Keep hailing them. All channels, Mr. Worf. The fact that they are not responding doesn't mean anything is wrong. The disturbance could be jamming the signal. I know, Counsellor. Still no response, sir. Increase to warp nine. How long, Mr. Worf? Six hours. I've got one man unconscious. We can't stay in here much longer. If we open that entrance and it's out there, we're dead. If we all stay in here, we're dead. It has been over an hour since we heard the entity. It may be gone. Or it may be waiting out there for us. Everybody stay here. Commander! Cmdr Riker, are you there? Lt Worf, I've never seen a more beautiful sight. It's good to see you're alright. What happened here? The crystalline entity paid us a visit. We lost two colonists. We got the rest in here. Captain's log, star date 45122.3. We have notified Starfleet Command of our intention to pursue and investigate the crystalline entity. We have been joined by Dr Kila Marr, a xenologist who has made studying the entity her life's work. Welcome. I'm Cmdr William Riker. Dr Kila Marr. Glad you're here. You were on the surface during the attack? That's right. Remarkable. Your group are the only known beings to survive an assault by the entity. We were lucky. I should say. Your android. He was there, too? Lt Cmdr Data was there, yes. Well, shall we get started? I'll show you to your quarters. A chance to talk to survivors so soon after an attack. I've been waiting years for this. I don't want to waste a moment. And when we came out of the cave, there was nothing left. Everywhere we looked, there was devastation. Trees gone, nothing. That's typical. It could take years for anything to grow again. Doctor, I ran a full spectrographic analysis. Trace elements confirm it is the entity which destroyed Omicron Theta. The crystalline entity functions like a gigantic electromagnetic collector. It needs a lot of power to keep going, so it strips every form of life and converts it all into energy. There is no vegetation, no insects, not even soil bacteria. Except witnesses, for the first time in 11 recorded attacks. Now why, I wonder, did it spare your group? It didn't spare everyone, Doctor. Two of the colonists did not survive. My point is, until now, there have never been any survivors. The cave in which we hid was made of rock which contained heavy concentrations of kelbonite and fistrium. The entity seemed unable to penetrate that barrier. I would like to interview each of the survivors, collect as much specific detail as I can. Of course. I'd like to inspect the remains of the colony. Data, accompany the Doctor to the surface. Yes, sir. I prefer to choose my own team. There is no one with more knowledge of the entity than Cmdr Data. He originated on Omicron Theta. I am aware of his origins. I am aware that his brother Lore worked with the entity, led it to Omicron Theta, where it killed every living thing. It is not unreasonable that I prefer to make another choice. You may request additional team members, but in the best interests of this investigation, I think you should work with Data. As you wish, Captain. Well? You don't need an empath to sense that woman's feelings. She has transferred hostility from Lore to Data. Perhaps you shouldn't have forced them together so soon. If her discomfort is going to affect her judgement, or her objectivity, I need to know now. Doctor, there is evidence of bitrious matter in the soil. It was not present before the attack. Doctor? Dr Marr, you have made it clear that my presence disturbs you. But I do not see how we can achieve our task if you ignore me. I can hear everything you say to me. If there is anything worth my response, I will not be silent. Then I do not understand your lack of interest in the bitrium. It's old news to me. I found bitrium on the last three attack sites. It seems to be a residual that the entity produces after it absorbs living matter. I am actually more interested in this cave. It still amazes me that your group was spared. As I speculated, the presence of refractory metals... Refractory metals, yes, I know. On two separate occasions, settlers sought refuge in caves. Some of them deeper than this one. They perished anyway. Were those caves laced with kelbonite or fistrium? The tunnels on Forlat III had strong deposits of kelbonite, yes. Perhaps the combination of the two metals prevented... Perhaps it was you. I do not understand. Maybe your presence made the entity pass over the people in this cave. Did that occur to you? I cannot see what effect my being here... If you had been in contact with the entity, if that's the reason Melona was attacked, it would not kill its ally. Do you believe that I lured the entity here? Did you? No, Doctor. Because Lore betrayed the colonists on Omicron Theta, you believe that I am capable of the same behaviour. You are mistaken. My programming is different from Lore's. I am accusing you of collaborating with that monster! I am attempting to explain to you it is impossible. Amazing! You can't feel anything, can you? Nothing I say to you hurts you! That is true, Doctor. I'm getting a slight elevation on monocaladium particulates in this cave wall. Are you making note of it? Yes, Doctor. My son died on Omicron Theta. He was 16 when the colony was attacked. That is the reason I have become an expert on the crystalline entity. I have spent my life studying it, tracking it and hoping, one day, to find it. And if I learn you have been helping that thing in any way whatsoever, I will see to it that you are disassembled piece by piece. We've input the data you collected on the surface. I have cellulose readings from soil samples that weren't included. You handle that unit like a veteran. If you spend your life gathering information, you learn your way around computers. Hydrocarbons slightly elevated. Bitrious filaments in trace amounts, lanthanides, nitrates. All normal. Nothing different. Everything is within the parameters I established at other attack sites. Did you expect a different result this time? I never surveyed a site so soon. I thought I'd find something new that would make a difference. Doctor, have you ever scanned your samples for gamma radiation? Why would I do that? High-energy reactions may show up in a gamma scan. If they do, we might find a marker left behind by the entity. That's a good idea, Data. Frankly, I don't see what that would get us. If the entity left a trace of antiproton in the samples, a gamma scan would reveal that. Getting that read-out now, Data. A logarithmic scale will give better resolution. There it is. Do you see it? Yes. Doctor? A sharp spike at 10 keV. Another. A pattern. So, the entity leaves antiprotons behind. If it also deposits them in space as it travels, can we detect them? Sure. We can set the ship's sensors for gamma radiation. Well, let's get to it, shall we? It seems I owe you thanks. The thanks go to Dr Clendenning of Omicron Theta who did the first experiments with gamma scans. That wasn't in his records. Correct. But I possess much of his knowledge. He was working on new detectors at the time of the attack on Omicron Theta. I heard you were programmed with the colonists' experiences. But I find it hard to believe. Bridge. It is true. Their logs and journals were transferred into my memory cells. The man who created me scanned the synaptic patterns of their temporal lobes and programmed them into my neural nets. You possess their thoughts? To some degree. Dr Soong hoped to give me an amalgam of the colonists' memories. Interesting. There. A spike. At 10 keV. And again. It's the same pattern we saw in Engineering. Data, can you project a course? There are two possible destinations. The Brechtian Cluster and the Argos system. Is either populated? Yes, sir. The Brechtian Cluster has two inhabited planets. Set a course for the Brechtian Cluster. I've done some estimates on a firing pattern to destroy the entity. The photon torpedoes require reprogramming. With your permission, I'll give the calculations to Lt Worf. Reprogram the torpedoes, but let's hope we don't have to use them. I beg your pardon? If we can avoid firing on it... Aren't you going to kill it? Perhaps you should join me in my ready room. Why are we pursuing the entity if not to destroy it? We're not hunters. Nor is it our role to exact revenge. Do you propose we track it down, greet it warmly and ask it if it would mind not ravaging any more planets? I don't deny that it may be necessary to fire on it. But that is a last resort. Why? Why not just kill it? I want to communicate with it. What? We know, from our own experience, that our shields will protect us. So long as we are in no danger, I will try to communicate. To what end? If we determine its needs, we might find other sources to supply it. Its needs are to slaughter people. It is a giant killing machine! The sperm whale on Earth devours millions of cuttlefish. It is not evil. It is feeding. The same may be true of the entity. Small comfort for those who died to feed it. This isn't about cuttlefish. It's about people! The crystalline entity has as much right to be here as we do. Cmdr Data has some theories on how we might communicate. Please confer with him. Come in. Am I disturbing you? Not at all. Commander, there's something I want to say. You have been helpful to me and kind. And I repaid you with accusations. I realize I may have been wrong. That is gracious of you, but I have not been injured by you. Capt Picard said you are trying to communicate with the entity. That is true. I have produced vibrations in crystals with graviton pulses. Like tapping on a crystal goblet? Exactly. I will call up the results I have achieved for you to study. Alright. Commander, just what kind of memories do you retain of the colonists? I do not possess minute-to-minute remembrances, although intense recollections are in my memory banks. Do you have any of my son's memories? Marr, Raymond. Called Renny. Yes, I do. I see. And his journals? Yes. I was wondering... Do you know...? Did he blame me? Blame you? For going away. For leaving him on Omicron Theta. There are no records of any blame. I left him with friends. I chose to pursue my own career. I planned to go back, but things kept interfering. I kept thinking, ""I'll go next month."" But there weren't any more ""next months"". There are no records of any negative thoughts about you. His journals indicated he was proud that you were such a fine scientist. He was? What else do you know? Cmdr Data, Dr Marr, report to the bridge immediately. We are being chased by an unidentified entity. A distress call from the Kallisko. It's being pursued by an unknown object. Sensors indicate a crystalline structure of indeterminate matter. How strong are your shields? We are a transport ship. Our shields are minimal. Do you carry weapons? Only low-level phasers. Do you know what this thing is? Change course. Do whatever you can to outrun it. We are under attack! Captain, notify our people on Boreal Ill. Mr. Worf, try to re-establish. I cannot, sir. There is no response. The crystalline entity is moving away, sir. Set a course for the Kallisko. Mr. Riker, prepare an away team. Captain's log, star date 45125. 7. An away team has conducted a thorough survey of the Kallisko and has returned to the Enterprise to report. As we expected, sir. No survivors. No trace of anything that was ever alive, not even a seed in their storage. The engines are down but can be restarted. We could take the ship to a star base. We don't have time. Mr. Worf, ask the nearest star base to dispatch a crew. Mr. La Forge, make sure we're picking up gamma radiation from the entity. Have you and Data found a means of communication? I believe so. There are things to iron out. Work at it. We may need it soon. Deck 17. Doctor, you have seemed preoccupied since we surveyed the Kallisko. I've found it easy... to talk to you, Commander. Do you mind if I tell you something? Not at all. After hearing the screams of those men, I found it hard not to think about my son. About what happened to him. I've read stories about soldiers in the battlefield, wounded, dying. They call out for their mothers. And I've often wondered if my son called out for me. If he died wondering why I didn't come to him. Come. It's still heading for the Brechtian Cluster. We've re-established our course. Very well. One thing, Number One. Starfleet will return Carmen's effects to her parents. Would you care to enclose a letter? Yes, sir. I'd like that very much. Is there something more, Number One? Permission to speak freely, sir? Of course. I've been thinking maybe Dr Marr's right. Maybe we should destroy the entity. Why do you think that? It's already killed thousands. It will continue to kill. I don't want those deaths on my conscience. Are you sure that that's it, or are you being influenced by personal feelings? With all due respect, sir, I'm not a raw cadet. I've lost people on missions before. If we take time to try to communicate with it, we may lose our chance to destroy it. I don't think we can risk that. I think I'll go write that letter to Carmen's family. We should vary the emissions we direct toward the entity. I'll write a subroutine that will allow us to change the frequency of the graviton beam. Data, you told me you carried some of my son's memories. That is correct, Doctor. What can you tell me about Renny? What were those thoughts? Was he happy at all on Omicron Theta? I have some vivid memories of sporting events. He played parisses squares with schoolmates. He started parisses squares when he was young. Too young, really. But the older children kept asking him to play. I couldn't stop him. He had this natural gift. Yes. He was pleased to have won a championship emblem. He wrote me about that. He was so proud. I'm characterizing pulse widths in nanoseconds. Sound right to you? Yes, Doctor. Your son's most intense memories revolve around a woman named Janina. A girlfriend? I never knew about that. The last person he would tell would be his mother. What was she like? He enjoyed her kindness, her gentleness, her physical attributes. There. Now we can vary all the parameters directly from the bridge. Yes, Doctor. Could you do something for me? It would mean a lot. I would be happy to be of help. You see, all I have left of Renny,... ..the only connection I have of him is there, inside your head. I was wondering if you would talk to me in his voice. I know you have the ability to sound like other people. It is true. But what would you have me say? Maybe... something from his journals? Many of his journal entries are letters to family and friends. I could access one of those. I took my last exam today. I think I did alright on everything except cellular biology. I know you think it's important, Mom, but I don't see how I'm ever gonna use that stuff. A bunch of us are going on an archaeological dig in the mountains. The Wallaces said it would be OK as long as we had adult supervision, so don't worry! They're looking out for me. They're really great people, and I like them a lot. But they're kinda serious. They don't have your sense of humour, Mom. Mom, I miss you. Captain's log, star date 45129.2. We are in pursuit of the crystalline entity. Data and Dr Marr are prepared to attempt communication when we intercept it. I am uncertain about the prospect. It could prove to be a triumph, or a catastrophe. The Brechtian Cluster is now five light years away. Are we picking up the entity? Yes, but not its exact whereabouts. We believe it's between here and the cluster. If I emit the graviton beam now, it may serve as a lure. A beacon. Make it so. Start with a pulse width of five nanoseconds. Frequency, one pulse per second. Commencing graviton emissions now. No change in sensor readings. Let's ramp the frequency. Emissions now at ten pulses per second. Sir. What is it? You have something? A large mass, approaching at warp speed. Full stop. Doctor, continue the signals. Mr. Worf, on screen. Shields up. Magnify. It's beautiful! What's it doing? Checking us out? Possibly. Just as we're checking it out. Dr Marr, do you wish to change the frequency? Dr Marr? Yes. Yes, proceed, Commander. Changing to 20 pulses per second. Is it responding to us? Let's test that. Ramp the frequency again, Commander. Emissions now at 30 pulses per second. I'm reading a transmission from the entity. Graviton pulses. It's working! That's a response to our signal. Remarkable. Captain! A pattern is emerging from the signals. It's trying to communicate with us. I believe so, sir. But it will take time to decipher the patterns. Then it's possible. Communication, understanding. Let me try something else. A continuous graviton beam. Pulses from the entity have stopped. Maybe it doesn't like what we're doing. Doctor, return to the intermittent signal. Doctor? Dr Marr? Dr Marr, we must return to the intermittent signal. Counsellor? Something's very wrong. The entity is beginning to resonate. Vibrations are increasing. Dr Marr, stop the transmission. That is an order. Dr Marr, do you hear me? It's for you, Renny. I did it for you. Data, shut down the transmission. Vibration is increasing. It can't last much longer. I cannot stop the signal. Dr Marr has isolated the access code. Maybe I can create an override sequence. Shut it down from here. The amplitude is rising. Resonance is critical. I can override, but it'll take time. Mr. Worf, escort the Doctor to her quarters. Yes, sir. It will never hurt anyone again. Perhaps I should escort the Doctor, sir. Fine. But don't leave her unattended. Please come with me, Doctor. Of course. I will stay with you, Doctor. How long will you live, Data? There has been no predetermined limit placed on my existence. I'm glad. As long as you're alive, he'll be alive. I need your help, Data. In what way, Doctor? Like you did before. Tell me that you understand, Renny. That you know I did it for you. Cos I love you! Because I wanted to give you peace at last. I do not find such a file in your son's journals, Doctor. However, from what I know of him, by his memories and his writing, I do not believe he would be happy. He was proud of your career as a scientist. Now, you have destroyed that. You say you did it for him, but I do not believe he would have wanted that. Yes, I believe your son would be very sad now. I am sorry, Doctor, but I cannot help you. "
S5E05,"Captain's log, star date 45156.1. Our mission to Mudor V has been completed. Since our next assignment will not begin for several days, we're enjoying a welcome respite from our duties. If it's a boy, Michael, after my father. Wait, we decided on Hiro, after my father. We talked about this last night. And decided on Hiro. Wait, I've got it. William. It's a great name, William O'Brien. It's got a nice ring to it. It's alright. He's just doing somersaults. Here, feel. Right there. He's gonna be a hell of a gymnast. May l? Sure. There, feel it? When he's not turning, he's kicking or punching. When I wanna sleep, he wakes up. At this point, I just wish it were over. I have to go. Transporter simulation on the bridge. Bye-bye, Michael. No. Come on, Geordi. No. Just try it once. It is not as hard as you think. I'm telling you, you will be terrific. Alright. I feel silly. I am the very model of a modern major-general I've information, vegetable, animal and mineral I can't do this, I cannot sing in front of people! You were terrific! A little off-pitch, but I can take care of that. OK, La Forge as a modern major-general. Captain, I'd like to introduce you to the winners of the primary-school science fair. This is Marissa, Jay Gordon and Patterson. They're here for their tour. Hello. Can we see the battle bridge and torpedo bay? No, I'm afraid not. But we will visit the hydroponics and astrophysics laboratories. I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time. Well, if you'll come with me. I'm not sure who to feel sorry for, the Captain or the kids. I want you to know, we're proud of our science-fair winners. Perhaps some of you will... choose to pursue a career in Starfleet. Well, then... What did you do for your science projects? I planted radishes in this special dirt and they came up all weird. I see. That's very, very commendable. And you? An analysis of the life span of the swarming moths on Gonal IV. They only live for 20 hours, then they all die. How interesting. And you? We're falling! What happened? Sensors show subspace distortions and high-energy particles to starboard. Looks like we ran into a quantum filament. Damage report. We lost primary life support. Switching to secondary. Impulse and warp engines are off line. Another filament approaching, sir. All decks, brace for impact. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Counsellor? I'm alright. Medical team to the bridge. Troi to sickbay. Counsellor Troi to Capt Picard. Troi to Engineering. Counsellor Troi to any crew member. Please acknowledge. Medical team to the bridge. Computer's down. Looks like we still have impulse power but not much else. Lt Monroe! Chief O'Brien. The turbo lifts aren't working. We're trapped. Are you children alright? Bridge, this is Picard. This is the Captain. Anyone read me? Why don't they answer? I don't know. They're all dead. They're not dead. Communication is down, that's all. We're going to die, too. We most certainly are not! Now listen to me. No one here is going to die. The bridge will be sending a rescue party soon. So I want you all to stop crying. Everything is going to be alright. This is the Starship Enterprise calling any vessel in range. We are in distress and need assistance. Please respond. I'm not sure if we're even transmitting. I'll set it on auto-repeat, see if we get a response. Are you alright? I'm alive. What the hell happened? We were hit by a quantum filament. Most systems are down. We can't contact anyone off the bridge. Don't count on leaving through there. An emergency bulkhead closed. Confinement mode. Isolation protocol. I'm not really familiar with that protocol. If the computer senses a hull breach, it closes emergency bulkheads to isolate it. Until we clear those, we're cut off from the rest of the ship. Partial sensors back on line. Picking up sporadic life signs throughout the saucer section. There are survivors. What about ten-forward? Ten-forward? My wife's there. Sorry. The readings are not that specific. Can you scan the drive section? No life signs in the drive section. Could it be a sensor malfunction? No way to know. Without the main computer, I can't run a full diagnostic. Can you sense anything, Counsellor? There are a lot of people still alive. Many are hurt, but I can't tell where they are. We need emergency procedures. Who's the duty officer? Lt Monroe was in command, but she's dead. I believe Counsellor Troi is the senior officer on the deck. Counsellor Troi? She carries the rank of lieutenant commander. I'd appreciate some suggestions. I recommend we initiate Emergency Procedure Alpha Two. Bypass computer control and place all systems on manual override. Very well. Aye-aye, sir. May I suggest that our next priority be to stabilize life support and to re-establish communications? Yes. Mr. Mandel, I'd like you to assist Ensign Ro. Yes, sir. How are you feeling? OK. A little foggy. Lie still. We'll get you to sickbay soon. OK. Report. I have surveyed all the turbo lifts and service crawlways. Access to the bridge is severed. Sickbay? Heavy damage to section 23A has cut off access to sickbay. Security will bring casualties here until further notice. Assume the worst, that everyone on the bridge is dead. No one controls the ship. In that circumstance, re-establishing control is our priority. Agreed. Can we get to Engineering? No, sir. The most direct route is blocked, but we can use a crawlway. OK. You and I will try. Mr. Worf, this room will fill up with wounded, needing help. Stay in charge here. Yes, sir. Let's go. Over here. Yes, sir. OK. Clear the power shunt. The shunt is cleared. Right. And bypass the flow current and... The computer still won't release the doors. Can we force them open? We can try. There's an emergency hand actuator. Geordi? Yeah? This wall is hot! Where? I'm alright. But I think we have a new problem. One of the energy conduits must have ruptured and ignited the polyduranide in the bulkhead. That's a plasma fire. Putting out a lot of radiation. We can't stay here for long. We got a bigger problem than that. The quartum in those containers is used in emergency thrusters. It's normally stable, but expose it to radiation, it has a way of exploding. The external power is cut off. We're going to die. What was that? I don't know. Your name is Marissa, is that right? Well, Marissa, I need a first officer to help me. You're the eldest, so that makes you my number one. Number one? That's what I always call my first officer. So, here. There. Now, Number One, we need a crew to help us get that hatch off. Don't you think Jay would make an excellent science officer? Jay, will you join our crew? It's Jay Gordon. Of course. Forgive me, Jay Gordon. I accept. Here. There. Can I be an officer, too? Well, let me see. Your science project involved radishes, did it not? Yes, sir. Then I appoint you my executive officer in charge of radishes. There. Right. Then let's get to work. 1365 Baker. That puts us right behind shuttle bay two. Correct. We have 52 meters remaining in this crawlway before we can safely exit into a corridor. Coolant leak! We can withstand this radiation for three or four hours without permanent damage. We'll need hyronalin treatments. Radiation levels in the quartum? They're at 83 rads and rising at four rads per minute. That stuff gets unstable at about 350 rads. I still can't get power to this transporter. The radiation level is 20 percent lower at this end of the bay. Let's move the containers here. Good idea. It'll buy us some time. We'll have to do this by hand. With all this radiation, we can't trust the antigrav units. There. Just before the second hit. See the subspace distortion? Yes. How big is a quantum filament? It can be hundreds of metres long. But it has almost no mass, which makes it very difficult to detect. So, it's like a cosmic string? No, that's a completely different phenomenon. How did you do that? I diverted power from the phaser array and dumped it in the Engineering control system. You what? Engineering station's on line. But that's a completely improper procedure! You can't dump raw energy into a bridge terminal... We will not get out of this by playing it safe! What is our engine status, Ensign? We've got half-impulse power available. But I've got odd readings from the warp drive. I read a spike in the warp-field array. It looks like a containment deviation. Switch to primary bypass. Nothing. Field strength's at 40 percent and falling. We've got a problem. The quantum resonance caused a polarity shift in the antimatter containment field. When the filament hit, the ship was momentarily charged, as if it came in contact with a live electrical wire. That weakened the containment field around the antimatter pods. The field strength is at 40 percent and falling. If it falls to 15 percent, the field will collapse and we'll have a containment breach. Which means? Which means the ship will explode. Commander, the current cannot be shut off from this relay box. We can't just sit here. If the energy were interrupted by a non-conductive material, it is likely the circuit would be broken. We have nothing to handle so much current. Commander, much of my body framework is made up of tripolymers, a non-conductive material. You're suggesting we use your body? Yes, sir. There's half a million amps in that arc. Could your body handle that? The power surge would cause a systems failure in my processors and melt my primary power couplings. But there is a chance the damage would not be irreparable. No. Commander, our options are very limited. Android or not, I wouldn't ask anyone to take that risk. And if the computer is not working in Engineering I'll need your help to control the ship. My positronic brain has shielding to protect me from power surges. It is possible for you to remove my cranial unit and take it with you. Let me get this straight. You want me to take off your head? Yes, sir. Is something wrong, sir? Well, Data... Would you be alright? My memory and neural nets are self-contained. I would be fine. Well, like you said, our options are limited. Data! A remarkable experience. Are you alright? Did the shielding work? Apparently so, sir. My neural nets are still fully operational. You may begin by opening the ventral access panel two centimeters below my right ear. Can you climb up? Yes, I think so. Good. Look down the sides of the lift. Can you see two big clamps? Yes, I see them. Can you see if those clamps are attached to... ..long beams inside big grooves? Yes. But one of them looks broken. It's half out of the groove. Alright. Come down. Alright. Number One. Those big clamps are part of the emergency system. If anything goes wrong, they hold the turbo lift in place. But it would seem that they're damaged. Is that why we keep shaking? That's right. Now, when they give way, we shall fall. So you've got to get your crew out of here before that happens. Now there is a ladder that runs along the wall of the shaft. You can climb up that until you come to an open doorway. What about you? My ankle is broken. I will just slow you down when you need to move quickly. Now, you are the leader. And that's an order. We have to climb up the shaft. I want to stay here with you, Captain. Patterson, you're an officer. You have to obey orders. I don't wanna be an officer any more. I wanna stay with you. If the Captain stays here, we won't make it. We'll all die. We don't have time to argue. You must go now. The crew has decided to stick together. We all go or we all stay. Alright. I'll try. But I want you to know, this is mutiny. Now, Number One, look at that control panel. Now, the yellow control pad, hit that once. Now the one below it, hit it twice. That should release the panel underneath. Yes, it did. Now, you can pull it away. OK. Good. That bundle of wires, that's optical cabling. See how much of that you can pull out. The levels are still rising. There must be a way to put that fire out. It's fed by the ship's internal power grid. We can't get near that. The only way to stop it would be to eliminate its supply of oxygen. Wait a minute! Doctor, I've got an idea. It's wild, but we just might kill two birds with one stone. Let's hear it. OK. We open the external door, depressurize the cargo bay to suck these containers out. At the same time, the lack of oxygen should put out the plasma fire. What about us? We hold on to something while the air evacuates. Then, we close the door, repressurize the bay. What about this? Yeah, that ought to do it. There, that should do it. There will be a sharp pain as I set the bone. Prepare yourself. Good. You bore that well. Keiko? I'm alright. I think. Perhaps you should lie down. I'm having contractions. That is not uncommon in the late months of pregnancy. No, I mean contractions. I'm going into labour. You cannot. This is not a good time, Keiko. It's not open for debate! Like it or not, this baby is coming. If the containment-field strength continues to drop at this rate, we still have two hours before it's critical. You're ignoring the fact that the power coupling is also damaged. If it overheats, the field strength could drop a lot faster. We could have a breach in minutes. What do you suggest? We should separate the saucer, and get as far away as we can from the drive section. Excuse me, sir, but that's damn cold-blooded! What about the people there? There's no evidence anyone's alive. No evidence they're dead, either! If you were trapped, would you like us to just leave? No, of course not. But I also wouldn't expect the bridge crew to risk the ship and hundreds of lives to rescue me. There is no way to stabilize the containment field from here. Could it be done from Engineering? Yes. But my readings indicate there's no power there. They don't even have monitors to say there's a problem. Could we divert energy from the bridge to those monitors? Yes, sir. I will say it again, there is no reason to believe that anyone is still alive in Engineering. We're wasting time talking about it. We have to separate the ship now! I believe there are still people alive down there. I'm going to give them every chance. If they're alive, they're hoping someone can help them. So we'll help them. Divert the power to Engineering. Aye, sir. I remind you, Counsellor, that power coupling could overheat at any moment. By not separating the ship, you could be responsible for all our deaths. Thank you, Ensign. Proceed. I can't open this door. We're going to have to climb up to the next deck. What if that one doesn't open either? Then we'll never get out. Quiet, both of you. That's an order. We're going up. Ready? Ready, sir. The lift's falling! Hang on! We're alright. We'll keep on climbing. Just don't look down. What's wrong? He's scared. We're right with you, Patterson. You're not going to fall. It will be alright if you keep climbing. What we need is a climbing song. Marissa, is there a song you sing at school? The Laughing Vulcan and his Dog? I'm afraid I don't know that one. I know. Frére Jacques. That's a song I used to sing at school. Patterson! Do you know that one? Good. It goes like this. Frére Jacques, frére Jacques Dormez-vous? Dormez-vous? Sonnez les matines, sonnez les matines Ding-ding-dong, ding-ding-dong Very good. Now keep singing. Frére Jacques, frére Jacques Dormez-vous? Dormez-vous? Sonnez les matines, sonnez les matines Ding-ding-dong, ding-ding-dong Frére Jacques, frére Jacques Dormez-vous? Dormez-vous? Sonnez les matines, sonnez les matines Ding-ding-dong, ding-ding-dong Frére Jacques, frére Jacques... Your contractions are now only 30 seconds apart. Dilation has gone to seven centimeters since the onset of labour. That did not take long. That's easy for you to say! You are doing very well. I'm sure the child will arrive soon. Worf, has the baby turned? Turned? So the head is down. Dr Crusher told me a few days ago it hadn't. She wasn't worried because I still had a month to go. I am not certain. Can't you tell? Worf, have you ever done this before, delivered a baby? Yes. No. I took the Starfleet Emergency Medical course. In a computer simulation, I assisted in the delivery of a human baby. Sometimes it doesn't go by the book, Worf. I am sure everything will be fine. Once the air is vented, you'll feel extreme pressure on your lungs. Resist the temptation to exhale. Next our hands and feet will get cold, then numb, and some of the capillaries on exposed skin may burst. Sounds like fun. We will have about 15 seconds of useful consciousness, then about ten seconds of disorientation, then we pass out. OK. Once the air is evacuated, one of us needs to get to that panel to repressurize the bay. We're ready. Are you OK? The field strength is down to 20 percent. We cannot risk staying here. We're in no danger until it drops below 15 percent. We can wait and see if Engineering notices those monitors. Have you prepared to separate the saucer? Yes. We're in stand-by mode for docking latches. Thermal inversion in the power coupling! Cross-connect to the transfer coil. That was close. What happened? What I said might! The coupling overheating and the field almost collapsed. O'Brien's fixed it temporarily, but it could go at any moment. Next time we might not be able to stop it. Don't let wishful thinking guide your decision. It's time to leave. We will separate the ship when I decide that it's time and not before. Is that clear, Ensign? Yes. Perfectly. OK, try it. Very good, Commander. You have established a connection. I can now raise the door. There's no power on this deck, yet these monitors are working. The power reaching those monitors is diverted from the bridge, sir. But why? Unless there's something they want us... Something they need us to see. Wait! The containment field is only 18 percent. Can you stabilize it? No. I do not have access to the containment field. You must establish a new link. Locate the ODN conduit, sir. Got it! Yes, sir. You must now change the input matrix of my secondary optical port and then connect the ODN conduit. That is not the correct port, sir. Sorry. You must hurry. The containment field has dropped to 16 percent. I'm trying. You need a bigger head! The field continues to drop. Collapse is imminent. Try it now. I have made a connection. I am now stabilizing the containment field. Sir, the field strength is stabilizing. 18 percent. 20. 25. I guess they got our message. I was wrong, Counsellor. You could have easily been right. Congratulations. You are fully dilated to ten centimeters. You may now give birth. That's what I've been doing! Well, bearing down is the next stage. It should start at full dilation. Why has it not begun? I don't know! I don't think it's up to me. It happens when it happens. The computer simulation was not like this. That delivery was very orderly. Well, I'm sorry! Did you feel an uncontrollable urge to push? Good. You are bearing down. Now, you must push with each contraction. I must urge you gently but firmly to push harder. Push, Keiko. Push hard. Push, Keiko! Push. I am pushing! The baby is emerging head first. Good. One more contraction. OK! That's good. Push. Push. Hard. I have the baby. I will smack the child to induce breathing. I will cut the umbilical cord. Blanket. OK. I believe she looks like Chief O'Brien. Hello. You were wonderful, Worf. I couldn't have done it without you. Hello. Captain's log, supplemental. We are en route to Star base 67 to undergo repairs. Life aboard the ship is slowly returning to normal. Now just wait here. Just can't stay away from the big chair, can you? I'm not cut out to be captain. First officer, maybe. I understand there aren't many qualifications. Capt Picard to the bridge. Please! Hello. It's good to see you again. What brings you to the bridge? In appreciation for the way you helped us out of the turbo shaft and the way you helped us not be scared, we want to present to you this commemorative plaque. Give it to him. Thank you. Thank you very much. I made the back piece. A wonderful job you did of it, too. This afternoon, we're going to finish the tour I promised, starting with the battle bridge. I'll see you at 1400 hours. Take the bridge, Number One. Aye, sir. Aye, sir. "
S5E06,"Etana! I know you're back there. Don't make me come after you! Give me that! You don't need that! Yes, I do. I need that communicator! Cmdr Riker to Enterprise. I have a terrible problem here on Risa! Give me that! Go get it. I don't believe you did that. Believe it. What is this? It's a game. Everyone here's playing it. It's fun. Do I keep my eyes open or closed? Open. What am I seeing? The playing field. Now what? You see the disc and the cone? Yeah. Concentrate. Make the disc go into the cone. How do I do that? Just let go. Relax. You'll do it. What was that? Your reward for clearing the first level. How far does this game go? As far as you can take it. Would you like to go for level two? Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, star date 45208.2. Cmdr Riker has rejoined the Enterprise from Risa. We're on our way to an uncharted area called the Phoenix Cluster. We're all anticipating this historic first look at the region. It's getting busy here. Five new science teams beamed in. Quarters are filling up fast. And there's a change. We've been given only two weeks to explore. Two weeks? That's not enough. I thought we had five weeks. Starfleet has added a diplomatic mission to Oceanus IV. Will, ensure that each science department has an equal chance to do their research. That'll be quite a juggling act. And some good news. We're to meet a shuttle carrying Wesley Crusher. He's on vacation from the Academy. Good. We'll need an extra hand. Geordi, how are the survey preparations? I'm up to my neck in schedules now. Our biggest hurdle is sensor availability. Especially with two new exobiologists and three stellar cartographers. 15 teams, two weeks and one long-range array. Not a great combination. Lateral sensors? Booked solid. Gamma-ray scanner? Reprogramming them now. Lefler, a moment, please. You know Robin? Of course. Her work's so sensational, I made her a mission specialist. Congratulations. Thank you. OK, what's our sensor status? We're increasing bandwidth so more science teams can use the sensors at once. We're multiplexing the array. Will that be done before we arrive? Yes, sir. Count on it. Keep it up, Lefler. I brought something from Risa that you have got to try. I'd love to, but I'm running a full sensor recalibration in ten minutes. Can it wait? Of course. I'll see you later. Chocolate ice cream, chocolate fudge and chocolate chips. You're not depressed, are you? I'm fine, Commander. Shall I leave you two alone? No, you can join us. No, thanks. I don't like fudge. Really? I never met a chocolate I didn't like. Doesn't it taste good? Of course it does, but... it's not just a matter of taste. It's the whole experience. First of all, you have to spoon the fudge around the rim, leaving only the ice cream in the middle. Then, you gently spoon the ice cream around the sides... ..like you're sculpting it. Relish every bite. Make every one an event. And then... with the last spoonful, close your eyes. I had no idea it was such a ritual. Chocolate is a serious thing. I brought something back from Risa. Better than chocolate. What is it? Just a game. Chief O'Brien. Welcome back, Wesley. Congratulations on Molly. Wait till you see her. She's the spitting image of her dad! So, where is everybody? Is my mom around? In a meeting. You're to go to your mother's quarters. Would it be alright if I dropped in to say hi? I'll check. Chief O'Brien to bridge. Bridge here. Wesley Crusher has arrived and wants to know if he can stop by the observation lounge to say hi. I suppose that is acceptable. Thanks. Surprise! Mom! Welcome home. Hi, Mom! Wesley! Captain! Quomodo tua Latinitas est? Praestat quam prius. Oppido bonum. Your Latin has improved. You look handsome. You do that cadet uniform justice. I bet you drive the girls wild. Wesley, Tarvokian pound cake. I made it myself. Thanks, Worf! Was our attempt to make you uncomfortable effective? You bet! For a second, I thought I was on the wrong ship. You found our deception pleasing? Yeah. It's fun to be surprised. Are you here to work or play? Sir. I know you're on vacation and probably want to go on the holodeck. But if you want, we could use your help with the survey. Sounds great, sir. Excellent! Come to Engineering and we'll get you started. So, what kind of game is this? Come by my quarters and I'll show it to you. You found the Academy challenging? Yeah. I thought after the Enterprise it would be a breeze, but there's a lot more to learn than starship operations. What was your first year like? I did well scholastically, but my lack of human understanding created social obstacles. Like what? I remember the phenomenon of practical jokes, several of which I fell victim to. Tell me about it! My first week there, this guy named Adam Martoni reprogrammed the sonic shower to cover me with mud. It took me a while, but I got him back really good. Good for you. Thanks. I also found social gatherings difficult. There was one event, an Academy tradition, the Sadie Hawkins Dance? They still hold it, every year! A notably awkward experience. I know. I can't even dance. Really? Your mother is quite an expert. She recently taught me. The Dancing Doctor? She tried to teach me, but I don't have the knack. I would be happy to teach you dancing. I have programmed a 17-part course with some interesting holographic partners. I'll let you know. I'll modify the planetary scanners. We need enough data lines open for the stellar physics. I'll compress the signal flow. Why aren't these registering? Try calibrating them manually. Excuse me? The detectors get temperamental. Try calibrating them by hand. You're kidding? The computer has to do this. No. Look. The subroutine lets you do it from the panel. Law 17. When all else fails, do it yourself. It's working! Thanks. Sure. By the way,... I'm Wesley. Wesley Crusher. I know. Just back from the Academy. That's right. Robin Lefler. Hi. Hi. Your neutrinos are drifting. They're what? Geordi, a conflict has arisen between the evolution team and the stellar physicists. Each wishes to use the thermal imager first. Tell them to flip a coin. We've got to work together on this mission. A coin. Very good. I will replicate one immediately. Dr Crusher to Data. Data here. Can you join me for a minute in sickbay? I need your help. Yes, Doctor, on my way. You wanted to see me? Yes, I need you to do something. I'm experimenting with bio-active silicon. Would you reprogram this tricorder to these specifications? Certainly. Sorry to bother you, but I need it done quickly. It does not bother me, Doctor. In fact, I am happy... Computer, secure sickbay. All entries to sickbay are secured. Let's see, I have Novakovich for anthropology, and Horne for creative writing. Walter Horne? Is he still teaching? Yeah, he is. And he's good, too. And you'll be pleased to know I took your advice. The first week I was there, I went and met Boothby. How is old Boothby? I hope he didn't tell you a lot of stories about me. He didn't remember you, sir. At first. I found an old yearbook photo and he remembered right away. He said he's very proud of you that you're Captain of the Enterprise. Is he still tending grounds? Or have the years caught up with him? Not that I can tell. He took me on a grand tour, showed me every blade of grass, practically. I had the very same tour. Sir, what do the initials AF stand for? AF? Boothby said he caught you carving them into his prized elm tree. AF... Just an acquaintance of mine. Wesley, if you meet someone whose initials you want to carve into that elm tree, don't let it interfere with your studies. I failed organic chemistry because of AF. Crusher to Capt Picard. Go ahead, Doctor. I need you in sickbay immediately. On my way. He complained of a servo-malfunction but my scans were negative. Then he collapsed. What have you found? His biosystems and positronic functions check out. His power cells are active. His higher functions are intact but signals aren't getting from his brain to the rest of his body. It's like a coma. Data performs regular self-diagnostic routines. We should check his logs. I recommend going through his quarters, too. Agreed. Continue the analysis. Keep me informed. Standard security sweep shows nothing unusual. Personal logs, diagnostics, duty logs, they all appear normal. There's nothing to cause a shutdown. We should ask his cat. I'd better get back to sickbay, see if there's any change. Dr Crusher has it under control. If there's a change you'll be told. I guess so. Looks to me like you need a break. Unwind a little. Yeah, maybe you're right. I've got just the thing. Why don't you join me in ten-forward? There's something I'd like you to try. Conduits 12 and 22 are still down for testing. We can re-route through junction 14B. You have a funny way of looking at the configuration, but it works. That's Law 36. You've gotta go with what works. What are these laws? My personal laws. When I learn something essential I make a law, so I don't forget. How many do you have? 102, so far. The starboard array needs another subprocessor. It'll be on line. I'm ahead of you. They said you were good. Why do I get the feeling you already know me? I have friends at the Academy. Your name's come up a couple of times. That was some stunt you pulled on Adam Martoni in the lab. How did you get the antimatter regulator to spray chilli sauce? There is another side to that story. Is it true what they say about your birthmark? This isn't fair. I hardly know anything about you. That's Law 46. Life isn't always fair. Yeah, I know that law. I still have to work on the sensor relays, but I'd like a chance to even the score. Ten-forward, 1900 hours. Join me for coffee? No. But I'll meet you for dinner. Captain's log, supplemental. We have reached the Phoenix Cluster. But it will take time to find the best location from which to conduct our survey. Cmdr Data's condition remains unchanged with no further indication as to the cause of his collapse. Mom? Wesley! What are you doing? I'm embarrassed to say. This was meant for you. But it was so much fun, I couldn't resist. What is it? It's a game. Riker brought it back from Risa. Everybody's playing it. Want to try? Maybe later. How's Data? Geordi's still working on him. He'll be fine. I should give him a hand. No! Wesley, you are on vacation. You have done enough already. Yeah, maybe you're right. Computer, increase light level. Are you in a hurry? Yeah, I'm late for a dinner date. Really? With who? Robin Lefler from Engineering. Why don't you invite her here? We can all play the game together. I can replicate a couple more. Mom! Sorry. It's just that I wanna spend some time together while you're here. We'll get time together, I promise. OK. OK. Just one game, come on. Try it on. Mom! I really need to get ready. Have a good time. Thanks. I will. When your parents are the only plasma specialists in the sector, you do a lot of travelling around from base to base. I felt like a piece of luggage. I spent all my time around equipment. My first friend was a tricorder. Really? My very first friend was a warp coil. My parents' work came first. They didn't really have time for me, even when I needed them. So that's how I learned my first law. Law one. You can only count on yourself. Sounds kind a lonely. Well, now you're here. Now I'm here. Well, I'm glad. You wouldn't believe it in Engineering. La Forge and the rest are crazy about a game. What kind of game is it? A Risian gadget that fits over your ear. Have you played it? Not yet. My mom has one. She keeps trying to get me to play it. It's everywhere. See what I mean? Don't you think that's a little strange? Everybody playing it all the time? It's a fad. Next week, we won't know it existed. I wonder how it works. Why don't you try it and find out? I'd like to know a little bit more about it first. I bet if we worked together we could figure it out. Yeah! We could hook it up to one of the computers. The medical programs in the lab can emulate human responses. It uses a visual interface. We could connect it through an optical sensor. I've loaded the neurological behaviour program. The sensor will allow the computer to process whatever the game sends. Let's see what happens. OK. It's activating the reticular formation. There's heavy synaptic activity all over the place. I wonder what happens after prolonged exposure. Speed up the processor. We'll find out. It seems centred around the frontal lobe. Computer, enhance frontal lobe. Full spectrum. It's stimulating the septal area. That's the pleasure centre of the brain. Whatever this does, it must feel pretty good. No wonder it's so popular. Look at this. Serotonin levels are way off. Let's run a neurochemical analysis. I'm seeing widespread bonding to neuro-receptors. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this looks like a psychotropic reaction. Are you saying you think the game's addictive? What's going on in the prefrontal cortex? Doesn't that area control higher reasoning? Yeah, it sure does. I'd better go talk to the Captain. Come. Sorry to bother you, sir. It's no bother. Please, sit down. Thanks. How are the survey preparations? Fine. But that's not why I'm here. What then? There's a game going around. It's something Cmdr Riker brought from Risa. It's a device that hooks around the ears. Yes, I've seen it. I did some preliminary tests on the game. What I found leads me to believe it may have harmful side-effects. Specifically, I think it's psychotropically addictive. Addictive? What have you discovered? It initiates a serotonin cascade in the frontal lobe. I know that's nothing conclusive, but it could explain its attraction. And at the same time it stimulates the brain's reasoning centre. I don't know what that's about. I'll start an investigation immediately. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Wesley? It's good to have you back again. Have you tried this? I've tried it. Thanks. It's great. Robin! Where have you been? Everybody's after me to try it. I know. Me, too. I talked to the Captain. He's gonna look into it. I hope he makes an announcement. This thing is giving me the creeps. Did you forget your game? We left them in our quarters. Well, use mine! No, thanks. Try it! She said, ""No, thanks."" Know what else is weird? lf it's so addictive, there's only one person who wouldn't be affected. Data! Right. And he got injured right when the game was brought on board. We'd better take a look at him. Maybe you should go check again. The nurse is still playing the game. I don't understand. There's brain activity. His systems are working. How can that be? He's unconscious. Maybe there's a signal breach between his brain and his body. Let's map his neurosystem and see if we can isolate a weak link. Patch the neural output through to that station. Here! The signal stops just below his cortex processor. There's some kind of damage. It's almost unreadable. Let's look at it on the viewer. Wesley, look at that! Some of his positronic links have been severed. The cuts are precise. Look how clean the edges are. Computer, increase magnification, factor four. Only two people on board know enough about Data to do this. Cmdr La Forge... and my mother. Why would one of them do this to him? Maybe there's more going on here than we thought. What if someone is using the game for something other than pleasure? Data would be a threat to that plan. Only with Data out of the way would everyone become addicted. And everyone has. Except us. We have reached the coordinates. A ship is on an intercept course. Advise them of our status, Mr. Worf. Go. Replicate what you need. See that the devices are properly distributed. Not forgetting Mr. Crusher. Wesley? Wesley? In here, Mom. It worked. Keep these mock-ups with us. We can't trust anyone, not even the Captain. I'm on duty. I've gotta go before Cmdr La Forge suspects. When you get there, access the codes to the security tracking system. There's something I want to try. Wesley, don't forget Law 91. Always watch your back! You, too. The vessel is approaching, Captain. Computer, all senior officers report to the bridge. On screen. Report. Welcome, Etana. The Enterprise has been secured. We await your further instructions. The expansion will proceed as follows. Cmdr Riker, pilot a shuttlecraft to the Cleon system, and rendezvous with the Endeavour. Proceed to distribute the device to that vessel. Cmdr La Forge, Counsellor Troi, take a shuttle to Star base 67. Distribute the device to all starships currently docked there. We have an opportunity to introduce the game to Starfleet Academy. Excellent! See to it. The Ktarians commend your efforts, Picard. Once the expansion is complete, you and your crew will be rewarded. Deck 36. Wesley, at what level are you? I'm only level ten. I'm at level 47! That's great. You know what the secret is, don't you? Don't force it. If you just let the game happen, it almost plays itself. I'll try that. I think we'll be OK. Just help me compile the force-field overrides. What are you doing? I created a transporter program. If things get difficult, this'll keep us one step ahead. Were you able to access the security tracking codes? Robin? It's your turn. Play the game, Wesley. Get back here! Computer, activate security containment. Deck 36, section 52! Computer, transport program Crusher one. We lost Crusher. It appears he rigged a site-to-site transport. Alert condition three. Computer, shut down all transporters and shuttle bays. Mr. La Forge? I can't track him, sir. He's done something to the sensors. I'll try bypassing his subcommands. Hold on. I'm picking up his trail, sir. Sensors show power activation in transporter room three, deck six. Seal off deck six. Activate Security fields, sections 23 to 29. Aye, sir. Got him, Captain. Section 25. He's trying to cut through the field. Security to deck six, section 25. On our way. You check left. Where the hell is he? I am trying to isolate him with thermal sensors. Narrow the scan field. Go deck by deck. Unfortunately, he knows our procedures. He will avoid all corridors and public areas. An unidentified heat source. Deck seven, section 23. There! No! Let go of me! It's OK, Wesley. You led us quite a chase, Mr. Crusher. Dr Crusher. No! Hold him steady. It's OK, Wesley, it won't hurt. No! You'll like it. His eyes. That's right, Wesley. Just let it go. Yes. Just let yourself go. Relax. Computer, resume normal illumination. Mr. Worf, you will find a small alien ship off the starboard bow. Secure it and raise our shields. Engaging tractor beam. Are you alright, Captain? I think so, Mr. Data. Captain, we are being hailed by the alien vessel. On screen. Explain yourself, Picard! The explanation is simple. You have failed to capture our ship. Release us immediately or we will open fire! Tactical analysis, Mr. Worf. Their weapons systems are substantially inferior to ours. They are not a threat. Get her off the screen. I can't believe what we were about to do. Data, we deactivated you. I managed to reconnect his positronic matrix. Wesley's diversions gave me time to modify the palm beacon. The optical-burst patterns counteracted the game's effects. The rest of the crew? We programmed the computer to transmit the optical burst to display screens throughout the ship. That should reach most people. Take a medical team for the rest. We'll take the alien ship to the nearest star base. Ensign, lay in a course. Captain's log, star date 45212. 1. We delivered the Ktarian vessel to Star base 82 and will rendezvous with the Starship Merrimack which will transport Wesley Crusher back to Starfleet Academy. I never saw you wear these. Afraid someone might see your birthmark? Now, I wonder who started that birthmark rumour. I wish you didn't have to go. Me, too. You'll write, won't you? Somebody has to kill all those rumours. Mr. Crusher, we've rendezvoused with the Merrimack. Please report to transporter room two. On my way, sir. I gotta go. Here. A gift, so you'll remember. Robin's Laws, all 102 of them. Thanks. Law 103? Yes? A couple of light years can't keep good friends apart. Bye. "
S5E07,"Captain's log, star date 45233.1. Our terraforming mission to Doraf I has been cancelled and the Enterprise recalled to Star base 234. Fleet Admiral Brackett would not discuss the matter on subspace for reasons she said would soon be clear. I apologize, Captain, for the mystery, but we must attempt to contain this information at least as long as possible. I must admit you've piqued my curiosity, Admiral. Three weeks ago, one of our most celebrated ambassadors, an adviser to Federation leaders for generations, disappeared. He left no word of his destination. Two days ago, intelligence reports placed him on Romulus. I assure you, it was an unauthorized visit. Computer, initiate linkage with Star base computer system Alpha 29. Linkage complete. A defection? If it is, the damage to Federation security would be immeasurable. Taken on Romulus by long-range scanner. Computer, enhance image in section four delta. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, star date 45236.4. As I study the reports on Spock's disappearance, I cannot help but feel a deeper, more personal concern about this mission, for I know this man through his father. Barely a year ago, I shared a mind-meld with the Vulcan, Sarek. Now we must meet again, as I attempt to find an explanation for his son's actions. We'll reach Vulcan in less than an hour, Captain. Inform Sarek's wife of our plans. It's taken care of. She's transporting over at 0700. And Sarek? He's too ill to make the trip. The man is dying. It's my honour to tell him his son may have betrayed the Federation. How well do you know Spock? I only met him once. What I know is out of history books, and my mind-meld with his father. That covers a lot of ground. Not as much as you'd imagine. Sarek and Spock... Well, sometimes, fathers and sons... Understood. One other thing. Look at this. Turned up in an intelligence sweep. Metal fragments. What do you think? Possibly components, identified as Vulcan. From a Ferengi ship? They were in crates marked ""Medical Supplies"". Contraband. It's been sent to Vulcan for identification. Starfleet have requested that we lend a hand. Mint tea. It's been years since I've had any. Vulcans have some strange concoction they call mint. You'd never recognize it. Perrin, do you know why I've come to Vulcan? I must talk to you about Spock. He didn't even say goodbye to his father before he left. Is it possible he could have been abducted? No! He wrapped up all his affairs carefully. He knew he was going. Do you have any idea why he might have disappeared like this? Captain, as far as I'm concerned, he disappeared a long time ago. Is it inappropriate to ask what happened between you? Not between us. Between Spock and his father. They had argued for years. That was family. But when the debates over the Cardassian War began, he attacked Sarek's position. Publicly. He showed no loyalty for his father. I was not aware Sarek was offended by Spock's opposition. I was offended. I made sure that Spock knew it. I'm very protective of my husband. I do not apologize for it. Does Sarek have any idea why Spock might have left? I don't know. If you could see Sarek as I do, wasting in bed, whispering to himself... He wants to see his son. He wants to heal any rift that may still remain. Now, it may be too late. Perrin, would you allow me to see Sarek? If it were anyone else, I would never permit it. But you are a part of him, and he of you. The Vulcans can't identify the fragments, but they've determined the metal is a dentarium alloy. That indicates they're Vulcan. It also means that whatever this was, it was designed for use in space. From the damage, it was a high-speed impact. A Ferengi ship went down in the Hanolin asteroid belt. Debris covered 100 square kilometers. Is it a weapons array? I thought so. But the Vulcans have no record of stolen weapons or parts. This is going to be like doing a jigsaw puzzle with no idea what the picture should be. Yep. He is like this most of the time. His emotions have taken over. Sometimes, I can bring him out of it. Sarek! You will listen. Go from me. Picard is here. No more chaos! No more. I will leave you alone with him. He will either acknowledge you or he won't. Sarek! I've come a long way to see you. I will not answer. I must talk to you about your son. I wish no one with me. About Spock. Spock? Yes. He's missing. Is that you? Picard? Hello, old friend. You're here, on Vulcan. I need your help. I must find Spock. He's not here. I know. He's been reported on Romulus. Romulus? Yes. Why? I hoped to find that out from you. On Romulus. You're going there, aren't you? To find him. Yes. Do you have any idea what might have taken him to Romulus? No. Is there anyone on Romulus he might know or choose to contact? Pardek? Who is Pardek? It could be Pardek. Who is Pardek? He is a Romulan senator. Spock has maintained a relationship with him. I don't know how they met. At the Khitomer conference, I'd imagine. Pardek represented Romulus? Yes. I'm sure he did. In fact, I recall Spock coming to me with optimism about maintaining a continual dialogue with the Romulans. I told him it was illogical to maintain such an expectation. Spock was always so impressionable. This Romulan, Pardek, had no support at home. Of course, in the end, I was proven correct. I gave Spock the benefit of experience, of logic. He never listened. Never listened. It has been suggested that Spock might have defected. Never. I will accept many things, but never that. But you believe he might have gone to see Pardek? The Romulan senator? How do you know Pardek? I've heard of him. That's what he's done. He's gone to see Pardek. Do you know what business they may have? No, I never knew what Spock was doing. As a boy, he would disappear into the mountains. I would ask what he'd done. He refused to tell me. I insisted that he tell me. He would not. I forbade him to go. He ignored me. I punished him. He endured it, silently. But always he returned to the mountains. One might as well ask the river not to run. But secretly, I admired him, the proud core of him that would not yield. Sarek. We're a part of each other. I know that he has caused you pain. But I also know that you love him. Tell him, Picard. Peace and long life. Live long and... Live long and... Spock. My son. And prosper. Captain's log, star date 45240. 1. To cross the Neutral Zone, I require a cloaked ship. To that end, I have set a course for the Klingon Homeworld. After all we did for Gowron in the recent war, I'm certain he'll be happy to return a favour. Still no reply from the Klingons? No, sir. He's ignoring me. He has to be. After three days, he could find a minute for you. Sir. Yes, Lieutenant? I believe I know why our messages are not being answered. Gowron has been rewriting history. Rewriting history? He is claiming it was his courage, his genius, that ended the civil war. I see. The new version makes no mention of the Federation's help in his rise to power. If Worf's right, we'll be an uncomfortable reminder. He can take all the credit, I don't care. But I do need a ship. If Gowron won't talk to me, get me someone on the High Council. K'tal? Yes, sir. Captain. I have a visual identification of Senator Pardek of Romulus. This is a Barolian record of a trade negotiation in which Pardek participated four years ago. That's all? Yes. Run it again. Computer, freeze. Call up the intelligence scan of Spock on Romulus. Computer, enhance far left figure and compare. Same man. Pardek. One question answered. What do we know of him? He has been in public service since his youth, a senator for nine decades. He is considered a man of the people. He has sponsored many reforms. Reportedly, Romulan leadership considers him to be a radical. He has advocated peace throughout his career. I can see why Spock would cultivate a relationship with him. Where would we find him, other than at the Romulan Senate? He represents the Krocton segment. He maintains a dwelling there. Thank you, Mr. Data. There is more, sir. I took the liberty of expanding my search and found that Pardek has several relatives in the Krocton segment. You can locate him there, on the third day of the week when the Senate is not in session. Mr. Data, your resourcefulness never ceases to amaze me. Thank you, sir. Captain, we are being hailed by the Klingon Homeworld. Gowron or K'tal? Neither, sir. The junior adjutant to the diplomatic delegation. Junior adjutant! Name? B'iJik, sir. On screen. Greetings, Captain. I regret that Gowron and the High Council are too busy to talk to you. Is Gowron aware that we have been transmitting messages for three days? Gowron wishes he could talk with everyone who wants an audience, but the demands on his time are formidable. If you would leave a message? A message? Very well. Tell Gowron, leader of the High Council of the Klingon Empire, that his Arbiter of Succession, Jean-Luc Picard, needs a favour. A favour? I require a cloaked vessel. A cloaked vessel? This is no small favour, Captain. Our mission could have repercussions for the whole quadrant. How would it benefit the Klingon Empire? I'm sure Gowron will ask. The only benefit to the Klingon Empire would be our gratitude. You want me to tell him that? Yes. And please add that if he is unable to provide us with a ship, then I am sure there are others in the Klingon Empire who would be willing to help me. And then, they would have our gratitude. I see. Also, please tell Gowron that I am immensely gratified that he is prospering so well. A tribute to his skilled leadership. They're not removable, are they? Removable? Your ears. No, Doctor. They are fully integrated components. We'll need moulds of his ears. And his skin colour? We'll need some tests on his skin pigmentation. Making it look Romulan won't be difficult. We just have to make sure we can change it back again. Your right eye is .004 higher than your left. Nobody's perfect. But... If you want a proper fit to your prosthetic, trust your tailor. Anything from Gowron? No, sir. But Mr. La Forge has made progress with the metal fragments. These two still have an appointment to have their hairpieces designed. 30 minutes, Number One. What we have is a navigational deflector array. Or what's left of one. Who would want a Vulcan deflector? Beats me. Every question we answer brings up two more. Are you certain it's Vulcan? Metallurgical analysis confirms it. And a molecular pattern trace has identified the ship as T'Pau. Decommissioned years ago and sent to the surplus depot at Qualor II. It's meant to still be there. Worf to Capt Picard. Yes, Lieutenant? A Klingon vessel is decloaking off our port bow, compliments of Gowron. Mr. Worf, convey my gratitude to the Captain and advise him that Mr. Data and I will be transporting over shortly. I'd like to go to Qualor II, sir. See what's out there. Agreed. Thank you, Mr. La Forge. I know my duty, Captain. When I am given orders, I follow them, but I do not like secrets. I want to know why we are going on this mission. I'm sorry. It's a classified matter. You're going after the defector, aren't you? Defector? Do you think information like that stays a secret? Ambassador Spock has gone to Romulus and you are going after him. Captain, your orders are to take us to Romulus and to bring us back. That is all I will discuss. If we are discovered by the Romulans, it means death for us all. I realize that. Very well, Captain. We have set a course for Romulus. It may not be what you're used to on a Starfleet ship. Quite nice. Thank you. Capt K'Vada, is this the Captain's quarters, or my own? Both. We have limited space. We are a military ship, not a pleasure craft. Of course. This will be fine. You will sleep Klingon-style. We do not soften our bodies by putting down a pad. Good! I prefer it that way. You will take meals with us. But we do not serve Federation food. I've been looking forward to gagh. Haven't had it for ages. Very fresh. Well, Captain, we're at the border of the Neutral Zone. You mean to do this, do you? Yes, I do. First Officer's log, star date 45240.6. We are nearing Qualor II, home of a Federation surplus depot operated by the Zakdorn. We hope to find out how the salvaged deflector array ended up in the hands of the Ferengi. I've made contact, Commander. On screen. I'm Cmdr William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Klim Dokachin, Quartermaster, Surplus Depot Z- 15. I need information on a Vulcan ship, the T'Pau. You got it a few years ago. Did you arrange an appointment? An appointment? No. Then I will be unable to help you. You may communicate with Scheduling. Who does he think he is? The Quartermaster of the supply yard, with information you need. Right. Mr. Worf, re-establish communication. Aye, sir. Mr. Dokaychin? Dokachin. Klim Dokachin. Mr. Dokachin, the information I need is of major importance to the Federation. I need access to logs and files. My people can do the work. I don't allow outsiders into my computer system. Alright. One of your people can do the work. I wish I had the people to spare. I don't. Well, sir, what would you suggest? I don't know. Contact me when you reach orbit. I don't believe this! He's king of his particular hill, Commander. You have to treat him that way. Counsellor, this feels like a perfect job for you. Thank you for coming on board, Mr. Dokachin. Quite a ship you have. We're linked to your computer if you could access the files. I don't usually see them in such good condition. By the time they get to me, they're always falling apart. We must find this ship and you're the only one who can help us. Who are you? Deanna Troi, ship's Counsellor. He must figure we don't get to see a lot of handsome women out here, and someone like you might get a little more cooperation from me. He's probably right. What was the name of that ship? The T'Pau? The T'Pau. Vulcan registry. There. Logged in star date 41344. Where's the ship now? Docked. Section 18, gamma 12. Want me to take you there? I'd appreciate it. Helmsman, lay in a heading 141 by 208, ahead slow, 200 kph. I suppose this is your first visit to a junkyard, isn't it? You'd be surprised at some of the things I find on board these ships! I once found a 14-foot Caldorian eel on board a freighter, in someone's locker. Are you serious? If there's time, I'll show it to you. I still have it. Nursed her back to health. We are approaching the coordinates. On screen. What? Where is it? What happened to it? These are the coordinates. The T'Pau is missing? The T'Pau is missing! How can a ship disappear from your depot? I am not used to losing things. I will find your ship for you. The T'Pau is cross-referenced in four directories. When it arrived, was it stripped of armaments, sensors? Of course. Can you tell us what happened to its navigational deflector? It went to the Tripoli, a holding vessel on the rim of the shipyard. It's not there any more. What's left of it is in our cargo bay. How can that be? Maybe we should visit the Tripoli. In all the time that the Zakdorn have operated this depot, nothing has ever been lost. Never. Approaching the coordinates, sir. On screen. I do not understand this. This is not possible! We beam goods to the Tripoli on a regular schedule. We made a shipment yesterday. Another is set for today. It must be there. When is today's transport? Just over two hours from now. A shipment of deuterium storage tanks. Ensign, align the Enterprise like an abandoned ship. Mr. La Forge, when we're in position, shut down the engines and all systems except sensors and life support. Someone will be here to receive those storage tanks. I'd be interested to know who that is. These quarters were intended for one, with but a single sleeping space. I'm sure the Klingons found it amusing to put us here together. Since I do not require sleep, I propose you take the shelf, sir. I am content to stand. Very well, Mr. Data, thank you. Are you comfortable, sir? I suppose so. Goodnight, Captain. Sleep well, sir. Thank you. What are you doing? Sir? Was I making noise, sir? No, not exactly. I was processing the information we accumulated on Romulan society. I am preparing to impersonate a Romulan. I see. Shall I discontinue, sir? No, please, go on. What are you looking at? Nothing, sir. I am organising my files. But you were looking at me. I am sorry if I was disturbing you. I will not look in your direction. Do you not wish to sleep, sir? I don't think so, Mr. Data. Let's go on with the files. I'd be happy to. I have studied the Krocton segment, as asked, and have chosen a site for transport. Capt K'Vada to Picard. Please come to the bridge. Captain. We've monitored a subspace message that might interest you. Sarek is dead. Commander, sensors detect a ship approaching at warp speed. Identification? Negative. No transponder signal, no subspace marker. They don't want to be identified. It's coming out of warp, sir. On screen. Sensors indicate a combat vessel, origin undetermined, heavily armed. Mass and density suggest that it's fully loaded with cargo. From these scans, a good deal of that cargo is weaponry. The ship is entering sector 12, delta 4. He's taking the position assigned to the Tripoli. The coordinates are identical. Readings show surface-to-ship transport has begun. Bring the engines back on line and restore all systems to normal. He's powering up, turning to starboard. Open a channel. Open. This is Cmdr William Riker of the USS Enterprise. Identify yourself. I repeat, you have entered a Federation depot. Identify yourself. The ship is locking phasers. Shields up. Red alert. They easily match our armament. It's coming about. If you do not respond, we will take that as hostile action. There's an energy build-up in their phaser banks. Sir, they're activating weapons. Forward shields at 72 percent. Boost power to the shields. Mr. Worf, lock on to their weapons systems only and prepare to fire. Forward shields down to 68 percent. Aft shields, 40 percent. On my mark, .75 burst. We just want to get their attention. Ready, sir. Fire. Their forward shields are damaged. We destroyed one of their phaser arrays. There's collateral damage in the cargo area. I'm picking up massive power fluctuations, internal explosions. With all those armaments, that ship will blow. Well, Mr. Data, what do you think? I would not have thought it possible, sir. I am eager to test the success of our efforts. It does remain to be seen whether the Romulans will accept us. Captain, you have seemed unusually pensive since we received the news of Ambassador Sarek's death. Sarek and I share a particular bond. Our lives touched in an unusual way. I admit I feel the effects of his death. The tenor of this mission has changed, at least for me. We were sent to confront Spock about his disappearance. Now I also have to tell him that his father is dead. I do not entirely understand, sir. As a Vulcan, Ambassador Spock would simply see death as the logical result of his father's illness. It's never quite that simple, not even for a Vulcan. Certainly not for Spock, who is half-human. Years spent in conflict. And now the chance to resolve those differences is gone. Considering the long life span of Vulcans, it does seem odd they chose not to resolve those differences in the time allowed. Father and son. Both proud, stubborn, more alike than either is prepared to admit. A lifetime spent building emotional barriers. They're very difficult to break down. And now the time has come when it's too late. It's a difficult moment. It's a lonely one. It's a moment that Spock is about to face. Don't you two look sweet? Be careful, Android. Some Romulan beauty might take a liking to you. Lick that paint right off your ears. You! Do you know what the Romulans will do to you if they discover who you are? I have a good idea. We're ready to transport to the surface. Just so we understand each other, my orders don't include rescue missions! Senator Pardek. You received my message. I got here as quickly as I could, Proconsul. What do you know of this human? Jean-Luc Picard, a Starfleet captain. I know nothing of him. You haven't seen him recently? To my knowledge, I have never seen him. I have received intelligence indicating he's on his way here, perhaps here already. Here on Romulus? Yes. Curious, isn't it? We'd better find out if the report is accurate or merely rumour. Circulate his likeness to the security forces. Remind them that he's probably disguised as one of us. I'll see to it. This is the street where the scan of Spock and Pardek was taken, sir. Allowing for distortions, I can verify the architectural features. Where were they standing? Data, you're moving about in a very, well, android way. I am sorry, Captain. I will be more careful. Don't call me Captain. I understand, sir. I have found the place where they were standing. Where? It is here. At this doorway. A legal intercessor's office. The name is similar to Pardek's. It would appear to be a relative. Not open for business yet. Nonetheless, I recommend we keep this location under observation. I determined Pardek's routine. When the Senate is not in session, he invariably comes to this section after the median hour. Very well. Let's sample the local cuisine, shall we? Do you know what time the intercessor's office opens? Why do you want to know? I need his services. He was recommended. I haven't seen you here before. We're here for the day, from the city of Rateg. Rateg? I don't think so! Why do you say that? You don't sound like it. It is a misconception that all Rategs have the same inflection. In fact... We come from several kilometers outside the city. Or from the security forces to watch the intercessor's office? Is he in trouble? You are mistaken, madam. Doesn't matter to me. I don't know when he opens. Eat your soup, courtesy of a loyal establishment. Jolan true. I don't think we can stay here too long. We may not have to. Direct your view to the far corner, sir. Very good, Senator. Senator. We seem to be having some problems... Is that not Pardek? I believe it is. Perhaps you should appear to enjoy your soup, sir. I'll take care of that. Come. Do not move! What? You've made a mistake. Quiet! Come with us. Wait here. What for? What have you brought us here for? Welcome to Romulus, Capt Picard. Don't let our soldiers frighten you. We had to get you off the street as quickly as we could. Romulan Security knows that you're here. I am Pardek. You are among friends, Captain. I have come on an urgent mission from the Federation. I'm looking for Ambassador Spock. Indeed. You have found him, Capt Picard. "
S5E08,"Last time, on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". Three weeks ago, one of our most celebrated ambassadors and adviser to Federation leaders for generations, disappeared. I gave Spock the benefit of experience, of logic. He never listened. It's been suggested that he might have defected. Who'd want a Vulcan shield array? Beats me. Every question we answer brings up two more. Be careful, Android. Some Romulan beauty might take a liking to you. Lick that paint right off your ears. You! Do you know what the Romulans will do to you if they discover who you are? I have a good idea. The ship is locking phasers. Shields up. Red alert. What do you know of this human? Jean-Luc Picard, a Starfleet captain. You've made a mistake. Quiet. Come with us. I have come on an urgent mission from the Federation. I'm looking for Ambassador Spock. You have found him, Capt Picard. And now, the conclusion. What are you doing on Romulus? That was to be my question of you. It is no concern of Starfleet. On the contrary, it is very much Starfleet's concern. You're in a position to compromise Federation security. You may assure your superiors I am on a personal mission of peace, and I will advise Starfleet when appropriate. That is not satisfactory. You cannot remain here, Capt Picard. And I will not return without a full explanation. Ambassador,... ..with great respect for all you have achieved for the Federation, this sort of... cowboy diplomacy will not easily be tolerated any more. Cowboy diplomacy? If you undertake a mission with repercussions for the Federation, you should discuss it with the Federation. I am here as their representative. You'll have to discuss it with me. That is what I had hoped to avoid. I also have the responsibility of being the bearer of unhappy news. Sarek? Sarek is dead? Walk with me, Picard. I know of your mind-meld with my father which enabled him to complete his last mission. It was an honour. He's a great man. He was a great representative of the Vulcan people and of the Federation. I was with him before coming here. He expressed his pride in you. His love. Emotional disarray was a symptom of the illness from which he suffered. No. Those feelings came from his heart. He shared them with me. I know. Sarek would no more approve my coming here than you do, Picard. For some time, I've been aware of a growing movement here of people who seek the ideals of Vulcan philosophy. They've been declared enemies of the State. But a few in the Romulan hierarchy, like Pardek, are sympathetic. He asked me to come now, because he believes it is time for a first step toward reunification. Reunification? After so many centuries, after so many differences have evolved between your peoples? It would seem unlikely to succeed but I cannot ignore the rewards a union between our worlds would bring. What is this first step Pardek suggests? There is a new proconsul in the Romulan Senate. He is young and idealistic. He has promised many reforms. Pardek believes he may be receptive to discussing reunification. Why not bring something so important to the attention of your own people? Or the Federation? A personal decision, Captain. You may be aware of the small role I played in peace with the Klingons. History is aware of your role. Not entirely. It was I who committed Capt Kirk to that peace mission and I bore responsibility for the consequences to him and his crew. Quite simply, I am unwilling to risk any life but my own on this occasion. So I ask that you respect my wishes and leave. Your logic escapes me. If I didn't know better, I'd say that your judgement is influenced by your emotions. You speak as my father would if he were here, Picard. I speak as a Starfleet officer, and I cannot ignore the risks to you. I was involved with cowboy diplomacy, as you describe it, long before you were born. Nevertheless, I'm not prepared to leave until your affairs are complete. In your own way, you are as stubborn as another captain of the Enterprise I once knew. Then I'm in good company, sir. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. We have more important things to do than acting as your nursemaids! Capt Picard regrets detaining you, but it must be for a while longer. In addition, I require access to your ship's computer. Access to our computer? For what purpose? I am going to attempt to penetrate the Romulan information net. Don't bother. We've been trying for years. My unique skills may allow me to succeed. I cannot reveal Klingon entry codes to Starfleet! Your entry codes can easily be reconfigured after we depart. Capt Picard has authorized me to share any information we obtain from the data banks. Anything else? We will need to communicate with the Enterprise in Sector 213. If you do, the Romulans will know our coordinates. Using conventional means, true. I suggest we piggyback our signal on Romulan subspace transmission. Piggyback? A human metaphor, pardon me. We would use a Romulan signal as a carrier for our own, thus disguising its origin. It won't work! I believe it would. During the last hour, I have reviewed the entire Romulan subspace grid. I have compared my findings with your own transmission array. They appear compatible. Thank you for your cooperation. Allow me to brighten your table. Jolan true. The Senate has adjourned. Pardek will be here shortly. How widespread is this movement? There are groups in every populated area. I've spoken to members from four provinces. It is a serious concern for the leadership. Serious enough for the leaders to suddenly embrace a Vulcan peace initiative? l... I have... I have some difficulty in accepting that. I sense you have a closed mind. Closed minds have kept these worlds apart for centuries. In the Federation, we have learned from experience to view Romulans with distrust. We can choose to live with that enmity or seek a way to change it. I choose the latter. I will be first to cheer when the Neutral Zone is abolished. But I wonder if this movement is strong enough to reshape the entire Romulan political landscape. One can begin to reshape the landscape with a single flower. Jolan true, Mr. Spock. Here. Look what I've brought you. This is my friend, D'Tan. He's very curious about Vulcan. Hello, D'Tan. Where did you get this? It's very old. They read to us from it at meetings. It tells the story of the Vulcan separation. D'Tan. Do not bring that out here. You've been told many times. I just wanted to show it to Mr. Spock. Off with you. We'll see you later tonight. Will you tell us more stories about Vulcan? Yes, I will. Jolan true. Perhaps this is not such a good place to talk. So what do you think of your enemy, Capt Picard? These people are no one's enemy, Senator. Many of my colleagues fear what they have to say. But I have learned to listen carefully. Children like D'Tan are our future. Old men like me will not be able to hold on to ancient prejudice and hostility. Young people won't allow it. But now, now that they've met their first real Vulcan, it has only inspired them more. That must be evident to you. I did not anticipate such a passionate response to my arrival. Romulans are passionate. The Vulcans will learn to appreciate that quality in us. If we are successful. We will know soon. The Proconsul has agreed to meet you. First Officer's log, star date 45245. 8. We remain at Qualor II, investigating the theft of a surplus Vulcan ship. The trail has led us to the former wife of a deceased smuggler. A new face. Same one I've always had. And what would you like to hear? Know some blues? Look at me. What do you think? Seven shades of them. How about some Andorian blues? Suck salt? Never cared for it. Good for you. Nasty habit. Who are you looking for? Who says I'm looking for anybody? Your face. Your uniform. In a place like this. OK. I'm looking for you. You just made my day. I have to ask about your husband. Well, it was nice while it lasted. Which husband? The dead one, I'm afraid. You must be from the Enterprise. You destroyed his ship. He was into some bad business. He took the evidence with him. His one endearing quality, he always cleaned up after himself. And what do you want from me? Do you know his business partners? And why should I help you? To be honest, I can't think of a good reason. Well, you did kill my ex-husband, and that's not a bad start. So why don't you drop a few coins in the jar and I'll see what I remember? I don't carry money. Well, you don't offer much, do you? Move over. Just what I need, another set of hands! Know this one? 20th century, Earth. Maybe I can teach you a lick or two. You already have. So what do you say? You around for a couple of days? I can be. Sooner or later a man named Omag will want a song. Always the same thing, Melor Famagal. He's an arms trader. A fat Ferengi. Enter. Proconsul? Yes. Pardek, come in! Ambassador Spock of Vulcan. Proconsul. Please. I've never liked titles, ever since I was a lowly Uhlan in the Romulan Guard. I'm Neral. Well, how is it again? Pardek's tried to show me. I am honoured. Good. Permit me to withdraw. Will you and your wife be at the State dinner? We're looking forward to it. It's years since old Pardek has been invited to an official function. He's too attached to the common man for most people. That is their loss. I find Pardek has unique insight into many issues. Let me tell you, Spock, we're going to start something here, that will redraw the face of the quadrant. Are you prepared to support reunification? I believe it must eventually come. Our two worlds need each other. Forgive me, l... I did not expect to hear a Romulan proconsul speak like a member of your underground. Well,... I want you to know exactly where I stand. Do you believe you can gain the support of your full Senate? Things are not as they were in the Senate. The old leaders have lost the respect of the people. Involvement in the Klingon war, confrontations with the Federation, they're tired of it. Times are changing. Leaders who refuse to change with them will no longer be leaders. Spock,... I am prepared to publicly endorse talks between our peoples. What will Vulcans think of that? They'll be cautious. There are generations of distrust to overcome. But with a man of your influence leading the way... The Senate has been recalled into session. Very well. Can we meet again tomorrow? As you wish. Good. Jolan true, Spock. Live long and prosper. It's everything we could hope for. More than we could hope for. If Neral endorses reunification... He could not become proconsul without support from the traditionalists. True, but... Then how can he endorse reunification when it's considered subversive? Because he's not afraid. He knows we'll support him. Capt Picard is correct. It is not logical for the Proconsul to support reunification now. Why would Neral lie? To expose members of your movement. No. This is our chance for acceptance. Finally to be heard. I believe it's the Federation that fears an alliance. That is not true! I came here to determine the potential for reunification. Despite what has occurred, I intend to continue. I intend to meet with the Proconsul as planned. You let their emotion sway you. No. It is the most logical course. You're as sceptical as I am. Is it logic to ignore good sense? I fear the influence of Sarek has coloured your attitudes toward reunification and perhaps to me. That's the second time you've said I speak with another man's voice. It's true, he will always be a part of me. His experience, his spirit. But I speak with my own voice, not his. Curious,... that I should hear him so clearly, now that he is dead. I may have brought my argument with Sarek to you. If so, I apologize. Is it so important you win one last argument? No. But it is true that I will miss the arguments. They were, finally, all that we had. But your fight with Sarek is over, Spock. You have none with me. I always had a different vision than my father. The ability to see beyond pure logic. He considered it weak. But I have discovered it to be a source of extraordinary strength. Sarek would have seen this mission of reunification as a fool's errand. Somehow I think it is not. Logic cannot explain why, but I know I must pursue this. Even if it leads to a Romulan trap? If the Romulans do have an ulterior motive, it is in the best interests of all that we determine what it is. So, I will play the role that they would have me play. Any success, Mr. Data? Negative, Captain. The Romulans use a progressive encryption lock. I am unable to penetrate their security. May I assist you, Commander? I have experience in these matters. By all means, Ambassador. They have incorporated a 43-part cipher key in their entry sequence. Yes, sir. The 29th is the only one I cannot bypass. I think I'll take this opportunity to remove my ears. He intrigues me, this Picard. In what manner, sir? Remarkably analytical and dispassionate. For a human. I understand why my father chose to mind-meld with him. There's an almost Vulcan quality to the man. Interesting. I had not considered that. And he has been a role model in my quest to be more human. More human? Yes, Ambassador. Fascinating. You have an efficient intellect, superior physical skills, no emotional impediments. Some Vulcans aspire all their lives to achieve what you have by design. You are half-human? Yes. Yet have chosen a Vulcan way of life. I have. In effect, you have abandoned what I have sought all my life. I believe I have isolated the 29th-cipher access code. I shall attempt to access the Proconsul's files. Ambassador Spock, may I ask a personal question? Please. As you examine your life, do you find you have missed your humanity? I have no regrets. ""No regrets."" That is a human expression. Yes. Fascinating. Do you know any Klingon opera? I don't get a lot of requests for it. Surely you must know at least one theme from Aktuh and Melota? I may be a little rusty. Melota Melota. Melota What is that dreadful noise? It sounds like a Bardakian pronghorn moose! You know what I wanna hear! Yes, yes. I know. Worf to Enterprise. Go ahead. A fat Ferengi has just entered the establishment. Is that Melor Famagal I hear? It is. I'm on my way. Where's the waiter? Is there a waiter in this sorry place? Is there a problem? Yes. I need more napkins! Use your sleeve. What did you say?! Or use theirs. I don't care. Who are you? Cmdr William Riker, USS Enterprise. Am I supposed to stand up and salute? We're investigating a missing Vulcan ship. You've got the wrong Ferengi. I never trade in Vulcan ships. We know you're involved. Who'd want a Vulcan ship? Vulcans are pacifists! I deal in warships. Can somebody get me a napkin? Who would want a Vulcan ship? Hypothetically speaking? Hypothetically speaking. I never learned to speak hypothetical! Are you crazy? Here's what'll happen if you don't tell me about the Vulcan ship. Your right of passage will be revoked. More than that, I will be very unhappy. I took it to a Barolian freighter. At what coordinates? I don't remember. You're shrinking my neck! Coordinates? Galorndon Core. Near the Neutral Zone. That's all I know! I swear it. Enjoy your dinner. When I heard a Barolian ship was at Galorndon Core, I thought Romulans. The Romulans are interested in bonding with the Vulcans. Spock has met the new Senate proconsul about reunification. Reunification? The Proconsul says he is prepared to endorse peace talks. And Spock? The Ambassador is sceptical, but cares greatly about reunification. If there's hope of success, he will pursue it. I'm afraid I don't see how a stolen Vulcan ship fits in to all this. Neither do l. How soon can you be at Galorndon Core? A little over eight hours. This may be a wild-goose chase, but I see no other choice. Agreed. We are losing our Romulan carrier wave, sir. We'll advise you further when you reach your destination. Picard out. Ensign, set a course for Galorndon Core, warp eight. Aye, sir. Romulan subspace logs identify a transmission from the Romulan surface to a Barolian ship near Galorndon Core 12 hours ago. Galorndon Core is along the Barolian trade route. They trade a great deal with the Romulans. It's probably routine. This does not appear to be routine. I traced the source of the transmission. It incorporates the code prefix of Romulan intelligence. Can you access it? It is a short sequence of numbers. One, four, zero, zero. Nothing more? No, sir. Spock! I've been looking for you. I was with the Proconsul. Does he still speak of reunification? He speaks of nothing else. Have you ever seen these? The syllabic nucleus of the Vulcan language. My toys from when I was small. Your parents wanted you to understand Vulcan? Yes. As did their parents, to prepare for when we would live again with our Vulcan cousins. Your friends from the Federation have returned. They need you. I told Pardek. He'll meet you in the cave. The only communication sent was the numbers one, four, zero, zero. What does it mean? It means the Proconsul has been attempting to deceive me. Why, I cannot say. His conversations have been part of a greater plan involving the stolen Vulcan ship. How do you know? The time the Proconsul set for announcing our peace initiative is 1400 hours tomorrow. One, four, zero, zero. Why would they need a Vulcan ship? That will become clear very shortly. Capt Picard. Welcome to Romulus. I trust you've enjoyed your visit. And this is the android I've come to respect in battle. Lt Cmdr Data. How could they know this location? Someone betrayed us! Yes. You did. Spock! We've been friends for 80 years. It is the logical conclusion. You asked me here, you set up meetings with the Proconsul. You knew Picard and Data had returned to the surface with new information. The great Spock. Very well. Senator Pardek, your service to the Romulan people is noted and appreciated. Jolan true, Spock. Do not be distressed. Your dream of reunification is not dead. But it will take a different form. The Romulan conquest of Vulcan. Bring them! First Officer's log, supplemental. We are at Galorndon Core, near the Neutral Zone. Any signs of life? Negative, Commander. They may have a cloaked base. Or anywhere in the Neutral Zone. Sir. A coded subspace signal from Romulus. It's the Captain. What? ""Maintain position at Galorndon Core."" ""Diplomatic initiative appears to be succeeding. Will advise."" The message employed the proper coded sequence. Yeah, I'm sure it did. Come in, gentlemen. Take a seat, please. Excuse me, I'm finishing a speech. For you, Mr. Spock. I enjoy writing. I don't do it often in this job. Maybe you would be happier in another job. Feel free to change any words. I've tried to make it sound Vulcan. A lot of unnecessarily long words. In a few hours, you will deliver this statement with our proconsul. It will announce that a peace envoy is on its way from Romulus. We will transmit it on all Federation frequencies. Peace envoy. A stolen Vulcan ship. Three Vulcan ships. The Enterprise is only aware of the one we stole from Qualor II. We followed their investigation. It has forced us to make changes. One of them, a message from you ordering them to stay where they are. If Vulcan ships enter the Neutral Zone, the Enterprise will intercept. The Enterprise will be given more important matters. Meanwhile, Spock will tell his people to welcome the peace envoy. When they do, our forces will seize control before anyone realizes. Do you seriously believe the Federation will not intervene? Of course it will, and we're fully prepared. But we will be there, entrenched. And it will be very difficult to get us out once we are. Reunification will become a fact of life. I will not read this, or any other statement. If you do not, you will die, all of you. Since it is logical to conclude you will kill us in any event, I choose not to cooperate. I hate Vulcans. I hate the logic. I hate the arrogance. Very well. Computer, holographic program, Spock One. By using holographic sampling, we have created a programmable Spock. Run program. This is Ambassador Spock of Vulcan. By now, Federation sensors are tracking three Vulcan ships crossing the Neutral Zone. These ships carry the future of the Romulan and Vulcan people. Our long conflict is finally over. Freeze. We would prefer an interactive Spock, who could take questions, but this will have to suffice. This will not convince anyone. I don't need to convince them, just confuse them long enough to reach Vulcan. End program. It's time to send our ships on their journey. Suggestions. Cmdr Data, are they still unaware we have access to their computers? I believe so. Perhaps we can find a way to create a diversion. Sensors are picking up three vessels crossing the Neutral Zone. Vulcan ships. Vulcan? What's the heading, Mr. Worf? 143, mark 012. That would put them on a course to Vulcan. They're in no hurry. They're only moving at warp one. Worf, signal them on subspace. Request their status. Geordi, see if it's one of the ships that we've been looking for. They say they're escorting a peace envoy to Vulcan. They request we monitor Federation channels. Spock will make an announcement soon. Maybe the talks were successful. Geordi? None of the transponder signatures matches the missing ship. They could have been altered. I'll keep checking. Set a course to intercept. Sir, the Captain's orders... I know his orders, Lieutenant. Engage. Impossible! There's no way they could have gotten out! That's far enough. Stay where you are. Drop your weapons. How did you get in here? Drop your weapons. Drop your weapons. Cease fire. Holograms. I'm afraid I don't know too much about Romulan disruptor settings. Cowboy diplomacy? Well done, Mr. Data. Though... ..l don't think you got Cmdr Riker's hair quite right. I will be more observant in future, sir. Spock's announcement will be made in minutes. Our forces will be on Vulcan before you can act. We've had a priority-one distress call from the colony on Dulisian IV. A failure of environmental support systems. They'll require evacuation. Mr. Worf, any other ships in the vicinity of Dulisian IV? One, sir. An archaeological vessel. It's not equipped to handle something of this scale. Any update on the Vulcan ships? I checked every sensor display. If the Romulans altered them, they didn't leave fingerprints. The ships have entered Federation space, at low warp. Lay in a new course to Dulisian IV. Incoming message from Romulus, on all channels. On screen. This is Ambassador Spock of Vulcan. Federation sensors are tracking three Vulcan ships in the Neutral Zone. These ships carry a Romulan invasion force and must be stopped. I repeat, these ships carry a Romulan... Contact Dulisian IV. Confirm the distress call. I feel it may be a false alarm. Mr. Worf, how long until we intercept the Vulcan ships? 14 minutes, sir. Communication terminated, but I am certain the message was sent first. Well done, Mr. Data. You won't get out of here! I disagree. After studying the designs of this structure, I determine our best escape route is the underground exit to the east. I have disconnected certain security scanners to assist us. We cannot allow you to warn your guards. Not bad. Vulcan defences are responding. The Romulan force is retreating to the Neutral Zone. They're not taking those ships home! Visual range, Commander. On screen. Romulan war bird decloaking alongside. Red alert. Tell the war bird to withdraw, leaving the Vulcan ships where they are. The war bird is powering up its disruptor array. Ready phasers. There were 2,000 Romulan troops on board those ships. They destroyed their own invasion force. Rather than let them be taken prisoner. Stand down red alert. Mr. Worf, advise the Klingon ship to signal us when Capt Picard and Data are on board. Aye, sir. This way. Pardek never saw these caves. It's safe. They won't find us. What will you do now? What we have always done. Continue to teach. Pass on the ideals to a new generation. Work for the day when new thoughts may be spoken aloud. The Federation will welcome that day. Captain, we must reach our transport site in 14 minutes. I wish you well. Thank you, Captain. Captain, I will not be coming with you. Ambassador... The reason for my coming here was never more clear. The union of the Vulcan and Romulan people will not be achieved by politics or diplomacy, but it will be achieved. The answer has been here before us all along. An inexorable evolution toward a Vulcan philosophy has begun. Like the first Vulcans, these people are struggling toward enlightenment. It may take decades, even centuries, for them to reach it, but they will reach it. And I must help. I know it is useless to argue with you once your mind is set. Not at all, Captain. I have found our arguments quite useful. Almost as useful as those I had with my father. Would it surprise you to learn that he found them equally valuable? Ironically,... ..you may know Sarek better than his own son does. My father and I never chose to meld. I offer you the chance to touch what he shared with me. "
S5E09,"Captain's log, star date 45349.1. The Enterprise is on its way to Penthara IV. A type-C asteroid has struck an unpopulated continent. The resulting dust cloud could create a phenomenon like the nuclear winters of 21st-century Earth. Cmdr La Forge has begun work on a plan that would counteract the devastation. I'm afraid the numbers indicate climatic changes. What drop can we expect? The Pentharans predict ten to 12 degrees Celsius within ten days. Their ecosystem will be shot to hell. I doubt they're prepared to cope with the cold. Cmdr Riker. Yes, sir? Join me on the bridge, please. Right away. Are you certain? There was a space-time distortion. Something is there. We passed within 300 kilometers. Too close to be a coincidence. Mr. La Forge, would a delay of one hour affect your plans? Not unless another asteroid hits Penthara, sir. The odds of that occurring are extremely unlikely. Thank you, Mr. Data. Let's look at Mr. Worf's distortion. Aye, sir. Mr. Worf's what? Sensors detected a temporal distortion almost in our course. There's a small object that wasn't there before. It's 50 kilometers ahead, sir. Full stop. Aye, sir. On screen. Dimensions, Worf? Approximately five metres long, sir. Life signs? No signs of any kind. Our sensors do not penetrate the hull. Try hailing it. That's odd. What's odd? We've received a response, but... Yes, Mr. Worf? They want you to move over, sir. Reply that the Enterprise isn't going anywhere. Not the Enterprise, Captain. You. What are you trying to tell me? Excuse me, but you were standing right where I needed to be. Who are you? Rasmussen's the name, sir. Professor Berlinghoff Rasmussen. This is wonderful! Actually, quite a bit larger than I thought. Really? Where I come from, every historian knows the bridge of old 1701-D! Where exactly do you come from? Why, Earth. Late 26th-century Earth, to be exact. I've travelled back nearly 300 years just to find you. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Exactly what kind of historian are you? My focus is on the 22nd through the 24th centuries. Early interstellar history. It was always believed this was on your desk, not here. Fascinating! Don't move it on my account! You can't expect me to believe that the layout of my ready room can be of interest to future historians. No less so than your legendary modesty, Captain. If I could describe to you what a thrill it is to be here! This is the original. You flatter me, Professor. But I can't help but wonder what could possibly have caused you to select me as a subject for study. Even in this decade, there are far wiser humans in and out of Starfleet. I'd love to tell you, I would. But imagine what a young Caesar might have done differently had someone given him a hint of what lay ahead, or if Lincoln had been coerced into changing his theatre plans! I wish I could be more specific on why you were selected, but I'm afraid the exchange of information will have to flow in one direction only. Five, six, seven metres. I was right. Why now? Right. If you've come to study us and the Captain, why today? Why not a year ago or a year from now? I picked the right day. Just wait. You'll see. Do you always sit there, on that side of the table? Usually. Why? It's not important. At what point does time travel become a tool for historians? Now, now, Commander, you know better than that. I've studied a great deal about your century. You are all aware of the dangers of altering the past. That's what I'd be doing if it were to divulge information like that. Telurian plague. I beg your pardon? The Telurian plague, was it cured? Did they find the cure by your century? Surely I can ask that. It's difficult, but we must keep to ourselves questions about the future. Go on, Professor. I'll prepare questionnaires. Complete them when you can. If you're concerned about a breach of security, I'm sure your captain can make a determination. And thank you in advance for curbing your curiosity. If I hand it in on time, can I get a glimpse of next week's poker game? Mr. Data, escort the Professor to his quarters. This way, sir. What did he mean, he picked the right day? You know everything I do. Deanna? It's hard to tell, but he is holding something back. Of course he is. All the things he could tell us. It might be that. I don't know. What if he's an impostor? We've seen enough of them. He is human. Medical scans prove that. He's human, alright. There was a temporal distortion, Mr. Worf? Yes, sir. No one can deny that his ship is unlike anything we've ever seen. The hull is made of a plasticized tritanium mesh. We've nothing like it on record. Mr. Worf, I do appreciate your caution. I share it. Bring his vessel into the shuttle bay. Place it under guard. Yes, sir. I realize that this visit is going to be difficult for some of us, but his credentials seem to be in order, so we should extend to him every courtesy. Including questionnaires? Including questionnaires, Mr. Worf. This is really a thrill, like running across a Red stone missile or a Gutenberg Bible. To think, the Model T of androids. If you mean the first production-model automobile of the 20th century, the Model A would be a more apt analogy, since I am Dr Soong's revised prototype. I stand corrected. Is there a problem? I suppose it'll have to do, for now. I'll get you a list of the things I'll be needing, OK? Would I be correct in assuming that you know whether or not I am still alive in the 26th century? Since you seem to know so much about the ship, I assumed... It'd be best if you kept your assumptions to yourself, wouldn't it? Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Captain's log, star date 45350.3. We have arrived at Penthara IV and can see for ourselves the atmospheric devastation caused by the asteroid's impact. We've located underground pockets of carbon dioxide here, here and here. Our drilling phasers can release enough of the gas to form an envelope to temporarily hold in the heat of the sun. We've spent years trying to avoid anything that would lead to a greenhouse effect, and now we're about to create one on purpose! Less than 20 percent of normal sunlight is getting through. If we can hold enough heat in, that should give the planet time to mend. Excuse me, Dr Moseley? What now? New Seattle reports a cloud depth of 12 kilometers. Two tropical rivers are freezing. Let's start, before there's nothing left to mend. Look who's here. I hate questionnaires. Professor! Come and join us. Hope I'm not intruding. Not at all. You're the topic of conversation at every table here. As I promised, here are your assignments. I'm sure they're painless. Please try and complete them by tomorrow. Tomorrow? No problem, Professor. You're all very calm. Any reason we shouldn't be? History always records what people were doing when important events took place. But it rarely remembers their activities a week before, a day or even an hour. Are you suggesting an important event is imminent? I didn't say that. Go on doing what you're doing and pretend I'm not here. Why is there no record of other historians travelling back to witness events? We're obviously very careful. In fact, a colleague and I recently paid a call on a 22nd-century vessel. They hadn't perfected quarantine fields. You saw surgical masks? Isn't it fascinating how everyone has different interests when it comes to history? Different perspectives on progress. Would you tell me what that is? Just checking the time. Is something important supposed to be happening? No, it's nothing. What about you? What do you see as the most important example of progress in the last 200 years? I suppose the warp coil. Before there was warp drive, humans were confined to one sector of the galaxy. Spoken like the consummate explorer! What is going on? Are you expecting someone? Phasers. I beg your pardon? There were no phasers in the 22nd century. See? Our Klingon friend is a perfect example of what I was telling you. He views history through the eyes of a hunter. A warrior. His passion lies in the perfection of the tools of violence. How delightfully primitive! When we input this data, the computer should tell us how many holes to punch. How is tectonic stability? Couldn't be better. Scans were all clear. There hasn't been a quiver in a century. Just the two I'm looking for. I brought you the forms. Shouldn't take more than a few hours. We're busy. Tomorrow would be better. Data, we've got 23,000 thermal simulations. Could you check for anomalies? Certainly. Is that as fast as he can go? Not fast enough for you? There's little known about Data's efficiency. Almost nothing about his part in this mission. It's a topic of great conjecture. 209 anomalies, all within acceptable parameters. Thanks, Data. You're here to witness this mission. That's it, isn't it? It'd be best if you thought of me as a fly on the wall and went about your business. I will have your answered questions soon. Data at Penthara IV! If you'll excuse me. Your prosthesis, what do you call it again? A visor. Visor. Right. A visor. I have a picture of you wearing that. How do you like it? It allows me to see. I like it just fine. You know, Homer was blind. Milton, Bach, Monet, Wonder. A fly on the wall, huh? Fly on the wall. The computer has configured the drilling patterns. Captain, I'm ready to transport down. I'll notify Dr Moseley. Good luck, Geordi. Gentlemen. Who said these moments are less exciting when you know the outcome? I know of no one who said that. Enterprise will monitor the CO2 concentrations at six altitudes. If all goes well, it should take only 20 bore sites. Let's hope all goes well. La Forge to Cmdr Riker. How are you doing? The monitoring stations are on line. We're ready when you are. Excellent. All we need now is an open channel to Data. Open a channel, Mr. Worf, and prepare to fire. The computer has locked in the phaser-depth calculations. Mr. Data? Ready, sir. Fire. Target one is emitting 2,000 cubic metres per second. Target two, 1,600. Surface wind patterns are stable. Anything at altitude, Data? CO2 concentrations remain unchanged at upper elevations. Have I missed much? Target 14 complete, sir. Data? What have you got? No change, sir. How are the surface winds, Geordi? Holding steady, sir. The computer has stopped drilling. You should be getting something now, Data. Elevated CO2 levels at 20 kilometers, sir. Now you're talking. We've got new temperatures. All stations report no further temperature drops. Correction, two equatorial stations report slight increases. Thank you, all. You've given us what we need. Time. We're glad to be of help. We will continue to monitor your progress. Picard out. ""You've given us what we need. Time."" Return to synchronous orbit. Aye, sir. Very clever, Picard. Well done! We always knew how you did it, but to experience the moment, to witness the nuances, it's indescribable. He's after more than a history lesson. What are you getting from him? I don't know. It's like he's trying to confuse us, misdirect us somehow. There you are! Well, that certainly was exciting, wasn't it? Is everything alright? Are you well? Yes. Couldn't be better. I thought we might chat about your questionnaire. Buck up, Crewman! You're a credit to that uniform! I've got things to do. No, please, Counsellor. I'd appreciate your remaining. Doctor, in response to question six, you spoke of a neural stimulator. May I see one? I don't see why not. Give me a minute. You don't like me very much. I don't dislike you, Professor. Keep your eyes wide, soldier. You'll tell your grandchildren you were at Penthara IV. But you don't trust me. You should. Should l? ""Picard's empath won't trust you,"" they said. Picard's empath? We're not that unalike, you and l. You possess a sense that is foreign to the others. My knowledge of the future is similar. Some of my best friends are empaths. They trust me. Why should you care if I trust you or not? We're birds of a feather. We're colleagues. We could learn a lot from each other. You're right. I don't trust you. I knew you'd say that. I'm sure you did. Well, I'm glad you two are finally getting along. I really have to be going. Thank you. Why not try a berylite scan? I'd be interested to see what his micro-levels are. So, what else can I show you? You're a very curious woman. No, I don't mean curious like that. I mean, you're curious about things, about berylite levels, about the future. Well, curiosity is why all of us are out here, isn't it? I understand. But you're different, you're more vibrant. More... More vibrant. That's nice. I like that. Whenever I travel back, I meet very interesting people, men and women. But I've never met anyone who gave me thoughts about not going home. You're not supposed to be influencing the past, remember? And I am beginning to feel just a little bit influenced. Anyway, I could be your great-great-great-great-grandmother. What kind of questions did he ask? He only asked about previous starships, what was innovative about the last Enterprise. He wanted to see if we had a grasp of the fundamentals. His questions to me were on Dr Soong's... I am detecting a massive earthquake. Two earthquakes. Location? Both are beneath the southern drill sites. Is La Forge there? Yes, sir. Find him. We've got volcanic activity. Pretty severe. Magnify. La Forge here. Moseley and I are on our way to his lab. Are you alright? We're OK, but those were pretty big. If this was Earth, I'd say 8.5 on the Richter scale. We're starting to see some volcanic plumes. Two more eruptions. We probably overestimated geologic stability around the CO2 pockets. We're in the lab, sir. On screen. We're fairly quake-proof. It's the volcanic dust I'm worried about. What about the dust? The ash from the volcanoes will compound the existing problem. Soon, no sunlight will get through. No amount of CO2 will help us then. Captain, take a look at this. These are the coordinates of the eruptions. And these are the coordinates of the phaser-drilling sites. The mantle is collapsing where the pressure was released. We have some ideas, but it will take time to sort them out. Sort them out, Geordi. Aye, sir. We came here to help these people. And look what we've done. What in God's name is that? Music, Professor. Music? Yes, sir. Mozart's Jupiter Symphony in C major, Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No.3, Beethoven's 9th Symphony, second movement, molto vivace, and La donna é mobile from Verdi's Rigoletto. Could you thin it out a bit? Computer, eliminate program one. Computer, eliminate program two. Computer, eliminate program three. Computer, half-volume. How the...? How can you listen to four pieces of music at the same time? I can distinguish over 150 simultaneous compositions. In order to analyze the aesthetics, I try to keep it to ten or less. Only four today? I am assisting Cmdr La Forge with a complex calculation. It demands a great deal of concentration. I came to thank you for answering my questions. I should have asked you to limit yourself to 50,000 words. You did ask me to be thorough. I know it's hard to believe, but few records of Dr Soong's work survived to the 26th century. So it would be invaluable to myself, and other historians, if you could provide us with some schematics. Certainly. Once my work here is completed. As long as it's before 0900 tomorrow. That's when I head back. Bridge to Data. Yes, Worf? Cmdr La Forge is hailing you from the surface. Patch him through, please. Have you rerun the phase-reversal figures? There were no errors. The variance must be no more than .06 terawatts. I see no other choice. We'll continue to run the numbers but I doubt we'll find anything different. Tell the Captain the good news and the bad news. La Forge out. Which do you suppose he's gonna want to hear first? The good news. The motion of the dust has created electrostatic energy in the upper atmosphere. With a modified phaser blast, we can create a shock front to ionize the particles. That would be like a spark in a gas-filled room. With one exception. The particles would turn into high-energy plasma which our shields could absorb and redirect into space. Turn the ship into a lightning rod? Precisely, sir. The bad news? If our phaser discharge is off by just .06 terawatts, it would cause a cascading exothermal inversion. Meaning? We would completely burn off the atmosphere. Captain's log, supplemental. While Dr Moseley takes La Forge's plan to the colony, I am weighing the consequences of a more philosophical issue. Come. You know why I've asked you here. Yeah, I have a fairly good idea. I'm faced with a dilemma. A planet beneath us is slowly turning to ice. Unless we do something about it, in a matter of weeks, thousands, maybe tens of thousands, will die. That'd be a shame. Yes, it would. It would be quite a shame. So, what's your dilemma? Cmdr La Forge has a possible solution. The margins of error are extremely critical, but if successful, there'll be no more threat. And if it's not successful? Every living thing will perish. So, do nothing, and thousands will die. Do something and millions could die. That's a tough choice. Not if you were to help me. You're not suggesting I tell you the outcome? Oh, no. I am not. Everything I have ever believed in tells me I cannot ask you that. But, at the same time, there are 20 million lives down there. And you know what happened to them. What will happen to them. So, it seems you have another dilemma. One that questions your convictions. I've never been afraid of re-evaluating my convictions. Now, I have 20 million reasons to do so. And why did you ask to see me? Because your presence gives me a potential access to a kind of information that I've never had before. And if I am to re-examine my beliefs, then I must take advantage of every possible asset. It would be irresponsible not to ask you here. However you come to terms with your beliefs, I'm quite comfortable with mine. How can you be? How can you be comfortable watching people die? Let me put it to you this way. If I were to tell you that none of them died, you'd conclude that you tried and succeeded. So you'd confidently try again. No harm in that. But what if I were to tell you they all died? You'd decide not to make the same mistake twice. What if one of the people grew up... I know! What if one of those lives I saved as a child grows up to be the next Adolf Hitler or Khan Singh? Every philosophy student has been asked that since wormholes were discovered. But this is not a class in temporal logic! It's not theoretical or hypothetical. It's real! Surely you see that? All too well. But you must see that if I were to influence you, everything in this sector, in this quadrant, could change. History, my history, would unfold in a way other than it already has. What possible incentive could anyone offer me to allow that to happen? I have two choices. Either way, one version of history or another will wend its way forward. The history you know or another. Who is to say which is better? What I do know is that here, today, one way, millions of lives could be saved. Isn't that incentive enough? Everyone dies, Captain. It's just a question of when. All those people died years before I was born. All of you up here as well. I can't get quite as worked up as you over the fate of some colonists who, for me, have been dead a very, very long time. You know of the Prime Directive, which tells us we have no right to interfere in the natural evolution of alien worlds. I have sworn to uphold it. But, nevertheless, I have disregarded that directive, on more than one occasion, because I thought it was the right thing to do! Now, if you are holding on to some temporal equivalent of that directive, then isn't it possible that you have an occasion here to make an exception, to help me choose, because it's the right thing to do? It's not just a choice. You're trying to manipulate the future. Every choice we make allows us to manipulate the future. Do I invite Adrienne or Suzanne to the spring dance? Do I holiday on Corsica or Risa? A person's life, their future, hinges on each of a thousand choices. Living is making choices! You ask me to believe that if I make a choice other than the one in your history books, then your past will be irrevocably altered. Well, you know, Professor, perhaps I don't give a damn about your past because your past is my future and as far as I'm concerned, it hasn't been written yet! The electrostatic conditions are about as good as they'll get. If we're going to try this, now's the time. Please don't ask me, Captain. I can't help you. I'm sorry. How long to program the phasers? We've just got to tie in to Geordi's sensors. So you made your choice, without my help. On the contrary, you were quite helpful. How's that? By refusing to help, you left me with the choice I had to begin with. To try or not to try, to take a risk or to play it safe. Your arguments have reminded me how precious the right to choose is. And because I've never been one to play it safe,... ..l choose to try. Program the firing sequence. Aye, sir. Captain's log, star date 45351.9. Dr Moseley has met with the colony leaders who are all willing to take the risk. Warp power has been rerouted from the deflector dish. Keep the phasers on active surge control. We get one shot at this. Well, this is it! Is the sequence locked in? Yes, sir. After an 8.3-second burst, we will discharge all EPS taps through the phasers. Time to return, Mr. La Forge. Mr. O'Brien, stand by. I can be more help here. We'll have to compensate for density variations. Dr Moseley's computers can accomplish that task, but Geordi would be better able to anticipate variances. You know there's no guarantee this will work. If it fails... There's no guarantee it will fail, Captain. I'd like your permission to remain here. Permission granted. La Forge remained below. Good luck, Commander. Thank you. The deflector dish has been reconfigured, sir. Proceed, Mr. Data. Stand by for auto-phaser interlock. Activating deflector beam. EPS taps on line. Phasers firing. Activating shield inverters now. Mr. La Forge? La Forge here. Still breathing, Captain. We've got particulate levels right where they should be and the sun is shining! See? I told you there was nothing to worry about. Report back when you're ready. Doctor, we'll analyze the remaining volcanic disturbances, but the best advice would be to let them cool down on their own. I'm getting in the habit of thanking you, Picard. Well, I'd love to see more, but it's nearly time to go. I am tickled pink to have had the opportunity of witnessing this. And you did it all without any help. Well, must run. Got some packing to do. You know you're taller in person, Commander. Look at this! Who would have expected a teary farewell? We have to look inside your vessel. Curious till the end, Captain? You can't be serious. We've been through this. Some objects have gone missing. If they're in your possession, we would like them returned. I'm not here in search of relics! I'm sure they'll turn up. If you will not open the vessel, I will, with explosives if necessary. I doubt you have the means. If we don't get in there, I guarantee you don't either. Considering the sensitive nature of my equipment, you'll understand if I request that only Mr. Data be allowed to see it. Why Data? Because if I order Data never to divulge what he sees, he won't, except anything that might belong to us. Understood, sir. Back in a minute. None of these items belong to you. Nor does this. This phaser is set at the highest stun setting. If I'm correct, that is sufficient to immobilize even you. Why have you stolen these objects? For a museum? Far too valuable for that. In the century I come from, they haven't been invented. But this vessel, the temporal distortion on your arrival. This is a time pod and it is from the 26th century. At least, that's what the poor fella said. He travelled back to the 22nd century, that's my time, and had the misfortune to meet me. His clothes fit quite well. It took me weeks to figure out how to work this thing. You are not an historian? More of an inventor. Until recently, a dismally unsuccessful one. What are your intentions? Thanks to your captain, it seems they have changed slightly. I was quite content to return with these trinkets. I'd invent about one a year. But now, look what fortune has graced me with! You will take longer to figure out than a tricorder, but it should be well worth it. If the auto-timer is programmed the way I think it is, in about two minutes, we should be on our way back to a place called New Jersey. I'm afraid you won't be awake for the ride. I assume your hand print will open this door whether you are conscious or not. That weapon was working yesterday. You were right to suspect him. But he is not from the future. He is from the past. Trying to make my history unfold in a way other than it already has? This was all a misunderstanding. Let me back in. We'll forget the whole thing. What possible incentive could I have to allow that? You will find all the missing items in the vessel. Doctor. Very nice performance. Not all of it. Some of it was real. Captain. He claims to be a 22nd-century inventor, Captain. If you were more inventive and fewer things had disappeared, we wouldn't have suspected. The stumbling block was your ship. Our sensors couldn't penetrate it. Once the door was open, the computer was able to detect and deactivate everything you'd stolen, including this. I'd love to hear more, but I must get back in that pod. Take him to a detention cell, Mr. Worf. Notify Starfleet that we will drop him off at Star base 214. You can't do this. I've got to get back. I don't belong here! No! I'm sure there are more than a few legitimate historians at Starfleet who will be eager to meet a human from your era. Professor? Welcome to the 24th century. "
S5E10,"Captain's log, star date 45376.3. We are approaching the planet Bilana III, where a new method of propulsion, the soliton wave, is being developed. The Enterprise has been asked to take part in one of the first tests of this new technology. Data! Data, isn't this exciting? We are going to witness a moment in history. Every nanosecond is a moment in history, once it has elapsed. No, we're gonna see something that people will talk about for years. Think about it. No more bulky warp engines or nacelles. A ship just generates a soliton wave and rides it like a surfboard. It will be like watching Chuck Yeager break the sound barrier, or Zefram Cochrane engage the first warp drive! It should be interesting. Very exciting. I'm talking to the wrong crowd. Donaldson! You're an engineer... Lt Worf, you have a subspace communication from the transport ship Milan. Transfer the signal to this station. Hello, Worf. Mother. I hope you don't mind us dropping in like this, but when I heard the Enterprise was to be in this sector we took the first transport and here we are. Is Father with you? No, but I brought Alexander with me. I thought the two of you would like a chance to visit. Very well, I will arrange for you to come aboard. Good. Worf! Worf. So good to see you. You look wonderful. Is that a touch of grey in your beard? Don't worry, Rozhenko men have always had beards of iron grey. Hello, Alexander. Hello. It's good to see you both. How long can you stay? I'm not going back. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Did you see Alexander's face when he saw the play area? He'll love it here. Mother, why does Alexander believe he is remaining? A Lapsang Souchong tea, please. Are you eating? You look thin. Mother! When your father was in Starfleet I made sure l... Mother. We need to talk about Alexander. Alexander is a fine boy, Worf. He's smart and high-spirited. Like you were at that age. Sometimes he runs through the house and knocks over that green lamp, like you used to. I don't remember you smiling when I knocked over that lamp. Well, maybe once, when you weren't looking. When we heard Alexander was to come to live with us, we were so happy. The house had been so empty since you left, we thought here is our chance to fill it with the sound of children again. But the truth is, Worf, your father and l, we're getting old. Mother, you both have many years. I don't mean we're ready for the grave. Not yet anyway. But... ..we're a little less active. It's harder for us to keep up with Alexander. We're ready to be just grandparents. Alexander needs to be with his father, Worf. Mother, that is not possible. We must find another option. He needs his father, Worf. Alexander is... He's having difficulties. Difficulties? He's disobedient. Mother, Klingon children are often difficult to control. I do know something about how Klingon children behave! It's not just his willful attitude. He doesn't always tell the truth. My son is a liar? He is a boy, Worf. Boys sometimes take the wrong path. They need guidance. He needs a father, his father, to give him that guidance. I have to leave soon. The transport will be leaving for Earth. You must do what you think is best for him. That's all a parent can hope to do. Did you enjoy going to school on Earth? Yes. Did you like your teachers? Yes. Good. I understand you lived in my old room. Good. Come in. Lt Worf. Very nice to see you again. And you must be Alexander. You'll be coming to school with us. Well, we're very excited to have you with us. The other boys and girls will be happy to have a new classmate. First I need to get some information from you. Let's start with... your name. Alexander Rozhenko. That's a tough one. Maybe you can help me with that. Can you spell your last name for me? Alexander. The teacher asked you a question. It doesn't matter. I think I can figure it out. Date of birth? The 43rd day of Maktag, star date 43205. Yes. Yes, of course. I'll get his personal records from the school on Earth. One last question. How long will he be staying aboard ship? It has not been decided. Come. I thought our meeting was scheduled for 1100 hours. I apologize for being late, Captain, I was detained in school. I was enrolling my son in class. I see. Well, as you are aware, several new security officers will transfer here next week... Kyle to Lt Worf. Worf here. Sorry, but I forgot to mention that we need to arrange placement examinations for Alexander. If you can... This is not a good time. I will contact you shortly, Miss Kyle. Sorry, Captain. I would like to discuss the specific areas of security... Sickbay to Worf. Yes, Doctor? I need to schedule a physical examination for Alexander. I need his medical records and... I would rather discuss this later. There's no rush. Crusher, out. Mr. Worf. You are not the first officer on this ship to have a new family member. Take care of your son. The security matters can wait. Thank you, Captain. 23 field coils working in concert will generate the soliton wave from this point on the planet's surface. We will have our test ship towed to a position approximately two million kilometres from Bilana III. If our theories are correct, the wave will envelop the ship and push it into warp. Warp without warp drive. You'll be out of a job, Geordi. I hope so, Commander. How closely will we need to follow the test vehicle? The soliton emits a great deal of subspace radio interference. You need to be within 20 kilometres in order to receive telemetry. How will you end the experiment? The wave will be directed toward Lemma II, about three light years' distance. Our sister facility there will create a scattering field to dissipate the wave and bring the ship out of warp. I'll send you more detailed operational plans within the hour. Very well. We'll contact you when we've studied the mission specs. Worf. I was talking to Mrs. Kyle, the primary-school teacher. She says you enrolled Alexander in her class. Yes. I'm sure he'll do very well. She's a wonderful teacher. Good. You know about the father/son field trip? Yes. We cannot attend. Why not? I have a personnel review scheduled at 1300 hours. This would be a good opportunity to meet the other students and parents. I might be able to reschedule the review. Good. I'll let them know you're coming. As the value of their horns increased, the number of white rhinos in the wild kept falling, until they finally became extinct about two centuries ago. Now I'll show you a pair of animals we're trying to save from extinction. Would you follow me? They're from Corvan II, where their homes in the rainforests are threatened by industrial pollutants. They're called Corvan gilvos. Well, they're a little shy. The eating habits of the gilvos are very similar to those of Earth's Draco lizards, which died out over 300 years ago. There are only 14 gilvos left on Corvan II. We're taking these two to the protected planet Brentalia, where they should thrive. Well, why don't you all have a look around on your own for a while? If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. Alexander, I'm sorry. I forgot say the models on the tables were for everyone to play with. So I guess you didn't know not to take them. I saw you playing with the lizard model a while ago. Do you still have it? Are you accusing him of stealing? Lt Worf I can only tell you... Alexander. Did you take the model from the table? No, sir. Lieutenant, I saw Alexander put the model inside his jacket. Lt Worf, personal log, star date 45376. 8. Alexander has acted shamefully. As his father I must deal with him. But I find I would rather fight ten Balduk warriors than face one child. A Klingon's honour is more important to him than his life. A Klingon would gladly face the most horrible punishment rather than bring shame or disgrace to his family name. His word is his bond. Without it, he is nothing. Do you understand? Why did you lie to me? I don't know. Did you fear the punishment you would receive? I don't know. You don't know why you lied, yet you did! You don't know why you stole, yet you did! Alexander, come here. When I was a child, younger than you, I lost my parents, my family, my people. Everything I had was taken from me, except my sense of honour. It was the one thing I had that was truly Klingon, which no one could take away. Do you know who they are? Kahless? And his brother Morath. They fought for 12 days and 12 nights, because Morath had broken his word and brought shame to his family. When you lie or steal, you not only dishonour yourself, but your family. You dishonour me. I'm sorry, Father. I won't do it ever again, I promise. I accept your word. We will not speak of this again. Worf! Counsellor. I wanted to know how the field trip went yesterday. You have not heard? No. Why? Bridge. There was an... incident. Alexander stole a small model, then told a falsehood. But I have remedied the situation. May I ask how? I pointed out his error, told him about Kahless and Morath, and explained the value of honour. The boy understood. I see. Sometimes these things aren't over as quickly as they seem to be. I can help if you have any more problems. Thank you, that will not be necessary. Alexander will not repeat this mistake. The prototype is in position. Initiate a radial link to the ship. Link established. Receiving telemetry now. Incoming message from Dr Ja'Dar. On screen. Captain, we're ready to begin launch sequence. Mr. Riker. All science labs standing by. Course laid in, sir. The Enterprise is ready. This is Dr Ja'Dar to all stations. You may begin the launch sequence. And, Doctor...? Good luck. Thank you, Captain. Sensors indicate the field generators on the planet are charging. Soliton wave has been initiated. It's heading for the test ship. The test ship has successfully entered warp, sir. Ensign, engage. Bring us within 20 kilometers of the test ship. Aye, sir. Telemetry looks good. Soliton wave is steady. The test ship is maintaining at warp 2.35, sir. Faster than anticipated, but well within mission parameters. We're at 20 kilometers. Mr. Data, is the wave affecting our warp drive? No, sir. The effect is localized to two kilometers of the wave front. What's the power efficiency of the wave? Energy transfer is... 98 percent! 98? There's less than two-percent energy loss between the wave and the ship. That is 450 percent more efficient than our warp drive. Astonishing. Have science lab three begin a series of gamma-emission tests. Sir, the wave's power signature is fluctuating. Wave efficiency has dropped to 73 percent. The test ship's warp field has multiple disruptions. I'm reading a severe subspace distortion, sir. It is expanding toward us and interfering with our engines. I can't compensate for it. Bring us out of warp. All stop. Aye, sir. All stop. Hold on! Damage report? Sensors and warp drive are off line. Deflectors down to 15 percent. Injuries on deck 27. No fatalities. What happened? Readings indicate the craft exploded due to extreme shearing stress. Incoming message from Bilana III. On screen. Captain, are you alright? Was anyone hurt? We sustained some minor damage. What happened? The preliminary data indicate a transient power imbalance. That matches our readings. We detected a drop in transfer efficiency just before the explosion. Are you still tracking the wave? No, our sensor array was damaged. We'll repair it soon. We'll contact you when the sensors are back on line. Doctor. You did it. Warp without warp drive. For a while it was something to see. Well, I hope you're here to see it next time we try, Mr. La Forge. So do l, Doctor. I apologize. I was detained. It's quite alright. Please, sit down. Thank you. Lieutenant, your son is a very bright, very spirited young man. From his test scores, I'm sure he'll be one of my best students. However, from his behaviour in class so far, I do have some concerns. What sort of concerns? Frankly, he's defiant, he's overly aggressive toward the other students and he has difficulty paying attention. Perhaps you do not have experience dealing with Klingon children. They require a firm hand. And he seems to still have difficulty telling the truth. He takes toys from other students and then denies taking them. He acts like a bully and then says someone else started the fight. And he's bluntly told me you said Klingons do not listen to teachers. I did not tell him that. No, of course not. He's acting on his internal feelings and then making up stories to explain them. It might be a good idea for you both to sit down with Counsellor Troi... Computer, where is Alexander Rozhenko? Alexander Rozhenko is on holodeck four. Lieutenant! I think we should... I will handle this. Computer, what program is running? Callisthenics program of Lt Worf. Difficulty level, novice. Computer, freeze program. Did you see it, Father? I won! Yes, I saw. Why are you here? I'm training. You did not ask permission to take my bat'leth, or to use the holodeck. But you wanted me to be a warrior. I also said I wanted you to obey your teachers and keep your promise to me. Ms Kyle told me about your behaviour, about your lies. I have not lied! Do not continue... She's lying. She hates me! She makes up stories about me! I will not listen to more lies. Return to our quarters. You said we could go see the gilvos. Not now. Not after you have broken your word. You promised. You said we could. Enough! It is now clear to me that I failed in my duties as your father. You have no understanding about what it means to be Klingon. I will arrange for you to attend a Klingon school, to learn the lessons I failed to teach you. No, I won't go! Would you further dishonour our family with your disobedience? No, sir. You will go to our quarters and remain there until I return. What's your estimate on the engines, Geordi? I need another hour. I still have to replace three power couplings. Understood. Sir, sensors are coming on line. Good. Begin a sensor sweep for the soliton wave. Aye, sir. The wave is continuing on a course to the Lemma Il colony. It is bearing 020, mark 329. Open a channel back here to Dr Ja'Dar. Sir, the wave has increased in velocity to warp 4.1. Doctor, the soliton wave is still on course to Lemma II. However, the velocity has increased to warp 4.1. Have you checked the subspace... ? Sir, the energy level of the wave has increased by a factor of 12. It will increase by a factor of 200 by the time it reaches Lemma II. Can we still dissipate the wave? At that energy level, it will destroy the colony and take most of the planet with it. Are you sure this is what you want? It is not a question of what I want, but of what is best for the boy. He will do better in Klingon school. Did you discuss it with him? He is a child. I informed him of my decision. I see. You disapprove? I'm not here to approve or disapprove of the way you raise your son. My concern is how this decision will affect you. How will you feel when Alexander's gone? I will be pleased that he is receiving the guidance he requires. Is that how you felt when he left to live with your parents? That was different. At the time, I felt he needed a home, a family. Things I could not provide for him. I understand. The idea of raising a child can seem a tremendous burden, especially to a solitary parent. He was no burden. I simply knew that a Klingon child required more... attention than I could provide. I see. Have you ever wondered how Alexander felt about being sent away? He was... very young. I am sure that he was confused. Do you think he felt abandoned? After all, he left very soon after K'Ehleyr's death. In a way, he not only lost his mother, he lost his father as well. Are you saying that his misconduct is a result of feeling abandoned? It's possible. Children don't have the experience to handle emotional crises. Instead of dealing with their feelings, they act on them. Tell me about the last time you spoke with K'Ehleyr. The night she died. We argued. About what? Alexander. About how she did not tell me about him when he was born. So you were angry with her? Yes. Are you still angry with her? Of course not. It would be very normal to be angry with her. Angry because she died and left you with a son you never knew you had. Being angry doesn't mean you loved her any less, Worf. But you can't hide from your feelings. Just as Alexander can't hide from his. You both have a lot of healing to do. Perhaps you should think about doing it together. Alexander. I'm almost done. Stop for a moment. Let us talk. Why? I want you to understand why you are going away. I understand. You're ashamed of me. You do not understand. I am concerned about your future. A Klingon school will be a better environment. You don't care about me! That is not true! You only care about your honour. Alex... ! If your mother were here, I doubt she would want us to fight. My mother wouldn't send me away! Lt Worf, please report to the observation lounge. Acknowledged. Remain here. I will return shortly. Report. The soliton wave has continued to increase in... Excuse me. It is increasing in power. Its energy level has risen by a factor of 96. At that rate, it should hit the planet in a couple of hours. How do we stop it? There are two possibilities. We could use our own engines to generate an inverse-resonance wave. If we match the frequency and amplitude of the soliton, we should be able to neutralize it. You don't sound very confident. Because the soliton keeps changing frequency and amplitude, it would be difficult to achieve an exact match. Let's hear the second option. It's more dangerous, but there's a better chance of success. We could create a backfire, an explosive force set off just in front of the wave. A large enough explosion, say, five photon torpedoes, should disrupt it and allow it to dissipate. How fast is the wave travelling now? Warp 6.37, sir. We can catch it, but to set up the backfire, we have to be in front of it. Which means going through the wave. Why not around it? The wave has grown in size as well as power. There is no time to circumvent it before it reaches Lemma II. How much protection will the shields provide if we penetrate it? The shields are not fully restored. Shield strength is down to 33 percent. It's going to be quite a ride. It's a better choice. Lay in a course for the soliton wave. After we pass through the wave, take us 23 kilometres in front of it. Aye, sir. Alert sickbay to possible casualties. The wave has increased speed to warp 7.2. Ensign, take us to warp 7.21. We're approaching the wave. Distance 200 kilometres. Let's see it. Stand by to increase speed to warp 7.3. On my mark. Red alert. Load torpedoes. Set warhead yield to level 16. Aye, sir. All decks, this is the bridge. Brace for impact. Torpedoes loaded. Engage. Report. We are through the wave, Captain. We've dropped to warp 7.2. The wave is directly astern, 23 kilometres. Deflector strength is down to 12 percent. There are fluctuation in warp-transfer conduits. Tractor beams and transporters off line. We have some gaps in the aft shields. When the torpedoes explode, ion radiation will flood these areas. We need to evacuate sections 24 to 47, decks 35 to 38. Make it so. Sir, there's a fire in boilable four. The fire-suppression apparatus is out. Seal off that compartment. There are life forms in that lab. We're transporting endangered animals. Readings also indicate a humanoid. Computer, identify humanoid life form in lab four. Life form is identified as Alexander Rozhenko. Bridge to biolab four. Alexander, can you hear us? He is alive. He may be injured. Can we transport him out? Transporters are still off line. Power is dropping. We're losing speed. Geordi, what's going on? We lost four warp-transfer conduits. The wave is gaining. We need more speed! I can't keep this speed up. Fire the torpedoes while we're still in front of the wave. When will the wave overtake us? Four minutes, 30 seconds, sir. Permission to leave the bridge? Granted. Commander, go with him. Captain, biolab four will be flooded with ion radiation. Commander. That wave can't hit the colony. You have three minutes, not one second more. Primary control's shorted out. Stand clear! Alexander! Alexander! Can you hear me? The soliton wave has closed to ten kilometres. Ready with torpedoes at my command. Alexander! Commander, I've found him! Worf! Where are you, Worf? Over here. Help me. It's too heavy. I'll find something to help us. Father... ! Lie still. I am here. My leg hurts. I'm scared. The gilvos! There's no time. Please, they'll die! The wave is one kilometer, Captain. Picard to Cmdr Riker. Bridge to Lt Worf. Acknowledge. The wave is about to overtake us. Cmdr Riker, acknowledge! Fire torpedoes. The wave has been disrupted, sir. Picard to Riker. Riker here, Captain. We made it, sir. The boy's gonna be alright. You're a very lucky boy. Some minor smoke inhalation and a hairline fracture of the tibia. That's a bone in your leg. I'll keep him here overnight, but he'll be fine by tomorrow. Thank you, Doctor. Are you going to get in trouble because of me? Do not concern yourself with that. Am I in trouble? Yes. But we will discuss that later. I'm sorry. I promise I'll be good at the Klingon school. I'll make you proud of me. Klingon schools are designed to be difficult. The physical and mental hardships faced by the students are meant to build character and strength. However,... ..if you wish to face a greater challenge, you may stay here with me. It will not be easy... ..for either of us. But perhaps we can face the challenge together. I accept your challenge, Father. I will stay. I believe your mother would be pleased. "
S5E11,"Captain's log, star date 45397.3. Two days ago, Star base 514 lost contact with the research vessel Vico which was sent to explore the Black Cluster. We are en route to investigate. Captain, we're entering Sector 97. I am picking up gravitational fluctuations. Take us out of warp, Ensign. Yes, sir. The Black Cluster is within visual range. On screen. Aye, sir. Let's find that ship. Full sensor sweep. Aye, sir. What a sight. One of the most ancient formations in the galaxy. I have located the Vico. It appears to be adrift. Let's see it. Life signs? Nothing, Commander. Damage report, Mr. Data? Outer and inner hulls have been breached. Decks seven to 12 are exposed to space. Set up a translink to their computer core. I cannot. The emergency bulkheads are in place. Our signal cannot penetrate them. Structural status? Stress readings indicate pressure on the transfer supports. Stable enough for an away team? Yes, sir, but the risk of collapse is high. Have transporter room one maintain a lock on the away team. Take us to 15,000 metres. Data, you're with me. This station is inoperable, sir. This one is stuck in a loop. Tap into the computer. The ODN junction is down here. Data? Core transfer is engaged. Exchange protocol verified. The files are intact. At least, some of them. Stay here, Geordi. Data. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, supplemental. A young boy, shielded from sensor scans, has been discovered pinned beneath a fallen beam. The damage to the Vico is making rescue difficult. Transporter room one, can you transport him directly to sickbay? I'll try, Captain. But there's a lot of shielding. Acknowledged. Picard to Crusher. Sickbay here, Captain. Prepare for emergency transport. Yes, sir. Crusher out. Picard to Riker. Is the boy ready? Ready, sir. It's your signal. Aye, Captain. It's going to be OK. Here we go. Energize. Ensign, do we have him? The lock is holding. I just can't resolve the matter stream, not with all that victurium alloy. Cmdr Riker, get him into the corridor. I could move the beam. But it may initiate the collapse of the supports. I recommend you and Geordi return. Agreed. La Forge. I'm locked onto them. I'll energize once they clear the bulkheads. Whenever you're ready. Yes, sir. Are you gonna lift that? Yes. Then I will take you to the corridor. We will transport to the Enterprise from there. How can you pick that up? I am an android. My strength is many times that of a human. It is going to be OK. I will count to three. One, two, three. Energize. Don't be afraid. Captain's log, supplemental. A search of the Vico has revealed no additional survivors. We have begun counselling the boy about the tragedy. We were in the Black Cluster. I don't know where they came from. They had a big ship. They kept shooting at us. Then they beamed over. They had purple helmets on and phaser rifles. I saw them. They didn't see me. You're safe now, Timothy. I'm sorry for what happened. It's gonna be alright. I bet you're hungry. Would you like something to eat? I must join La Forge in Engineering. If you will excuse me. Timothy, would you like Data to stay a little longer? Sections of the primary and secondary hulls were torn off. The shearing planes are here, here and here. How much longer till we can access their logs? Almost an hour. The boy was here. The hallway outside the computer core. His mother was the systems engineer. The second away team found her body inside the core. And his father? Ship's second officer. He was most likely on the bridge when it was exposed to space. Most likely. He'll sleep for a few hours at least. I don't need to keep him here but I need to see him tomorrow. You've got your work cut out for you. His world is gone. We have to help him build a new one. This is not good. Whatever hit the Vico set up an EM pulse that flashed through their computer banks. Nearly 83 percent of their records have been lost. All their sensor logs. Let's use what we got from our own sensors. I'll call up the structural analysis and the surface scans. Geordi, as a child, did you ever experience a traumatic event? You're wondering about Timothy? Yes. I was caught in a fire once. I must have been, I don't know, about five, I guess. It was before I got the first visor. And it was only a couple of minutes before my parents pulled me out. And nobody got hurt, but I tell you,... ..that was the longest couple of minutes of my life. It was a while before I could let my parents get out of earshot. It was like I absolutely needed to know that they were there, you know? Timothy no longer has that support. Yeah. ""Dara and her brother found themselves in Tagas, where the ruler, Elamos the Magnificent, proclaimed as law, 'No children will be tolerated within the great kingdom.""' ""When Dara saw the proclamation, she laughed and said, 'How magnificent a ruler, to be frightened by us!""' We're done with sculpture. It's not finished. We'll come back to it. Why not pick up your mythology book? But it's not finished. Magnetic analysis confirms the Vico was definitely attacked inside the Black Cluster. Graviton wave fronts pushed it to where we found it. No signs of phaser burns? No, sir. Torsional-stress levels point to a disruptor-style weapon. Fracture points indicate a range of less than 3,000 metres. That's a strategy consistent with a cloaked vessel. Romulan. Or Klingon. But we're a distance from their territories. The Breen have outposts in this sector. The attack is consistent with their battle tactics and their technology. Thank you. But what would the Breen be doing inside the Black Cluster? The boy described a boarding party with helmets and phaser rifles. Boarding party? I don't think that's likely, sir. Counsellor. There was no evidence of anyone coming aboard the Vico. We'd have a transporter-field trace. Or in the entry ports, we would have found an electrostatic differential, and we didn't. Could Timothy have imagined that? Or could he be lying? If he's lying, I haven't sensed it. Perhaps his emotional-trauma level is too high. Why wouldn't he tell the truth? He's in shock. It's hard to know what's going on in his mind. I'll check the readings again, but we won't find anything. Thank you, Geordi. Data. Captain, we should ask Data to spend time with him. I do not understand. I'm worried about his behaviour. What I just heard doesn't make me feel better. You're the only one he's reached out to. You rescued him. We can use your relationship to help him. Would Timothy be inclined to tell Data the truth? It's a possibility. Proceed with Timothy as the Counsellor suggests. Aye, sir. Counsellor, exactly how shall I proceed? Just be with him. Your presence he trusts. That's what he needs most now. What? Data. Hello, Timothy. May I enter? Yeah. You are attempting to recreate... ..the Dokkaran temple of Kural-Hanesh? Isn't it great? There's the big hallway the teacher told us about. That's where everybody came in. That's where they stood. That's where the altar was. What do you think? Do you wish a frank evaluation? It lacks the harmony of the temple, and Dokkaran culture in general. You hate it. No. I am not capable of hatred. I can't do anything right. You are making an unwarranted extrapolation. I was offering an aesthetic analysis of this model. The base appears quite sturdy. I told you! May I suggest a different approach? You were constructing the upper level before the supports were in place. Observe. La Forge to Data. Data here. I need help with the modulators. I will join you in a moment. Lt La Forge requires my assistance. Incredible. Data. How come you can do that? I am designed to exceed human capacity, mentally and physically. Androids are better than humans? ""Better"" is a highly subjective term. I do not possess the ability to experience emotion as humans do. No emotions? You mean, you can't be happy or sad? That is correct. Why not? My positronic brain is not able to generate those conditions. Goodbye. Data! Can we build something else later? That would be acceptable. Bye! I am designed to exceed human capacity. That is correct. The Black Cluster was formed nine billion years ago when hundreds of protostars collapsed in close proximity. The gravitational forces are both violent and unpredictable. To get near the centre, we have to push through the graviton wave fronts. I've adjusted our shields. The gravitational forces will affect sensor accuracy. Detecting an enemy vessel will be difficult. Maybe the Vico didn't see anything until it was too late. Counsellor, has the boy volunteered any information? No, but I do have an appointment with him. If there's a possibility of getting more from him, pursue it. But we need to continue our investigation. We'll enter the Black Cluster at 0700 hours tomorrow. Dismissed. Hello, Timothy. Are you ready to go? Yes. I am ready. How are you feeling? I am functioning within established parameters. Established parameters? You sound like Data. I am an android. I see. Well, let's go for our walk, shall we? That would be acceptable. So, what would you like? Androids do not need to eat or drink. However, we sometimes like to taste things. A Tamarian frost, please. Would you like anything? No, I'm fine, thank you. As you wish. So, you're no longer human? I'm an android. When did this happen? I've always been an android. What's it like, being an android? I am designed to exceed human capacity, both mentally and physically. But I do not experience emotions. You don't? No emotion at all? That is correct. An android? I know it sounds unusual. But it is understandable. Technically, it's called enantiodromia, conversion into the opposite. Timothy went from human to machine, from being emotional to being emotionless. But the underlying trauma is still there. He's just found a new way to suppress it. Counsellor. How long will this behaviour last? As long as he needs it to. Timothy is rebuilding his identity. The android persona is just one step along the way. As soon as he feels stronger, it should drop away. This is not the time to confront him about his ship? Not yet. The best thing we can do now is let Timothy take us where he wants to go. We should support the process, even encourage it. Data, make Timothy the best android he can possibly be. Timothy, your head movements are counterproductive. Can you be still? But you do it. The mechanisms in my neck approximate human movements. I did not realize the effect was so distracting. I like it. Data, are there any other androids in Starfleet? No, I am the only one. How come you're not captain? My service record does not yet warrant such a position. Data. What's the scariest thing that ever happened to you? Fear is not a quality that I possess. Because it's an emotion? Correct. But what if you had a nightmare? I have never had a nightmare. I do not require sleep. Timothy. Are you having disturbing dreams? I do not require sleep. Is that satisfactory? It's perfect. Transfer circuits are functioning. Within established parameters? Absolutely. Input processing, pattern recognition, all within established parameters. Thank you, Doctor. I ran out of red ochre. You may use mine. Thank you. Perhaps you should return to your quarters. I'm fine. The mechanisms in my mouth approximate human movements. That is not bad. Thank you. It is very expressive. Thank you. Is your painting representative of something? It's just a painting. Timothy, you understand that you may speak to me about anything you wish? Any subject? I understand. At times, l, too, find it difficult to share my thoughts with others. I am not always confident that I express myself in a manner which humans can comprehend. But I know... We are approaching the perimeter. Picking up wave fronts. Engage forward shields 35 percent. Shields up. Drop to one-quarter impulse. Yes, sir. Bridge to Engineering. Adjusting shield frequencies now. We'll have this smoothed out in just a second. Adjust course for any deviations. Yes, sir. Resume one-third impulse. Captain. I am reading something at 400,000 kilometres off starboard. Possibly a ship. Red alert! Take us to visual range. Adjusting course. Sensor readings have disappeared. Wait! I have another reading at 400,000 kilometres off the port bow. It's gone. No. It is back to starboard. The cluster is distorting the sensors. We are picking up our echoes reflecting off the wave fronts. Cancel red alert. Mr. Worf, adjust sensors to compensate. Aye. Sensor difficulties have been reported, but never this extreme. That formation is seven times more massive than any explored previously. That could explain the difference. Resume previous course. Yes, sir. He laughed. Yes. It's nice to see, isn't it? It is certainly not consistent with his android persona. I'd say he's beginning to let go of that fantasy. Then my work with him is done. No, I don't think it is, Data. A laugh is one step in the right direction. We need to help him take more steps. How, Counsellor? I'd like you to talk to him about your fascination with humanity. If you explain to Timothy the appeal that humanity has for you, he might find it easier to become a boy again. This is great. How is yours? The polysaccharides in reaction with the carbon dioxide produces an unusual combination of texture and effervescence. But how does it taste? Is it good? I am not capable of tasting in the manner you suggest. However, I can analyze the composition of a dessert and make comparative conclusions about its effect on the palate. But I neither like it nor dislike it. I didn't realize that. I often wonder what it must be like to have one's mouth water in anticipation of a confection, or to feel the pleasure I observe in humans as they consume it. You sound like you don't want to be an android. I am an android. That will never change. But if you could change, would you? I have often wished to be human. I study people in order to approximate human behaviour. Why? We're stronger and smarter than humans. We can do more. But I cannot take pride in my abilities. I cannot take pleasure in my accomplishments. But we never have to feel bad, either. I would gladly risk feeling bad at times if it also meant that I could taste my dessert. Gravitational-wave front intensity is increasing steadily. 1100 standard G units and rising. Let's see if anyone's out there. Mr. Worf, attempt a wide-range sensor sweep. Aye, sir. Gravitational distortion is too great. The scanning signal is again being reflected. I'm unable to compensate. The sensors are useless. Mr. Data to the bridge. Acknowledged. Adjust sensors to short range. Attempt a limited positron scan. The distortion is still in effect. Better jacket the scanning beam. The secondary beam is being distorted as well. Mr. Data, our sensors are rendered ineffective by the distortion. I want your analysis. Mr. Worf. Fire phasers, maximum intensity, limited spectrum. 001, mark 045. An experiment, Captain? Exactly, Number One. Firing phasers. Explanation, Mr. Data? Phaser energy was reflected by the wave fronts. It is similar to the phenomenon distorting our sensors. Phasers and sensors both useless? Mr. Data, this reflection phenomenon, would it have the same effect on a disruptor? Yes. Disruptors would be ineffective. The ship's cloaking field? Difficult to maintain, sir. Mr. Data, is it likely that the Vico was attacked inside the cluster? Given these effects, the probability is exceedingly remote, sir. Picard to Counsellor Troi. Yes, Captain? Counsellor, bring Timothy to my ready room. Can you tell us what happened to your ship? I did tell you! Tell us again. We were attacked. That is highly unlikely. Our investigations... We were attacked! Timothy. Androids do not lie. It was me. Please explain. It was me. I did it. I killed them all. Everything was shaking. I lost my balance. I was just trying to hold on to something. I didn't mean to do it. What didn't you mean to do? My arm hit the computer panel. That's what destroyed the ship. The ship was damaged when your arm hit the computer panel? Timothy, listen to me. The damage to your ship might have occurred at the same time your arm touched the panel. But it was only a coincidence. This wasn't your fault. Yes, it was! It is not possible. The on-board control systems for every starship require a user-code clearance. You could not inadvertently affect the Vico's systems. Your computer had safety precautions. There is nothing you touched that would damage your ship. You're not responsible for what happened to your parents. But if it wasn't me... We are trying to determine what happened right now. If there is anything you can remember that might assist... That's just how it was when it started on the Vico. Wave front intensity has increased. Increase shields to 75 percent. Aye, sir. Damage, Worf? Minimal. Shields are holding. Ensign, full about. Go to warp two. The gravitational distortion is too high. We can't maintain a warp field. Full shields. Aye. Captain, impulse power has been disrupted. The helm won't respond. We couldn't get out either. Timothy, perhaps we should go below, out of the way. No! La Forge. More power to the shields. Stand by. That's what they kept saying. ""More shields."" ""More shields."" Timothy, accompany me, please. Recall everything said aboard the Vico before it was destroyed. I don't know. Just ""more shields"". Captain, I've transferred fusion reactors into the shield array. That doubles shield strength. Wave front intensity has increased by an order of magnitude. Impact in three, two, one. Wave front intensity is increasing. Structural over-pressure exceeding 180 percent. La Forge? I don't understand. We could run it off the warp drive. Go ahead. Initiating warp-transfer pathways now. Diverting warp power to the shields. Warp power to the shields. They said that, too. I'm positive. Wave front intensity has increased by a factor of ten. Contact in 31 seconds. Without more power to the shields, the hull will not hold. La Forge! Transfer to the shields complete. That's as strong as they'll get. Impact in 15 seconds. Sir, drop the shields. That's suicide, Data! Captain, drop the shields. Make it so! Aye. Our shields caused the increases in the wave fronts. We experienced a harmonic-amplification effect. The more energy to the shield, the worse the impact. Precisely. That is also what destroyed the Vico. When Timothy remembered similar procedures on his ship, I analyzed shield output to wave front amplification and discovered a correlation. If we had transferred all that power, it would have torn the ship apart. Status? Navigation is back on line. Full about. One-quarter impulse. Take us out of here. Timothy is a boy feeling great pain. But he is a boy again. Is this difficult for you, Data? Difficult? To watch him moving away from being like you? That would require an emotional context which I cannot provide. OK, everybody, let's go. Come on. Hello, Timothy. Hi, Data. How are you? I am operating within established parameters. How are you? I miss my parents. But, I'm OK. I guess you thought I was silly when I had my hair like yours. I have been told that imitation is the highest flattery. Can we still do things, even if I'm not really an android? I have many human friends. I would be pleased to count you among them. That would be... ..acceptable. "
S5E12,"Captain's log, star date 45429.3. While on a mapping survey, we are conveying Ullians to Kaldra IV. These telepathic historians conduct their research by retrieving long-forgotten memories. It's a chipped cup, off-white, with a crack in it. I can see it, but I don't remember more about it. When you see it, do you hear any sounds? No, I don't think so. Wait. Yes. Humming. Someone's humming. A woman? Yes, but I don't know who it is. Try to touch the cup. It has a sharp edge where it's chipped. Is there anything inside the cup? A liquid, dark. Like tea? It's not hot. It's bitter. There's something else in the cup. Yes! A wooden handle. A spoon? No, it's more delicate than that. Reach out for it. A brush! An ink brush. I hear that humming again. Keep listening to it, and hold out the brush. See if anyone takes it from you. It's Obaachan! My grandmother! She's doing ink brush writing. I can remember it now. She used that cup for cleaning the brushes. It was my job to fill it with water and bring it to the table. I'd sit and watch the most beautiful characters come from that brush. The whole time she'd hum to herself. I remember it like it was yesterday. That is remarkable, you remembered such vivid details. For years, I've seen that cup in my memory, but I could never remember what it was or why it was important. Thank you. You're welcome, young lady. Perhaps someone else would care to try? You, madam? You're thinking about that first childhood kiss. Would you like to remember more about it? Father, you mustn't probe someone's memory without permission. You are right. But sometimes, with a beautiful woman, I cannot help myself. How about you? Any memories you feel like digging up? None I'd share with an audience. It's late. I'd better go. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. It is perplexing that the Ullians' ability to retrieve memory is highly prized. If an event were important enough, why would it have been forgotten? It's not the same for us as it is for you. You record every second of your life. That is correct. If you want to recall any moment, you access the proper memory circuit. My understanding suggests the process is the same for you. Each memory is encoded in chains of molecules. To retrieve it, you simply access the proper RNA sequence. Yeah, that's true. Then, in what way is it different? Sometimes, there are memories we just can't access at the spur of the moment. For instance, I have no recollection of how I spent my last birthday. Birthdays are important. I should remember how I spent the day. But, right now, I can't even remember where I was. Deck two. On the other hand, I remember my first pet. A Circassian cat. I was eight. I remember how funny-looking he was. I remember how excited I was. It was as if it happened yesterday. Perhaps you forget the unpleasant memories. No, sometimes, bad memories are the most intense of all. It would seem there is no predictable pattern to human memory. It would seem. This library of ours has been in the planning stages for years. The retrieved memories of races from many different star systems. What my son means to say is we think of ourselves as archaeologists of the mind. The history of a world is contained in the personal experience of its people. Like ancient oral historians on Earth. Exactly. The library we propose will be a vast storehouse of these individual memories. That's quite a project. How long will your Kaldra studies take? Many months. We've been working for years. We've surveyed only 11 planets in eight star systems. It's our way of life. We wouldn't want to do anything else. Captain, Mr. Tarmin gave a demonstration of his abilities today. It's fascinating. Perhaps you would like to resurrect some memories. I'd be happy to probe your recollections. Most people find it an enjoyable experience. I'm sure. However, I don't think I'd make a particularly good subject. I'm sure you'd be ideal, and you must have some intriguing memories. We won't be on your ship for long. This may be your last chance. Yes. Well... Tarmin, we mustn't influence people. We must let them come to us willingly. I have found over the years there are many who want the experience of memory retrieval, but lack encouragement to come forward. You, Mr. Worf. I would love to explore Klingon memories. Klingons do not allow themselves to be probed. There is nothing to fear. Father. I am not fearful. Cmdr La Forge, you? I don't think so. Thanks, anyway. I have rarely encountered such squeamish people. Dr Crusher? Cmdr Riker? Mr. Tarmin, are all Ullians able to read memories? No, my dear. The technique requires special training. It is a serious commitment. It takes years of study. Tarmin is the most proficient of our group. Once, Jev spent two days with a contingent of elderly Gentons. He couldn't get anything from them. I spent an hour with them and retrieved a fragment from the Gentonian trade wars. Excuse me. Exactly how long will it be before we get to Kaldra, Captain? Mr. Data? Four days, 11 hours. Jev? I'm sorry. I'm being rude. No, not at all. My father finds it amusing to demean me in public. I reach the point where I don't want to hear any more. It's not easy having an overbearing parent. Believe me, I know how you feel. That's right, you're an empath. I can't read Ullians. But I do know a certain Betazoid mother who is a great deal like your father. Deck eight. Deck 16. I've learned to remind myself that my mother and I are two separate individuals. And have you enjoyed much success with this approach, Counsellor? No. But I do keep reminding myself. Goodnight. Goodnight, Counsellor. And thank you. Have you stopped thinking about us? Hot chocolate. Imzadi, we can't. Not when we're serving on the same ship. Have you stopped thinking about us? Just answer that. I can't stop thinking about you. Will, don't. ""Imzadi"", we can't. Not when we're serving on the same ship. Have you stopped thinking about us? We mustn't do this. Will, don't! Will! No! Imzadi. Have you stopped thinking about us? Just answer that. No! Don't! I can't stop thinking about you. Imzadi. Have you stopped thinking about us? No! Captain's log, star date 45430.9. Counsellor Troi has fallen into a deep coma. Dr Crusher has been unable to find signs of illness or infection. Any change, Dr Martin? No. I'm still getting unusual neural-transmitter readings, but they might be a result of the coma. Can you bring her out? I've tried revival techniques. She doesn't respond. Until I find the cause, I don't want to try anything extreme. Do you know what she was doing? No. She was found this morning when she missed an appointment. She was dressed for bed, but it hadn't been slept in. Who was the last person to see her? She left the dinner with a Ullian. I'll talk to him. Ask if they would consent to an examination, just to be certain. I'll check the readings from the Ullian transporter log. They could still be carrying a harmful organism. May I join you? Commander. Of course. Something's wrong? Counsellor Troi's ill. Sorry to hear it. More than ill, she's in a coma. Dr Crusher doesn't know how to treat her. When did this happen? Apparently, some time last night. That's why I wanted to talk to you. You were the last person to see her. Did you go with her into her quarters? Are you suggesting that I behaved improperly? Not at all. I'm just trying to trace her steps. We talked in a turbo lift briefly. She got out at deck eight. I did not go with her. Jev, I'm not accusing you of anything. Did she mention feeling ill? She seemed fine. She has a wonderful sense of humour. If you have no objections, Dr Crusher wants to examine you and your group. To what end? To eliminate the possibility that you carry an organism that was harmful to Deanna. I'm not implying that you did anything intentional, I'm just trying to solve the mystery. We have nothing to hide. If you wish to examine us... Fine. Thank you. Deanna, I don't know if you can hear me. I've heard doctors say that even when someone's in a coma, they may be able to hear when people talk to them. That it might help stimulate the brain, speed a healing. I think you did that for me once, when I was in pretty bad shape. I just thought it might help to hear a friendly voice,... ..even if you don't know you're hearing it. We've been busy mapping the sector. It's been pretty routine. The most unusual thing we've seen is a binary star system. Let's see, what else...? We finished the personnel review that we were working on. You can check it out when you wake up. I miss you. Please don't stay away too long. Will. I promise I'll let you know the minute she regains consciousness. I know. There's nothing you can do here. You'll wear yourself out. Right. It's late. Go to bed. That's an order. Keller is still in there! Let's move it! Let's go! Everybody move! Out! Come on! Keep moving! Commander! I need to bring that door down! ..breach. Evacuate immediately. Keller, can you get to a Jefferies tube? Ensign Keller, answer me! You killed her! Keller is still in there! Radiation levels are critical. We've got to seal it off. She was right behind me. Bring down the door. Keep moving. Commander. I need to bring that door down. Out! Let's go! Keller is still in there! Keller is still in there. Riker to transporter room three. Prepare to beam Ensign Keller out. Keller is still in there! You killed her! Ensign Keller, answer me. You killed her. I've got to get that isolation door down. Keller is still in there! Bring down the door! You killed her. You killed her. I need that door down. You killed her. What's going on? Bridge to Cmdr Riker. Picard to Cmdr Riker. Answer, please. Computer, locate Cmdr Riker. Cmdr Riker is in his quarters. On my way, sir. Medical log, star date 45431. 7. Cmdr Riker is the second officer to fall into an unexplained coma. I've ruled out the possibility that the Ullians carry an organism. I compared Deanna's brain scan to her last physical. There is a difference. This time there's a trace of electropathic activity. And Cmdr Riker? The same pattern. If I didn't know better, I'd say Iresine Syndrome. That's the only thing that would produce that pattern. What is Iresine Syndrome? A rare neurological disorder first diagnosed in the 23rd century. It's characterized by an electropathic residue. Why discount the possibility that it's responsible? It's always accompanied by a severely decreased histamine count. Will and Deanna show normal levels. I've asked Cmdr La Forge to conduct a diagnostic to determine any other agent that might cause the same pattern. Cmdr Riker and Counsellor Troi were in perfect health until the Ullians arrived. It would be wise to quarantine the aliens. I believe it would be premature to take that action. There's no real evidence linking these comas with the Ullians. But there is something curious. The residue I discovered is located in the thalamus, the area of the cerebral cortex that involves memory function. I've been accused of putting people to sleep with one too many stories. But it's the first time it's been suggested that I caused a coma. I mean no disrespect, but we are faced with an alarming situation. Why do you suspect us, Captain? Suspect is too strong a word. I'm simply trying to determine what has caused my officers' comas. But you've already examined us. We aren't carrying anything harmful. Studying the victims, I detected abnormal patterns in the area of the brain involving memory. In the light of your telepathic abilities, it raises the question. It is not our wish to obstruct you. What would you like? If I could do some further examinations tomorrow, perhaps monitor you during a memory probe. Scrutiny does not frighten us. We will be happy to cooperate, Doctor. Thank you. I'll contact you in the morning. You're the only person to undergo a memory probe by the Ullians, I'd like to see if I can detect any residual effect. Dr Martin will monitor your signs while I conduct the scan. I'm happy to help. Have you noticed any unusual symptoms since the probe? Headaches? Dizziness? No, nothing like that. It was a wonderful experience. Electrical activity is normal. CPK levels are normal. Hippocampus is stable. And the thalamus... The thalamus is normal. There is no indication of any electropathic residual. Is that good? You're fine, Keiko. But I am no closer to solving this mystery. Computer, locate the electropathic pattern described in medical database four-delta-one. Electropathic pattern located. OK, we're going to track down any possible cause of that brain pattern. What medical conditions might account for it? Iresine Syndrome is a cause of the electropathic pattern. Right. Dr Crusher already eliminated that. How many non-medical forces or substances might cause the pattern? There are 22 non-medical agents. OK. And how many of those are present on the Enterprise? None are present on the Enterprise. Are the sensors calibrated to detect all those agents? All agents are scanned by the sensors. OK. Let's start with the chemical substances. Name them. Ferrazene, hylanatine, dardilion, chrysimite and manzene. Ferrazene has a complex structure. It breaks down into bilenium and tarrisite. Do the sensors scan for those? Sensors scan for both compounds. And are they present on board? Bilenium and tarrisite are not present. Do any break down into by-products that are not scanned for? Dardilion contains the by-product nilizene. Sensors do not routinely scan for that substance. Well, this isn't a routine situation. Scan for the nilizene. There is no nilizene on the Enterprise. How did I know you were gonna say that? OK, let's move on to the non-chemical agents. Anything more I can do for you? No, thanks. I was just reading about the Iresine Syndrome. A new strain might explain the normal histamine counts. Any luck? Not so far. OK. I'll see you tomorrow. You shouldn't remember him like this. You don't have to do this. It's important to me. I have to see him. It's good of you to come. It's the least I can do. You shouldn't remember him like this. I have to face the fact that he's gone. You shouldn't remember him like this. It's good of you to come with me. It's the least I can do. You shouldn't remember him like this. It's the least I can do. I spent two hours chatting with the computer. I've checked everything. Anything that might cause that electropathic pattern. I assume you were unsuccessful? Didn't find a thing. Dr Crusher's not going to be too happy with... Emergency Medical team to Dr Crusher's office immediately. Dr Crusher had me working on a diagnostic. I'd gone to give her the results. Did the scans provide any insights? None. I cross-checked, they're just dead ends. We've eliminated all known factors which may have caused the comas except for the Ullians. Mr. Data, investigate those 11 planets that the Ullians visited. See if there were any reports of comas. Aye, sir. In the meantime, we must consider restricting them to their quarters, as a precautionary measure. Will confining telepaths prevent it from happening again? What else can we do? Station a guard? Set up a force field? They won't be any more effective. Sickbay to Capt Picard. Picard here. Counsellor Troi has regained consciousness. She's asked for you. I'm on my way. It's like waking up from a nightmare and not remembering any of it. What is the last thing you do remember? My hair. I was brushing my hair. And then? I don't know. Just waking up here. Why do I feel so frightened? What happened to me? We were hoping that you could tell us. How long have I been here? Three days. Three days? You were the first. The next day Cmdr Riker fell into a similar coma. Last night, Dr Crusher. What is going on here? We're not certain. It may be that there is some unusual effect produced by the Ullians' telepathic activity. I'm going to talk to them. You're to stay here and recuperate. But if you remember anything about what happened, I want you to tell me immediately. What are you suggesting? That you confine yourself to your quarters, until we have unravelled this mystery. We're to be prisoners? Father. No, please, don't look on it like that. We have done everything we can to explain these comas. Physical examinations, neurological scans. We have conducted a ship-wide diagnostic looking for viruses, parasites, infestations. We have investigated every cause we can imagine and found nothing, nothing to explain these comas. The only variable that we have not been able to eliminate is your presence here on this ship. Now, in the light of our actions, we would ask you to understand my request and to agree to it. Our history indicates that we do not adversely affect the people we contact. I know that. Then, are you implying an intentional assault? I'm simply considering all possibilities. Surely you'd give us the chance to prove we're innocent? If that's possible, of course. Well, then I would propose doing a memory probe of Counsellor Troi. You say she doesn't remember anything that happened before she lapsed into unconsciousness. I could retrieve that memory. There is a possibility that it could explain the coma and prove our innocence. I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly subject Counsellor Troi to a potentially dangerous procedure. And I refuse to be a party to any of these proceedings. Jev is making a reasonable request. If we're to be accused, surely we're entitled to a defence? Tarmin did a memory probe on another of your crew. Has she suffered any ill effects? No. And neither will Counsellor Troi. Please, you may have as many people there as you need to guarantee her safety. But give us this chance to vindicate ourselves. I will discuss the matter with Counsellor Troi. Well, that's it for Melina II. No unexplained comas during the time the Ullians were working there. We have yet to receive word from two planets in the Nel system. They may have different results. Maybe. And maybe we're not checking for the right thing. Please clarify. We haven't looked at the comas that were explained. Why would we do that? Remember Dr Crusher saying, after Troi became unconscious, that it looked like Iresine Syndrome except for the histamine count. Yes. Maybe not every medical facility is as careful as Dr Crusher. Maybe it's easier to just make a quick diagnosis rather than keep hunting for the real cause. You are searching for Iresine Syndrome? Right. And correlating them with visits by the Ullians. And... And there we are. Two cases on Hurada III at exactly the time Tarmin and his group were there. Check the other planets. We may have something here. I want to reiterate, if you have any doubts at all, you don't have to go through with it. I want to do it, Captain. Something awful happened to me and I don't even know what it was. Very well. What's the last thing you remember about the other night? Brushing my hair. Would you get your hairbrush? Brushing your hair, do you do it every night? Yes, when I'm ready for bed. What is it? Someone's touching my hair. Someone's with you in the room? No. No, I'm alone. There's no one there. Go on. I get some hot chocolate. Something's happening. I'm alone in my quarters. I'm remembering something from a few years ago. Go back into that memory. You said someone was touching your hair? Yes. And... It's Will Riker. That's right, I was thinking of him. Remembering a time when you were with him. Yes, after a poker game. It's pleasant. Stay with it. Now he's hurting me! You're frightened. I want him to stop! It's not Will! Somebody's taken his place! Someone else? Who is it? No! He shouldn't be here! Why is he here? Stop! You're hurting me! Can you see his face? Yes! Imzadi. No! Stop! You're hurting me! Who is it? Who is doing this to you? It's Tarmin. It's your father. Captain's log, star date 45433.2. We have set a course for Star base 440, where the Ullians will disembark and return home. Inad and I have contacted our home planet. If you want to prosecute my father, the authorities will support you. I'm not sure we have any legal basis for such a prosecution. Memory invasion is simply not a crime we've ever had to contend with. I've learned it's a practice abolished on our world centuries ago. What could motivate someone like your father to commit such an act? I don't know. A perverse source of pleasure, perhaps? A way to exercise control over another? Your father claims, quite strenuously, that he's innocent. My father has never been one to admit that he's wrong. But it is difficult to believe he'd be capable of this. I am told that the punishment for this crime is quite severe. We are monitoring my father's telepathic activities. You have my assurance he won't assault anyone else. I am sorry for this, Captain. Picard to Cmdr Data. Yes, Captain. How's your search? We have uncovered several cases, but the investigation is incomplete. Inform the medics on those planets that we have discovered the true nature of the comas. They'll appreciate knowing what happened. Yes, sir. We will keep searching. We just got the transmission from the Nel system. No Iresine Syndrome, but two unexplained comas on one planet, none on the other. And were the Ullians present? Checking the mission logs. That's funny. On star dates 45321 and 45323, when the comas occurred, Tarmin was on his home planet. He wasn't anywhere near the Nel system. Come in. Hello, Jev. We'll reach star base soon. I wanted to say goodbye and to apologize again for my father. There's no need. You're not responsible for what he did. Before all this happened, I had hoped we might become friends. We still can. After what he's put you through? Maybe you can forget. I'm not sure I can. You're so lovely. I have to go. Goodbye. Jev. You're upset. Would you like to talk? No. You'd feel better if you did. Why do you have to be so nice? So... So lovely? What's happening? It's happening again. You're so beautiful. So fragile. It was you. It was always you. Have you stopped thinking about us? No! No! Don't! I won't let you! No! Counsellor. Are you alright? Yes. Why are you here? How did you know? We discovered two unexplained comas on Nel Ill while the Ullians were there, but Tarmin was not present. Examination revealed that only one Ullian was present for all incidents of coma. Jev. Captain's log, star date 45435. 8. Dr Crusher and Cmdr Riker regained consciousness en route to the Ullian Homeworld. The slow process of their recovery has begun. I have asked that our finest physicians meet with you all upon our return to help you in your healing process. They've been in contact with us already. Thank you. It's three centuries since we treated anyone for this,... ..this form of rape. But there are medical records from that era. It was a time of great violence for my people. A time we thought we had put far behind us. That this could happen now, it's unimaginable. Earth was once a violent planet, too. At times, the chaos threatened the fabric of life, but, like you, we evolved. We found better ways to handle our conflicts. But, I think no one can deny that the seed of violence remains within each of us. We must recognize that, because that violence is capable of consuming each of us. As it consumed your son. "
S5E13,"Captain's log, star date 45470.1. The Enterprise is in the Moab Sector to track a stellar core fragment of a disintegrated neutron star. Our science teams have been asked to monitor any planetary disruption. We've got a problem. Our core fragment will pass Moab IV in six days. Isn't that what we anticipated? We didn't anticipate someone living there. An artificial environment on the southern continent, sir. You've established that there's someone inside? Yes. Sensors are reading human life forms. Human? Are they responding? Negative. Any starships reported missing in this sector, Mr. Data? No, sir. How did they find themselves on a deserted planet? They must know we're here. Mr. La Forge? Our sensors are picking up EM readings. Wave patterns from an old subspace relay. Which would suggest they can communicate with us. Mr. Worf, open frequencies commonly used in the last century. Channel open. This is Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise. It is urgent that you respond. Sir, the shield around the structure is increasing strength. Not exactly a welcome mat. We mean you no harm. We must warn you that your planet is about to experience massive seismic disruptions due to an approaching stellar core fragment. No structure will be able to withstand them. They are responding. On screen. Enterprise, I am Aaron Conor. Mr. Conor, we were unaware of human colonies in this system. I don't want to be rude, but we don't wish to interact with outsiders. I'm only responding to your warning. The fragment will have effects on your planet in six days. Yes, I know. We have been tracking it. Our biosphere can withstand quakes of 8. 7 on the Richter scale. Mr. Data? The fragment has a density of 100 billion kg per cubic cm. As a result, when it passes Moab IV, it will cause tectonic shifts well beyond 8.7 on the Richter scale. We have to evacuate you. Evacuate? That is not possible. There must be an alternative. We will gladly explore the possibility with you. Would you like to come aboard? Our environment is sealed. No one can get in or out. We are capable of matter-energy transport. Matter-energy? We can take you through the structure. Really? That's quite remarkable. May we arrange your transport? No, I must remain here. But under the circumstances, I will permit a small delegation inside the biosphere. If only to see your matter-energy transportation. Very good. Cmdr Riker and team will be with you shortly. This is a mistake. What would you have me do? Anything to keep them out. We have nothing to hide. We have much to lose. What is that? It's them. Look at this, Martin. Incredible. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. It's lovely. I can understand why you're reluctant to leave. Not just reluctant, Miss Troi. It is imperative that we remain. It would be suicide to evacuate. It would destroy what we have worked for two centuries. You see, this is an engineered society. Engineered? Genetically. Our ancestors from Earth came to create a perfect society. They believed through controlled procreation, they could create people without flaws, and those people would build a paradise. All of you have been selectively bred? Your DNA patterns chosen? Eight generations of us. We have immeasurably extended the potential of humanity, physically, psychologically. We have evolved beyond... Beyond... Beyond us? Frankly, yes. No one in this society would be blind. No offence intended. I can see you, sir. Yes. Well, my point... Thank you, Martin. Perhaps you've made it clear there are still a few imperfections. For the most part, we are fully integrated, not just among ourselves but with our environment. We don't just live here. We are a part of our environment. Every plant, microscopic life form is part of the master design. We cannot separate ourselves from it without altering who we are. Your presence has already begun to affect the balance of our society. If we don't survive, the balance of our society won't mean a great deal, will it? I apologize. But he is performing his function as designed to. What function is that? He is the interpreter of our founders' intentions. A judge? More or less. Obviously, he has no diplomatic talents. And obviously you do. I've been bred to fill this specific role. We grow up knowing exactly what our society needs from us. That takes the fun out of it. No. My psychology tells me that I was born to lead. I am what I would choose to be. Think of it another way. Are there still people in your society who have not discovered what to do in life? They may be in the wrong job or writing bad poetry. Or worse, they may be great poets, working as labourers. That does not happen here. It is for us an ideal existence. We will not give it up easily. We will do whatever we can to help you preserve it. Hannah, meet our guests. Yes, from the starship. I've been looking forward to this. Hannah Bates, a scientist. If there's a way, Hannah will find it. She has a remarkable talent with theoretical physics. I've worked up a few schematics based on gravimetric potentials and deflector energy-allocation. Geordi, Troi and I will return to the Enterprise. Contact us. If Mr. Conor doesn't mind, I'd like to see more. No, no. That would be fine. I'd like you to see it. Riker to Enterprise. One to beam up. Acknowledged, Commander. Energize. Are you sure my being here is not going to be disruptive? Disruptive? You mean what Martin was saying? I certainly wouldn't wish to throw off your entire balance. Too late. The damage is done. Seriously. Strict interpreters like Martin can forget we're still human. We'll adjust, accommodate. There must be other unexpected events you have to deal with. An untimely death, an accident. Our geneticists screen out congenital risks before conception. Our population is diverse enough to maintain a genetic balance in the event of accidental death. Very little that is unexpected occurs here. Am I making this sound dull? Not at all. I'll tell you the truth, but don't tell Martin. I've found today exhilarating. Meeting you, meeting new people, with new ideas. I feel the same about being here. I'm a student of human nature. I find this all fascinating. A student of human nature? I'm the ship's counsellor. I'm afraid you wouldn't find much work here. I'd book a vacation at your hotel if you had one. In that case, I shall have them build one. The biosphere won't hold up. The environment would be compromised. That's how I see it. Your ship. What kind of output is it capable of? We have a powerful matter/antimatter warp reaction system. Normally, it kicks plasma up into the terawatt range. Why? Either we're going to have to move or that fragment is. We can move a small moon but a stellar core fragment is much too massive for us. What's that? A wild idea, purely theoretical. A multiphase tractor beam? When we spotted the fragment, I came up with the idea. But we can't generate that kind of energy. You can. We'd need Hannah on board. No. With their equipment, we might alter the fragment's path. It's our only chance to avoid evacuation. No one had ever come here and no one had ever left until today. This is a date to note in our history books. This is in violation of the intentions of our founders. I don't think they intended us to die. Her absence will create an imbalance. Temporarily. Circumstances require us to be flexible. We have no idea how molecular transport will affect her DNA. It won't affect her DNA at all. There's a century of evidence. You can go, Hannah. May I return later? I look forward to it. Enterprise, three to beam up. Energize. Captain's log, supplemental. La Forge and Bates have spent three days trying to adjust the path of the fragment. If they do not succeed in 48 hours, we must evacuate. I believe some will choose to risk death rather than leave, Captain. You've spent time there. How do we change their minds? I'm not sure we can. It would mean abandoning their fundamental way of life. They've managed to turn a dubious scientific endeavour into dogma. You don't approve of genetic engineering? It was a bad idea whose time is past. They've made it succeed. They've given away their humanity with this... genetic manipulation. Many of the qualities that they breed out,... ..uncertainty, self-discovery, the unknown, are many of the qualities that make life worth living. Well, at least, to me. I wouldn't want to live knowing that my future was written, my boundaries had been already set, would you? I've asked myself that a lot during the past few days. I don't know. I doubt it. Nevertheless, it's what they believe in and it won't be easy to talk them into leaving. This leader of theirs, Conor, seems a reasonable man. I find him very reasonable. Open to suggestions, thoughtful, quite disarming. The perfect administrator. I'm sure. Will he leave when he sees there's no other choice? I don't know. I hope so. You admire him? Yes. Then help him to see the reality of what may happen to his colony. If he makes the right decision, if he's as good as he's designed to be, perhaps the others will follow. If we increase warp transfer by 80 percent... It's going to blow the emitters again. We won't be able to hold that power level. It just doesn't work. Yeah. I haven't had any sleep. My eyelids feel like lead weights. Were you always blind? I'm sorry. I probably shocked you. No. I'll put it back on. Don't. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you. I've never been embarrassed by this, Hannah. Never. I was born blind. I've always been this way. May I see your visor? Sure. So, I guess if I had been conceived on your world, I wouldn't be here. No. I'd have been terminated as a fertilized cell. It was the wish of our founders that no one suffer disability. Who gave them the right to decide if I should be here, if I might have something to contribute? I don't know what to say. Here you go. How does it work? The visor scans the spectrum from one hertz to 100,000 terahertz, converts it to usable frequencies and transmits that to my brain. What about the data conversion rates? How do you avoid a sensory overload? A bank of pre-processors compresses the data into pulses. That way, my visual cortex never... Wait a minute. Wait just a minute. We could send a high-energy pulse through the tractor system. Short enough not to overload the emitters. The technology is right here. If we could adapt those pulse-compression routines and apply them to the conduits... We have to avoid tractor-force rebounding. That shouldn't be hard. With a few modifications... That's perfect. What? If the answer is in a visor, created for a blind man, who never would've existed in your society. No offence intended. Please, Matthew, continue. It's hard to believe. So much loveliness here, just metres away from such desolation. It's hard to believe we're about to lose it. This may sound incredibly simplistic, but can't you re-engineer all this on another planet? A nursery rhyme has been in my mind since all this began. A nursery rhyme? Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. All the King's horses and all the King's men couldn't put Humpty together again. Why do we tell children such ghastly stories? Perhaps to prepare them for times like these. We are every bit as fragile as an egg. And as impossible to reconstruct. We are integrated and refined to such a degree any fundamental change would lead to chaos. I'm so sorry, Aaron. I wish I could do something to help. You have helped. You've been wonderful these past few days. You've been my counsellor. No. A counsellor has to maintain a discreet distance. I'd rather think of us as friends. Friends? That won't do, either. Will it? Aaron... I must confess, part of me knows that if I transport through these walls, you'll be on the other side. This is wrong. Terribly wrong. In order to move the fragment, we needed our tractor beam to handle pulses. We needed a more efficient emitter. Four times more. We couldn't get that without overloading the arrays. So, we added a little visor technology and we could boost the force and lower the power-conduit stress levels. The increase in efficiency? Up to almost 300 percent. That's not enough. True. We won't move the fragment far. But if we also fortify the biosphere... With shields like yours it could work. Of course, we have to lend them support crews. Advise Mr. Conor and brief the appropriate officers. Prepare for transport as soon as Mr. Conor approves. You're up early. I'm still on Enterprise time. I'm going back to the ship. I'm not going to see you again. Why? Because it's the right thing to do. I'm not convinced of that. You know it, as well. You're angry. Yes, I'm angry. I'm angry I allowed this to happen. I could fall in love with you so easily. But we both know the end of that story, don't we? How would Martin feel about introducing half-Betazoid DNA into the genetic balance? If we evacuate, anything's possible. Listen to yourself. A few days ago you wouldn't talk to us. This is my fault. I'm so sorry. I need you here. This doesn't have to happen again. I have to go. Good news, Aaron. We can change the course of the fragment. But we need to fortify the structure. And we need help. Engineering crews from the Enterprise will work with your people. Engineering crews? They have to install shield generators and power supplies. 50 officers are waiting for your approval to transport down. We don't have much time. Is there any other choice? None. Enterprise, you may begin transport when ready. Captain's log, supplemental. The Enterprise is on a parallel course with the fragment. We must adjust its trajectory by 1.2 degrees to ensure the colonists' safety. Bring us within range of the fragment, Ensign. You may proceed, Mr. La Forge. Yes, sir. Good luck. You, too. Engage tractor beam. OK. Let's give it a try. Shutting down non-critical systems. Emitter circuits 170 percent over standard. Increasing impulse power to tractor emitters. EPS power-levels rising. Transferring warp power to tractor beam. Graviton generators operating normally. Surge pulse now synchronized. Emitters radiating at 320 percent over standard. Bridge, we need more power. Reduce life support to minimum. Aye, sir. 390 percent over standard. Come on, come on. No change in course. Increase pulse frequency. The circuits won't hold. We don't need them for long. 400 percent over standard. OK. Now we're getting there. Fragment's moved 0.4 degrees off its previous heading. 0.65. It's working. We have lost an emitter circuit. Life-support failure. Decks nine, 12 and 13. Evacuate those decks. Geordi, we're going to need power back soon. Acknowledged. Fragment's new heading adjustment is at 1.01 degrees. Is it enough? Not yet. We've lost a second circuit. Losing life support on decks five through nine. Evacuation initiated. Mr. La Forge. Hold on, Captain. Ship-wide life-support failure in 15 seconds, sir. Almost there. Core shift is at 1.16 degrees. Termination of all life support in five seconds. 1.18. Now, Mr. La Forge. Yes, sir. Shutting down all tractor emissions. Transferring power to life support. 1.2. We've got it! Life support normal on all decks. Mr. Data? The fragment's course has been altered by 1.21 degrees, sir. Hail the colony. Yes, Captain. Success, Mr. Conor. With the upgrades, the fragment should no longer be a danger. I cannot adequately express my appreciation. Can Hannah hear me? Yes. Go ahead, Aaron. An historic achievement. You've done a wonderful thing. Thank you. We look forward to honouring you when you return. Thank you again, Captain. Conor out. Captain's log, supplemental. The fragment has passed out of the Moab System. The colony was shaken but fortunately there were no injuries. Only minor damage was reported. Energize. That should do it. All crew are accounted for. They've been invaluable. Thank you. If there's nothing else, we'll go. Would you tell Deanna Troi that I'm sorry I didn't get the opportunity to say goodbye? I'm sure she is, too. A breach in the biosphere. Get Hannah Bates. The refortification wasn't adequate. There's definite structural damage. The tectonic shifts created a breach. Can it be repaired? I don't know. I'll run a diagnostic. Unless we seal it, we may have to evacuate. How long do we have? With the toxicity outside, hours. Mind if I give her a hand? By all means. Isn't it amazing after all we went through? Yeah. Amazing. Looks bad. It's cracked well beneath the surface. Why are you doing this? What do you mean? There's no breach. What are you talking about? Look at it, it's right here. I measured the toxic leak. You saw me. My visor's positronic scan would have detected the leak. Its molecular-pattern enhancer would pick up even the smallest crack. The damn thing doesn't miss much, does it? Fine. I'll tell them the truth. Will that make you happy? Why are you doing this? I was born to be one of the best scientific minds of my generation. In five days, I have encountered technology I had barely imagined. I've got to ask myself, if we're so brilliant, how come we didn't invent these things? Maybe necessity really is the mother of invention. You never look for something until you need it. But all my needs have been planned for before I was even born. All of us have been living in the Dark Ages. It's like we're victims of a 200-year-old joke. Till you came, all we saw was the wall of our biosphere. Suddenly, our eyes are open to infinite possibilities. Asylum? She wants to leave the colony. She may not be the only one. The science teams fielded a lot of questions from colonists who were curious about what's outside their world. Why shouldn't we grant asylum? We can't. We have to. Do you understand that colony? I understand that these are human beings with free will. She has the right to leave. What happens to the colony if others join her? The society is genetically integrated. There would be gaps. It would destroy them. There must be something we can do. We may have done too much already. We saved them from destruction. Did we? Counsellor, I think it's time you took me to meet Mr. Conor. Transporter room three. Computer, halt. Captain, I have to tell you something. It isn't easy because I've used very poor judgement. I've acted unprofessionally. Counsellor. What is it you say? ""Take a deep breath."" Conor and I have had a relationship. I see. It should never have happened. I knew there was concern about outside influences and... I should have been more careful. What is your status with him now? I did not intend to see him again. Would you prefer not to return? No, I think I should come with you. I wanted you to know before we went. I appreciate that. Computer, resume. I wanted to help him. To be there for him, but the more I was... We all went into this with the best intentions. I should have walked away. But you didn't. And that's human. We make mistakes. Genetic manipulation or not, nobody's perfect. You would ignore the welfare of the colony for your own selfish interests! The welfare of this colony lies in rejoining the human race. She has been contaminated by those people. Mr. Conor, you and I should talk. This is your doing. We never should have answered. If we followed that advice, we'd all be dead. So much for welfare. You will not take her. I'm leaving! A dozen others are ready to go with me. Let's allow Aaron and Capt Picard to discuss this. Why don't we go for a walk? There's nothing else for them to talk about. I think... I want to talk to him alone. But... Thank you, Martin. The irony is, he saw this coming from the moment you arrived. I didn't want to hear, so I chose not to listen. You made decisions you felt would save your colony. No. I wish it were that simple. I'm afraid I can't forgive myself so easily. You see, Captain, I know what Hannah Bates is feeling. I've been feeling it as well. I've found your people as intriguing and stimulating as she has. I've been as curious about you as the next man. But I am not the next man. I am the leader of these people. Every fibre in my being demands that I protect them. Instead, I have betrayed them. I allowed this to happen. We both allowed this to happen. Then let us both find a way to stop it going further. I wish I could see a way. Picard, I was born to govern this colony, not to dismantle it. If you force them to stay, you suppress their human rights. If even a handful leave, the damage will be devastating. What about the rights of those who stay and inherit social chaos, that will follow for generations? Your arrival created this problem. Your departure solves it. That is simplistic. Refuse them passage. I cannot ignore the requests of people, humans, who ask for transport away from here. But thousands will suffer if you agree to take them. As suffering grows, more will demand to leave. We are witnessing the end of this existence. I implore you, Captain, do not let this happen. You would have me make the decision for you, but I can't. I am willing to talk to these people with you. I will urge them not to be impulsive but if finally they choose to leave,... ..the Enterprise will not turn them away. Capt Picard will grant transport to any individuals who wish to leave. I am asking you to stay. Aaron, don't you see we can't be happy here any longer? We were innocent. It will never be that way again. The experience will become part of our heritage. We will adjust. In a few generations... We're not willing to stay a few generations. Alright. Give me six months. Just wait six months. What will that accomplish? It's true that our presence has had an unintended influence on your society. But it's done. There is no way to undo it. But feelings are running very high. Perhaps it's not such a bad idea that you should take time to weigh carefully the consequences of what you're about to do. We are prepared to return in six months. In other words, we are being asked to stay here while they pressure us to change our minds. In five days, you've seen the most superficial evidence of what life is like outside this biosphere. Would you choose this ship in a bottle? You are in command of a starship. You live for the unknown. We ask the same privilege. This is your home. We are all, in a sense, your family. Don't we deserve to open a dialogue on this issue? I am only asking for six months. It won't make any difference. You'll only put the colony through unnecessary pain. You are the ones causing pain in this colony. You. Don't you see? It's over. It's time to lead us into a new era. You could come with us. When you're ready to come home, you will be welcome. What will you do now? Attempt to assess the damage. Spend the rest of my life on the near-impossible task of rebuilding this society without the proper pieces. You acted in the interests of your people. There was no way to avoid what happened. I replay each step, looking for the wrong turn, a mistake in judgement. I can find only one. And as hard as I try, I cannot regret even that one. In fact, I'm quite certain that, given the opportunity,... ..l would choose to make it again. I wonder why, with all these genetically compatible women, I fell in love with you. Don't say that. Perhaps it's your imperfections which make you so unique. But I am in love with you, Deanna Troi. And I will always be. Come. The colonists are on board. How many finally? 23. If ever we needed reminding of the Prime Directive, it is now. The Prime Directive doesn't apply. They're human. Doesn't it? Our very presence may have damaged, even destroyed, their way of life. Whether or not we agree with that way of life, or whether they're human, is irrelevant. We are responsible. We had to respond to the threat of the core fragment. Of course we did. But in the end, we may have proved just as dangerous as any core fragment could ever have been. "
S5E14,"Captain's log, star date 45494.2. We're investigating a series ofsignals that may indicate intelligent life in the Epsilon Silar system. We are within sensor range. The characteristic response to the Kriskov Gambit is the el-Mitra Exchange. Particularly as I have taken both of your rooks. By missing that opportunity, you have left your king vulnerable. We'll see. As you wish, Counsellor. Check. Intriguing. You have devised an unanticipated response to a classic attack. You will checkmate my king in seven moves. Data, chess isn't just a game of ploys and gambits. It's a game of intuition. You are a challenging opponent. Thanks, but don't think a compliment will get you out of our bet. You owe me one Samarian Sunset made in the traditional style... ..as only you can make it, Data. I will honour that. Raise your arm to the side. Is that it? I'm afraid so. What do you think? You tucked when you should have flattened out. Something like that. Turn your head left. Some tearing of the ligaments. Nothing we can't take care of. Good. If I remember correctly, the last time you graced my sickbay, you were diving off the Cliffs of Heaven on Sumiko IV. Holodeck program 47C. Same thing. Only that time I flattened out when I should've tucked. Well, as your doctor, I recommend the Emerald Wading Pool on Cirrus IV. It's a lot safer. Navigators have done assessments the same way for years, Ensign. And I've found a better way. Bridge. Can we discuss changes in procedure before you make them? If I had to ask you... I might have said... No. Yes. Maybe. The point is, I didn't get the chance. The point is, with all due respect, you are trying to turn me into your model officer. The rules do not change just because Ro Laren decides they do. We are picking up a subspace signal, Captain. Sensors indicate a small spacecraft ahead. The configuration is unfamiliar. Nothing in our database. Within visual range. On screen. Analysis, Mr. Worf. No discernible armament. Reading one life form aboard. Hail the vessel. No response. We're being scanned. It's not any system I've seen. Shall we raise shields? No. Let's... Let's begin this with a show of good faith. Sir, the scans match the frequency of our optical-data network. It could be an attempt to access our computer. Scanning intensity has increased by 1500 percent. Shields up. One Samarian Sunset made in the traditional style. It's beautiful. I hope you enjoy it. I hope you enjoy it. The scanning signal has penetrated our shields. Computers are going down. Take evasive action. The helm's not responding. What happened? What the hell...? I don't know who any of you are. Nor do l. I don't... I don't even remember who I am. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Looks like we're all in the same boat. Make that the same starship. But who are we? What are we doing here? It looks like I'm the pilot. We're not going anywhere. The helm's dead. But you still know how to work it. Yes. This console has tactical configuration? Yes. Phaser-power status, intruder scan, torpedo guidance. But they do not appear to be operable. Clearly, we possess certain skills. We know how to operate this ship. But our identities have somehow been erased or... Or suppressed. We are on the bridge. There's a good chance this is our ship. Looks like you're the leader. Do not jump to conclusions. I am decorated as well. It seems to me determining leadership is not crucial now. We need to find out who we are and what we're doing out here. How did this happen? What did this to us? Better still, who did this to us? I've got some intermittent sensor readings here. The scan keeps repeating like it's stuck. But it looks like metallic debris in front of us. Distance, 17 kilometres. The remains of another ship? A good possibility. Perhaps we were engaged in battle. If they stunned us, that could have wiped our memories. Then we fired back, destroyed them. But if that is correct, we could have sustained other damage. Computer, status report. No voice interface. No interface, period. Got something. I've accessed the basic system directories. Can we get a status report? Life-support systems throughout the ship are fully operational. Navigation, propulsion off line. What about communications? Completely disrupted. That rules out a distress signal. If we even knew where to send it. Do we have an on-board communications system? We do now. Let's use it. This ship must have a crew. They may still have their memories. We should be careful. There could be a boarding party. Bridge to all personnel. Select a representative to contact the bridge and report on your status. Remain where you are and stay calm. Bridge out. Well, that helps a lot... Report on our status? I wonder if everyone is in the same condition. This hurts. How's that? Thanks. I didn't even think. I just picked it up and knew how to use it. At least I have an idea of what I'm doing here. But what about me? I mean, I'm a patient in a bathing suit. That doesn't say much. No, it doesn't. Do you have any clothes around here I could borrow? At least until I figure out where the swimming pool is. We've heard from all decks. There are over a thousand people. Everyone's had their memories affected like we have. I have completed a survey of our systems. We are equipped with ten phaser banks, 250 photon torpedoes and a high-capacity shield grid. We're a battleship. It appears so. This turbo lift gives us access to the rest of the ship. The next logical step. Start with the most crucial areas. Main Engineering, deck 36. I'm on my way. Wait a minute. We have to coordinate our efforts. I need to do something. I feel the same. If anything is going to get done... I know, I just... It's an ugly feeling, being so out of control. We have to depend on each other to get through this, OK? We're going to search the ship. Proceed. I'll go with you. I want to use the computer core to re-establish control. I've accessed the optical-data network. I can monitor every system from here. Warp and impulse drives are within tolerance levels. So are the tactical arrays. Everything looks functional now. If we can access the control, we can run it. The Engineering computer-core access is down that corridor. Weapons, propulsion and shields are the priorities in case of attack. That's where I'll start. Begin on decks five through ten. Try to pull up the personnel files. It'd be nice if we all had names. Good luck. You, too. Our survey teams have found no injuries among the crew. Shuttlecraft and transporters are operational. But no one knows anything about their identities. Engineering is working on accessing the control systems. As soon as we are operational, we must be combat-ready. Well, I would recommend that before we prepare for combat, we try to access the ship's logs, find out who we are, what our purpose here might be. I disagree. We must make ourselves ready for battle. That is our priority. Engineering to bridge. Go ahead. I have control of navigation, weapons and communications. We will tie them in a few minutes. Well done. Now we are ready. The question is, for what? The phasers are operational. We now have full tactical control. We should run a complete diagnostic. A full diagnostic would require us to take our systems off line. We would be defenceless. If we are going to trust our lives to these systems, they can't fail. The computer was damaged. Some processors might still be down. Proceed with the diagnostic. What have you found, Doctor? Not much. The brain scans are unusual, but no damage to the hippocampus. That suggests we have our long-term memories. But they're being blocked. Can we bypass the normal pathways? Get at our memories another way? That's what I'm hoping. What I need are normal scans for a comparison. Can I get the crew's medical files? We are running a full diagnostic. Computer resources are limited. Medical records are our next priority. Thank you. I guess these are my quarters but I don't remember anything. We're all in the same situation. Stay put. We'll be in touch. OK, sir. Thanks. That's all I need for now. Well, that's it for living quarters on this deck. What's next? There's a large room ahead called ten-forward. Let's go. If everything was as it should be, what would you be doing now? I'd be having more fun than searching this ship. Fun? That holodeck we just saw. I think I could conjure up an interesting program. That's disappointing. Why? You don't strike me as a man who needs a holodeck to have a good time. Who reported to the bridge? I did. Have you found out anything? Not specifically, but there are two things that seem unusual. The bartender is an artificial life form. Can I get you something? A beverage? No, thank you. I'm fine. Your memories are gone? The data banks that identify who I am are not functioning. Something else? I don't know what it means. I seem to have an ability that the others don't. I have a very strong sense of what other people are feeling. At times, it's almost... Is something wrong? No. Just for a moment, you seemed familiar. You remember me? Not exactly. I mean, I don't know who you are, but there's something about you. Bridge to survey team. Go ahead. We have accessed the personnel files. Report to the bridge. We're on our way. Give me a biographical listing of all personnel responsible for the ship's primary operation. A full listing is not available. Is there any list of the ship's senior officers? The crew manifest is available. It's better than nothing. Commanding Officer, Capt Jean-Luc Picard. Executive Officer, Cmdr Keiran MacDuff. Second Officer, Cmdr William Riker. Operations Officer, Lt Cmdr Data. Chief Medical Officer, Dr Beverly Crusher. Ship's Counsellor, Lt Cmdr Deanna Troi. Chief Engineer, Lt Cmdr Geordi La Forge. Security Chief, Lt Worf. Helm Officer, Ensign Ro Laren. Cmdr MacDuff, have the other officers report to the bridge. Aye, sir. Your next priority is to retrieve any information about our mission. Contact the Operations Officer to assist you. He's in ten-forward, waiting tables. Captain. I regret my recent behaviour. I assumed an attitude of authority that was unwarranted. Mr. Worf, we're all doing the best we can. Think nothing more of it. Thank you, Captain. We haven't finished but we have found out a bit. This vessel is the Enterprise. We are part of the United Federation of Planets. The Federation is at war. With whom? The Lysian Alliance, a genocidal race determined to destroy us. The war has gone on for years. Starfleet Command believes the Lysians have a new weapon which has shifted the balance to their favour. Over the last two months, 14 Federation vessels have been captured, easily, their crews held on Lysia. What is this weapon? Our scientists theorize they are using an energy wave, either plasma-based or a subspace interference pattern. The weapon disrupts a starship's computer system and the mental functions of its crew. That's what happened to us. Do we have any record of our current mission? Yes, sir. We are approximately here. We've been ordered into Lysian territory to destroy their command. This is it. The nerve centre for the Lysian military operation. Captain, there's been damage to our computer system. Maybe we don't have the correct information. What are you saying? That we get confirmation of this mission from headquarters. If we use subspace radio, we will be detected. There may be thousands of lives at stake. Our orders require us to maintain radio silence. Our mission is part of an effort to end the war. There are other vessels on other fronts, all working to a plan. We're the lynchpin to the operation. If we don't destroy their command, the effort fails. He's right. Our choice is clear. Cmdr MacDuff, set a course for the Lysian central command. These are your quarters. Thanks for your help. Come in for a minute? Recognize anything? It's like it belongs to someone else. Nothing feels right. This room, this ship... Most of all, this war we're fighting. I don't imagine war ever feels right. I suppose that's true. What is it? That same feeling. You seem familiar. You're the only thing that does. Can you remember anything specific about us? I don't know. It's more like remembering an emotion, feelings that you're somehow associated with. I hope they're good feelings. Yes, they are. This entire situation is a little bit unnerving. It's been a long day. We've been through a lot. We certainly have. I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight. Hi. I didn't get the wrong room. I didn't like the way my quarters were decorated. Besides, I have a feeling I spend most of my off hours here. Really? For all we know, you and I could be married. For all we know, you and I could hate each other. Sort of exciting, isn't it? We just don't know. We might regret this. Regret what? Aren't you being presumptuous? Like I said, I didn't like the way my quarters were decorated. Maybe we should switch quarters. Maybe we should stay here and see what happens. What if I snore in my sleep? What makes you think you're gonna get any sleep? We have crossed the Lysian border. Take us out of warp. Three-quarters impulse. Maintain a sensor sweep. Aye, sir. How long till their central command? At our current speed, 37 hours. Captain, I am picking up a vessel ahead. Can you identify it? The ship matches the description of a Lysian destroyer. A short-range attack vessel with disruptor weapons and a crew of 53. Within visual range. On screen. The destroyer is increasing speed to intercept. Evasive sequence delta. Yes, sir. They are matching our manoeuvres. Activating phaser arrays. Ready to fire, sir. Stand by. Captain, our orders were to destroy all Lysian warships. I'm aware of that, Commander. Tactical analysis, Mr. Data? The destroyer has minimal shields. Their disruptor capacity is only 2.1 megajoules. No match for the Enterprise. Captain. The destroyer is hailing us. Open a channel. No. Their new weapon, whatever erased our memories, maybe they do it over communication channels. It is conceivable, sir. It's also possible they just want to talk to us. I think we should respond. The ship is hailing us. If you're wrong, it could mean our destruction. The Lysians have stopped transmitting. They have powered up their disruptors. They have locked onto us. Full shields. Shields up. Captain? Return fire. The ship has been destroyed. Maintain course, Ensign. Three-quarters impulse. Yes, sir. Well done, Captain. The Lysians would have received any transmission by now. They will be on alert. I recommend a randomly vectored approach. It's our best chance of avoiding any pursuit. Agreed. Success would be more likely if we had our memories. Anything you can do? I found several cases resembling this in the medical index. The causes are different but the cure is similar in each case. Could it work for us? That's what I'm hoping. It involves increasing the activity of the medial-temporal region using short-term synapses to retrieve long-term memory. When can you start? When our files become available. It would be dangerous without them. Mr. La Forge? Data and I ran into trouble accessing the medical files but with time we'll get there. Three hours, maximum. Proceed. I don't get it. I'm still hitting a file wall. There appears to be a command-path discontinuity. I shall attempt to rewrite the locator subroutine. You must have been some bartender. Too bad there aren't more of you. Yes. I wonder why you're the only one on board. I have expended considerable thought with respect to my apparent uniqueness. Any conclusions? Several possibilities suggest themselves. I may represent an entire race of artificial life forms. If so, there may be a home planet. A shared history and culture of which I am not aware. Or you could have been built for this ship. I have considered that. It may be the case that every starship is equipped with an artificial life form. If that's true, maybe you all look alike. A standard-issue android. There is another possibility. Perhaps my origin is unique. In that case, I am alone. We have accessed the information-storage area. The files are damaged. The mission reports are gone. As well as the crew records and the personal logs. So are the medical records. Come in. I'm restless. Mind if I visit for a while? Please. What's wrong? Everything. Every time I think about this war, our mission, I feel panic, like a hand closing around my throat. You're never gonna feel good about this war. But we must complete our mission. I've been doing a little research about William T Riker. What have you discovered? He's a musician. Very impressive. No one was more surprised than l. What else has your research uncovered? He's athletically inclined, loves to climb mountains. He's from somewhere called Alaska. He enjoys exotic food, and takes his vacations on a planet called Risa. Ode to Psyche by John Keats. Open it. ""To Will, all my love, Deanna."" That may explain some of the familiar feelings we have. I don't know what to think. Come in. Counsellor. Ensign. Am I interrupting anything? No. No. I was just visiting. We'll talk again soon, Commander. Of course. Thank you, Counsellor. Bye. And what was all of that about? We were just discussing the situation we're in. Good. Because I have a feeling that I used to be the jealous type. What bothers me is how specific this damage is. Any records of a personal nature, about who we are, those are gone. It's too selective. As selective as what was done to our memories. Skills are in place, but not personal knowledge. It is consistent with the Lysian weapon. Do we need to see the medical files to attempt treatment? It would be dangerous without them. It's a risk we have to take. He's right. I volunteer for the procedure. That's strange. The diencephalic activity is exactly the same. There should be some increase. Let's broaden the bandwidth. Go to 30.1. Raise the frequency as well. Increase it by 33 percent. Something's wrong with the sequencing program. Keiran. I'm alright. What happened? I don't know. Something went wrong with the sequence initiator. We're lucky we didn't lose you. Did any of this work? Do you remember anything more? No, I'm sorry, Doctor. Back to square one. Come. You wanted to see me, Captain? Yes. Please, sit down. I find myself having grave concerns about our mission. Concerns? As to its success? No, no. More fundamental doubts. Whether or not it can be justified. I've asked myself the same thing. I'm sure our superiors feel their orders are justified. Orders we can't even verify. Orders we can't ignore. But I also can't ignore that we have greatly outclassed the one enemy vessel we've encountered, and that every single possible shred of information which might shed light on this situation has been eliminated. I feel as though I've been handed a weapon, sent into a room and told to shoot a stranger. Well, I need some moral context to justify that action. And I don't have it. I'm not content to obey orders. I need to know that what I'm doing is right. So do l. I'd feel better if all the questions were answered. If you want to abandon our mission, that's your choice, but... I must ask you, is it right to risk prolonging this war, to allow the deaths of thousands on both sides on the basis of our moral discomfort? Come. Lieutenant. You wished to see me, sir? I did. Please. Memory or no, it seems clear that you and I were born for battle. More so than the others. I thought this as well. It's conceivable that is why we have been assigned to this vessel. The Enterprise has science officers, medical specialists, engineers. Our Captain is undoubtedly an accomplished diplomat. But we are the warriors. There are times for diplomacy. This is not one of them. You're concerned about the Captain? I am concerned about completing our mission, ending this war. In victory. We may soon face a critical moment. The success of our mission may hang on a split-second decision. A hesitation would kill us all. Those that are counting on us would die as well. We cannot let this happen. That'll be all. We are entering the Lysian system. Slow to one-quarter impulse. Yes, sir. The central command is still beyond weapon range. Red alert. Battle stations. Bring us to an attack posture, Mr. Worf. Sensors show several objects, 29 metres in length and unmanned. According to Starfleet records, they are sentry pods. I read 47 of them. Tactical analysis, Mr. Data? The pods have fusion-generated pulse lasers and minimal shielding. Not much power. Forward shields to maximum. Lock phasers on the sentry pods. Prepare to return fire. Shields up. Phasers locked on targets. Full impulse. Take us straight through. We are through, sir. That was too easy. We have yet to encounter any battleships. They may lie ahead. Load all torpedo bays. Ready phasers. Aye, sir. Approaching central command. Mr. Data, scan for defences. I'm picking up no vessels, no sentry pods. Optimal firing range in 55 seconds. Phaser banks ready. Loading torpedoes. What are the defensive capabilities of the command? Armaments consist of four laser cannons and 39 cobalt-fusion warheads with magnetic propulsion. Defensive-shield output is 4.3 kilojoules. One photon torpedo ought to do it. How many people are there? 15,311. We're within range, Captain. Stand by. Waiting on your orders, sir. Captain, this isn't right. The rest of our forces depend on us. How can our mortal enemy be 100 years behind us in technology? Their battleships may be on their way. We must attack. I do not fire on defenceless people. Mr. Worf, open a channel. Belay that order. There is something wrong with the Captain. Fire all weapons! Mr. Worf! Captain's log, supplemental. We are on course to Star base 301. Dr Crusher has restored the memories of most of the crew. The Lysians have identified Cmdr MacDuff as a Satarran, an alien race that's been at war with the Lysians for decades. I have conveyed our deepest regrets to the Lysians over the tragedy of their lost ship and crew. With all the power MacDuff had to alter our brain chemistry and manipulate the computers, it's hard to believe he needed us. The Satarrans' weapons are no more advanced than the Lysians'. One photon torpedo would have ended their war. It almost did. I hope I'm not interrupting. No. No. I was hoping to run into you. Please, sit down. Well, I'm glad I ran into the two of you. When you have no memory of who you are, you find yourself... The Counsellor tells me that at times like that, we might do the things that we've always wanted to do. She said that? It's psychologically valid. Commander, don't worry about it. As far as I'm concerned, you and I shared something that we will treasure forever. Well, I'm a little confused. Well, if you're still confused tomorrow, you know where my office is. "
S5E15,"Captain's log, star date 45571.2. We are going into orbit around an unexplored M-Class moon of Mab-Bu VI. Though it is reported uninhabited, we have picked up a distress call. The electromagnetic whirlwinds make it hard to locate the source of the signal. Any indications of life? Scanners read negative. But there is interference. Have you ever heard anything similar? I believe so. At Starfleet Academy. The Academy? I will verify it. As I thought. It is a Starfleet subspace distress signal, standard to Daedalus-class starships. They haven't been in service for... what? 172 years, sir. Any records of missing ships in this vicinity? The USS Essex, under Capt Bryce Shumar, disappeared in this sector over two centuries ago. Daedalus-class. I have accessed the transponder signature of the Essex. It is identical to the signal from the moon. We arrived a little late! Mute it, Mr. Data. With the storms, it isn't worth the risk to check on a ghost ship. Advise Starfleet we have solved the mystery of the Essex. I'm not sure we have. Someone's down there. Alive. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. First Officer's log, supplemental. The interference is too dangerous for anyone to transport down. So we have taken a shuttle to investigate. Shields are holding. Wind shear is incredible. Data, keep an eye on the stabilizers. If it's like this on the ground, how can people survive? Maybe they live underground. Where? I still can't locate the source of the signal. It's bouncing around more than we are. Thrusters have failed. We are losing power. Enterprise! Go ahead. We've lost our thrusters. Attempting to use boosters. Their impulse generators have shut down. Can you hear me? Enterprise to shuttle. Please respond. Hold on! We're going down. Initiating emergency landing. Maintain the approach attitude. I'm taking her in. Brace for impact! The shuttle has crashed. Position? I have the trace signature, but the interference is distorting its position. Can you locate them? I think I can. I followed their entry. We can calculate coordinates from the angle of descent. Your arm. Pretty sure that's broken. Enterprise! It is unlikely we will be able to establish communication. We'll stay in the area until they find us. Take an inventory of the shuttle. See if there's anything usable. The ground cover is nonporous rock. It's even less likely anyone's living here. There are no instruments left that have not been damaged. What is that? It's not like any storm front I've ever seen. High levels of EM bursts across the spectrum. No life signs other than our own. There is someone alive here. I'm certain. I hope they can find us. There's no way we'll find them. They're coming. They're coming with the storm. We can't get a lock on them because of the EM bursts. There's no way we can beam them out in these conditions. Those conditions stop a shuttle landing safely. Any suggestions? Give us a minute. Let me beam down with a pattern enhancer. You could rematerialize in a million pieces in that whirlwind. I can boost the confinement beam. One person might be able to make it. O'Brien wants to beam down with a pattern enhancer. His chances of making it down there safely are no better than 50%50. A major storm front is moving in on their coordinates. You know the risks, Mr. O'Brien? Yes, sir. I think I can make it. Alright, then. Good luck. Aye, sir. Mr. O'Brien! Nice of you to join us. Nice spot for a picnic, sir. We need to distribute these enhancer rods at seven-meter lengths. That should do it. Will this storm front interfere with the transport? I'd really like to get out before it hits. I'm meant to feed the baby lunch. Molly gets in a foul mood if I'm late. I'm with you! Lunchtime, Miles. Let's do it. Easy, Deanna. Where...? On the Enterprise. You're OK. My skin's tingling. It's the after-images of the electromagnetic discharge. The sensation will pass. They're all fine, too. Now, take your time, Counsellor. Doctor's orders. Injury report, Doctor. Mostly minor abrasions. Cmdr Riker took the worst of it. A broken arm. Mr. Data. Good work, Chief. Thank you, sir. Ready for duty, sir. Sure, Number One? It's not my first broken bone. And how are you, Counsellor? Very glad to be here. Good. Let's go. So what happened? That storm moved in faster than anything I've seen. Any evidence of life? No, but if Troi was right, we were close to it. Bridge. How do you suggest we proceed? We need to adjust the scanner to penetrate the storms. Any ideas, Data? We can employ virtual imaging to interpolate missing data. Something wrong, Commander? My apologies, sir. It seems my speech processes are experiencing a minor fluctuation. I will correct it in a moment. Captain, may I speak with you for a moment in private? You have the bridge, Number One. Mr. Data, deploy sensor scans. Take us to a synchronous orbit aligned around our crash site. Sir, given the EM-field properties of this moon, I recommend a search pattern beginning in the southern polar region. The polar region? That would be starting from scratch. Readings suggest that we begin our scan around our crash site. The Essex's signal was never clearly located. A survey of the moon from a polar orbit might be more practical. You may be right. But I'd like to give the crash site a once-over first. Maintain our current orbit. Understood, sir. I've never felt anything like it. It was as if they were calling to me. Someone was communicating telepathically? Perhaps. For an instant. It was like their voices were being carried on the wind. What were they trying to communicate? I'm not sure. But they were calling me to the southern polar region. I believe that's where we should look for the Essex. Commander, did you override my orbital heading? Override? We've moved into a polar orbit. I'm locked out. Helm isn't responding. Do you know anything about this, Mr. Data? Data? Security to the bridge! Computer, transfer command to Engineering. This way. What happened? He would not change course. The Captain would have done it for me. Deck 36, Engineering. Computer, re-enable bridge control. Security protocol. Authorization, Riker Omega three. Report. Data, O'Brien and Troi tried to take over the ship. They're in turbo lift four. Engaging override now. They've trapped us. What deck is this? Deck ten. Can you move us again? I can override bridge command. Activate security fields. Sir, the turbo lift is moving again. They're still inside. Initiate emergency bulkheads in turbo shaft four. They have been stopped at deck 13. Mr. Worf. Can you deactivate this? We can't override an emergency force-field command. My entity's artificial substructure may be useful. They've broken through the security field. Deck ten. Security to ten-forward. Momma's here. Everyone, get down on the floor. Miles? On the floor! Everyone, down, now! Miles! Multiple phaser shots, ten-forward. Picard to Worf. Report. Mr. Worf, acknowledge. Can you hear me, Mr. Worf? Yes, bridge. He can hear you. Captain's log, supplemental. Following an aborted attempt to take over the bridge, Troi, Data and O'Brien have seized ten-forward. Security teams at both entrances. Yes, sir. Shut down computer access to ten-forward. I can't. They've set up a remote security lockout. We'd have to shut down the saucer. Transporter room three, can you get a lock on Data, Troi and O'Brien? Attempting to lock on, sir. They're attempting to engage the transporters. I know how to shut them down. Do it. Bridge, the transporter array is in a diagnostic mode. I can't override. It'll take a few hours to complete. How many people are down there? 17. They just shut down internal scanners, too. Dr Crusher to the bridge. On my way. What are you doing? Reversing the force fields to isolate this room. Good. Their communicators. Now they'll learn nothing except what we tell them. They've done something to the force fields. Geordi? They've completely isolated ten-forward. How about using anaesthezine gas? That won't affect Data. We have to knock out all three. A concussive charge would blow out the security fields. We could go in and stun everybody. Doctor, check the biofilter readouts of the away team's transport. See if you can come up with any clue to explain this. Ten-forward, this is Capt Picard. I will discuss this situation. There is no need for further violence. Please, identify yourselves. They will attempt to negotiate the safety and release of their people. Interesting. Under normal circumstances, I would be counselling the Captain. What would you tell him to do? I would help him find a way to secure our trust. What are you looking at? You, Klingon. Attack me. Are you afraid? I have no fear of death. And I have no fear of killing you. Stop it! Please respond, ten-forward. Do any of my crew require medical assistance? We can discuss your wounded. But first, you will move the ship. Move it where? Change orbit to an inclination of 80 degrees south. The southern polar region, where Data tried to move the ship. That's what Troi asked me to do. But why? Ten-forward, if you could be more specific about our destination... You have 30 seconds to change your heading, or additional members of your crew will require medical attention. We need to stabilize this situation. Play for time. I suggest that we move the ship as they've asked. Agreed? Set a new heading, but take us there as slowly as you can. Ten-forward, we are moving the ship as you requested. He's telling the truth. Their heading has changed. I compared the away team's last transporter patterns to their earlier records. They're exactly the same, except in Data, Troi and O'Brien there's unusual synaptic activity. Anionic energy. It might be a life form superimposing its neural patterns. Why wasn't I affected? I don't know. The only difference is that you were injured. My broken arm. It caused pain receptors to fire. It may have made you immune to this energy. What would happen if we were to inflict pain on the others? It might force whatever it is out of them. A plasma shock would be painful, but wouldn't harm them. I could hook up a laser to a plasma inverter. What about Data? It will definitely overload his neural net. It'll work on him. We have to penetrate the force field. I could interrupt it for a few seconds, but timing would be critical. We have to hit all three with one discharge. If they're together, it'll be fine. How will you gain access? A micro-optic drill through the ceiling. We have to have some way to contain or neutralize this anionic energy once it's out of our people. Yes, Doctor, that will be your top priority. Proceed. Bridge to ten-forward, now that we are moving the ship, I want to know the nature of the injuries to my crew. Five of your people are injured. How serious is their condition? You, Klingon, tell him. One person has what looks like a level-five phaser hit. Four have secondary burns. They require medical attention. Our captors are not affected... Silence, Klingon! Ten-forward, you must release these people for medical attention. I will release no one. If you will release them, I will take their place. I don't trust him. It may be a deception. The crew values Picard's life above all others. Capt Picard, we agree to your proposal. Expect a Medical team. Acknowledged. Sickbay, have an emergency Medical team outside ten-forward. Putting you there strengthens their position. While they're on board this ship, I'm a hostage. We all are. We must find out who we're dealing with. If La Forge and Ro can attempt a rescue, let them proceed. If they can't, I will provide you with an opportunity. Watch for it. Yes, sir. Silence that child! I know you. I know who you are. And I know what this is. She's frightened! Why don't you just let us go? No. Make it stop! Ten-forward, we're outside the door. Lower the force field. Welcome, Captain. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Capt Bryce Shumar of the Federation Starship Essex. The Essex vanished over 200 years ago. Indeed. I know. I was there. This is my first officer, Cmdr Steven Mullen. And my security chief, Lt Morgan Kelly. And you have survived all this time as...? Spirits? Ghosts? But you're a man who would never believe in ghosts. Isn't that true? You see, Troi knows you. And so I do as well. Then Counsellor Troi is still alive? Of course she is. I have no wish to harm her or to harm anyone else. I'm pleased to hear that. We have been forced to take this action because we need your help. My help? Our consciousness has been trapped on this moon for two centuries. We must escape this torture. How did this happen to you? I can't explain how it happened. I only know that it did. The Essex was caught in an electromagnetic storm, just as your shuttle was. Moments before we crashed, the bridge was struck by lightning. The ship was ripped apart. Somehow, in that instant, our consciousness was absorbed into the magnetic currents on the surface. Why didn't you tell us this? Why the deception? The violence? Because, as I said, I knew you would not believe us. Even now, I know you don't. What was your vessel's designation and complement? NCC-173. Daedalus-class starship. Crew, 229. Under whose command? Admiral Uttan Narsu. Star base 12. You will find all this in Starfleet records. I don't need to see the records. Then you know I am correct. End this, and I will give you whatever help you need. No. You don't trust us. And I can't risk trusting you. It's taking too long. We should have been there by now. He is manipulating you. Capt Picard has every right to be curious. He will delay until a rescue is possible. I know that. I also know he will make every effort to protect the lives of his people. Since our demands are not excessive, Captain, I hope you will see that it will be simpler to accede than to risk further injuries. What do you want? All you need to know for now is that we want to rest. Simply, finally, to rest. Section two. B. A. Section one. Finally! I never want to see this part of the Enterprise again. I hear you. This is what starship designers call ""easy access"". Yeah. Yeah, this is it. I thought we might have a problem with conduit number 227, but it looks like we're gonna be able to get by it. Thanks. We're through. Good. Let's hook up the scanner and see what we've got. Got it. All three have to be in the circle for this to work. We're halfway home. La Forge to Crusher, how are you doing? I have an idea for a containment field. This anionic energy seems vulnerable to the magnetic-flux density in the storms. If we can duplicate it, we can trap it. You could flood ten-forward with ionogenic particles. Exactly what I was thinking. How long will it take to get it all ready? We still have to calibrate the plasma invert. My guess is 45 minutes to an hour. The containment field will be ready. Keep me advised. Impressions, Mr. Worf. Spiritual possessions have been reported throughout Klingon history. It is called Jat'yln, the taking of the living by the dead. Human history is full of many similar legends. Then you believe they may be telling the truth? Not for one moment. They know much about the Essex. If it is the spirit of Capt Shumar... Then he should be behaving very much better. A Starfleet captain. You two, sit down. Living disembodied for two centuries. Perhaps they've gone mad. I assure you, Mr. Worf, these are not Jat'yln. Our job is to find out exactly what they are, and how to deal... Right, that's enough. Sit down. You, over there. You, there. Down! I gave you that. In a place called McKinley Park. Green grass. Tall trees. Please don't. I hid the bracelet in your pocket. You were surprised. Don't! You said, ""Miles, you make me feel so happy."" No! Get away from me! Leave her alone. Capt Shumar. We're approaching the southern polar region. I need to give instructions. Very well. We're taking you to our crash site. The southern pole? That is correct. Nothing our sensors could detect indicated the Essex went down there. As I told you, Captain, the ship broke up in the atmosphere, and the bridge went down here. When we reach it, you will beam what's left of our skeletal remains on board, and then take them back to Earth for a proper burial. You see how simple a request this is? Captain,... ..if you will let these people go, I'll order the bridge to follow your instructions. I will release no one. If you are who you say you are, there's no need for this. We'll gladly take you home. I wish you were truly as open-minded as you say, Picard. Release the hostages or I won't cooperate. You'll cooperate, Captain. You will cooperate, or someone will die. Who shall it be? How about the Klingon? Get another one. You. Come on. Pick one to die, Captain, or I kill them both. They're all in range. I have to do it now. I can only shut down the force field for seven seconds. If they're the right seven seconds, it'll be enough. Prepare to release the ionogenic field. Standing by. Ready? Lower force field. Force field down. Firing plasma charge. Damn! Tell them to stop, or I kill everyone in this room, starting with you. Picard to bridge, abort immediately. As you say, Captain. Riker to La Forge, return to the bridge. Are you ready to cooperate? Yes. First Officer's log, supplemental. The Enterprise is in orbit near the southern polar region. We await further instructions. Any sign of the Essex? Negative. Electromagnetic disturbances are even worse here. Bridge to ten-forward. Intense storm activity makes it virtually impossible for us to pick up any trace of the Essex. We are giving you the exact coordinates of our remains on board the Essex. I'm receiving those coordinates now. Can you tell what's there? Just your basic ionic cyclone. I can't read a thing. I'm not beaming up whatever might be down there. You've got a good excuse. Transporters wouldn't work. Bridge to ten-forward. Whatever's blocking our scanners will block the transporters. They're lying! We've had difficulties with the transporters. That's why we sent the shuttle. You should know. We have to use the transporters. Mr. O'Brien safely executed the return of the away team. He's the most qualified person to operate the transporters. Can you do it from here? No. I need a transporter pad. I could give you safe passage to a transporter pad in a cargo bay. It is a trick. He is trying to divide us. We must not be separated. I can give you all safe passage. Why are you suddenly so helpful? I assume that if you choose to go to the cargo bay, then you won't take all the hostages. Their safety is my priority. What are the risks when we leave this room? Without the force fields, we are vulnerable. They could use the transporter. They could beam us to the surface. But there is a way to neutralize that threat. Bridge, transfer all transporter functions to ten-forward. In order to do that, you will have to release your computer lockouts. That's not true. Let me talk to him. Number One, I think we have an opportunity to end this siege. It will require the cooperation of all concerned. Our guests will be moving shortly to cargo bay four, from where the transport will occur. I want you to ensure them of safe passage between ten-forward and the cargo bay. Understood, Captain. Doctor. Mr. La Forge. Yes, sir. Transporter controls are being transferred. Ten-forward to bridge. I said all transporter controls! Including all those aboard your shuttlecraft. Almost had them, Ensign. Nice try. Riker to ten-forward. Remaining transporter functions transferred. Once we create our own access code, no one can use the transporter against us. What about the weapons? We will each take a hostage. For protection. Klingon. Picard, you are mine. Please let her stay. Lower the force field. Security teams, stand by. They're in section five. They'll be at their destination in less than a minute. They stopped at deck 18. Security, allow them access to cargo bay four. I will require assistance. Capt Shumar, how do you intend to achieve this rest that you so desire? What do you mean? How do you intend to free yourselves of this existence that has so trapped your consciousness? It will fade as we move from this planet. Really? What is your scientific basis for that? I don't need a scientific basis. Just be quiet. When are you going to tell me who you really are? I've initialized the transporter signal. Proceed. They're firing up the transporter. Mr. La Forge? I've isolated cargo bay four with a neutrino field. It will only take Data and O'Brien a few minutes to override it. I hope it gives the Captain enough time. Do you know what he'll do? There's only one reason he chose cargo bay four. If it becomes necessary, you'll blow the cargo bay hatch on my orders. Yes, sir. You're right, Picard. It's not rest we seek, only escape. Escape? We were brought to this moon over five centuries ago, from a star system called Ux-Mal. We were separated from our bodies and left to drift in the storms. Once we almost escaped, on board the Essex. But that ship could not elude this moon's electromagnetic storms. You thought using their identities would gain our sympathy? It was better than asking you to allow hundreds of condemned prisoners on board. Then this moon is a penal colony. That's correct. But now we have your ship and your bodies to carry us home. I'm reading dozens of them. Hundreds. They have the same anionic signature we saw on the biophoto scans. We can give the Captain a new bargaining chip. Dr Crusher, flood the cargo bay with your containment field. No! Let them go or you will all die! Your threats are meaningless. We are still in control of these three bodies. Will you sacrifice the others? They will die when the hatch is blown. You will die too, Picard. I would die to save my child. To die defending one's ship is the hope of every Klingon. If you each know the officers you inhabit, then you know they would give their lives for this ship. Free them now and I will return you to the moon's surface. I advise you, Picard, not to pass our way again. Picard to bridge. Our guests are leaving shortly. I need an emergency Medical team. On our way. Mr. Worf, prepare to transport these prisoners down to the moon's surface. Gladly, sir. Captain's log, star date 45572. 1. Dr Crusher has examined Troi, Data and O'Brien. There seem to be no residual effects. It was as if my own consciousness were pushed to the side. I watched everything, heard my voice, but wasn't able to control it. The entity that controlled you, what were your perceptions? He was intelligent, actually. Thoughtful, in a ruthless kind of way. Cold. I must apologize for my inadvertent misconduct. No apology necessary. Your restraint was most remarkable. You have no idea. How do you feel? Hungry. That's a good sign. Go home. How do you feel? I'm just glad to have you back. If I could have killed that thing inside me, I would have. I know. We both know. "
S5E16,"No question about it, she was bluffing, Worf. Bluffing is not one of Counsellor Troi's strong suits. I'm reading chlorinide leakage, but I can't pin it down. Maybe up here. It would have been unwise to call. Yes. My hand was not strong enough. You had jacks and eights, she bluffed with a pair of sixes. How did you know what I had? Let's just say I had a special insight into the cards. Next time, bring a deck that's not transparent to infrared light. Not to worry, Worf, I only peak after the hand is over. Still nothing. I'll get a dynoscan. We'll try again. Commander, is that what you wanted? Yes. If anything changes, tell me. Ensign, run a dynoscan. Look out! Worf! What happened? La Forge to sickbay. Medical emergency in cargo bay three. What happened? The containers you were checking fell on you. You're lucky to be alive. Doctor, I will not attempt to leave sickbay without your approval. The restraining field is not necessary. Worf, there is no restraining field. But I can't move my legs. I know. You can't move because a container shattered seven of your vertebrae and crushed your spinal cord. I'm afraid there's no way we can repair this kind of injury. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, star date 45587.3 Lt Worf has been removed from active duty following a severe injury. Although a neuro-specialist has arrived, Dr Crusher believes his paralysis may be permanent. Welcome, Dr Russell. I'm Beverly Crusher. A pleasure. I have equipment on the Potemkin. Can you send it to your labs? Send it to med lab four. Yes. Before we get down to business, I had the pleasure of reading your paper on cybernetic regeneration. Really? You're the first to mention it. I thought it was brilliant. Your ideas on bio-active interfaces border on revolutionary. It will be a pleasure working with you. Thank you. Have you had a chance to review Worf's case yet? Only briefly. I was shocked to find the state of Klingon neurological medicine so primitive. It's a cultural bias. The Klingon Medical Division informed me they usually let the patient die in a case like this. They've done no research on neurological trauma. We'll be in uncharted waters. Worf is having a hard time. He's always been a difficult patient, but now... He's tough at first, but you'll like him... I know that as a starship doctor, you have to maintain close ties with patients. But it will be best if I maintain a discreet distance. That way, I can give an objective opinion regarding treatment. Yes. You're probably right. Good. Well, I believe you said I'd be working in med lab four? Right this way. You look good for somebody who's eaten sickbay food for three days. Please, sit down, Commander. Thank you for agreeing to see me in this condition. I'm not a Klingon. There's no shame in being injured. I am not merely injured, Commander. Dr Crusher believes my paralysis to be permanent. I'm sorry. I have a personal favour to ask. Name it. I want you to help me perform the Hegh'bat ceremony. I want you to help me die. What? When a Klingon can no longer stand and face his enemies as a warrior, when he becomes a burden to friends and family, it is time for the Hegh'bat. Time for him to die. There must be other options. No. There are not. I will not live as an object of pity or shame. My life as a Klingon is over. Mr. Worf,... ..l will not help a friend commit suicide. You and I have served together for many years. Fought side by side. I know you to be a brave and honourable man. If you truly consider me a friend, help me now. Help me end my life as I have lived it, with dignity and honour. Please. The spinal tract has deteriorated over the last 72 hours despite CPK enzymatic therapy. What about alkysine treatment? Ineffective. Over-designed. Klingon anatomy. 23 ribs, two livers, eight-chambered heart, double-lined neural pia mater. I've never seen so many unnecessary redundancies. Unnecessary? The Klingons refer to it as the brak'lul. Almost every vital function in their bodies has a built-in redundancy in case any primary organ or system fails. It's a good design in theory, but in practice the extra organs are just that much more to go wrong. Let me show you something. I've been experimenting with DNA-based generators. This is a genetronic replicator. It reads the DNA coding of damaged organs, translates that into a specific set of replicant instructions, and then begins to grow a replacement. I've read of your preliminary work. The early results have been very encouraging. Beverly, the genetronic replicator can create a completely new neural conduit for your Lt Worf. Replace his entire spine? Exactly. Instead of pasting together broken connections like a couple of glorified tailors, we create a new living system. I had no idea you were using this on humanoids. I haven't been. This will be the first time. First time? I've done dozens of holo-simulations. The success rate is up to 37 percent. Even a holographic patient would balk at those odds. Sooner or later it has to be tried on a living patient. You're talking about a spinal column. Even before we could replace it, we have to remove the existing one. We don't know enough about Klingon medicine to reattach it. If something goes wrong, he'll die. I agree it has remarkable potential, but you're still in the most preliminary stages of research. No, I can't justify the risk to Worf. We'll have to use more conventional approaches. Dr Crusher, report to the bridge. On my way. The transport ship Denver struck a gravitic mine. They've sustained damage. They attempted to crash-land on a planet in the Mericor system. We'll arrive in seven hours. How many were aboard? The Denver's crew complement is 23, but they were transporting 517 colonists to the Beloti Sector. Convert all shuttle bays into emergency triage centres. Civilians with medical training report for duty. Make it so. May I speak to you in private? Yes. You have the bridge, Mr. Data. Aye, sir. I have always tried to keep an open mind, not to judge someone's culture by my own, but to be part of this ceremony... I understand from Dr Crusher that Worf will never regain the use of his legs. That doesn't mean his life is over. That's a very human perspective. For a Klingon in Worf's position, his life is over. I can't accept that. If you were dying, terminally ill with an incurable disease, and facing the remaining few days of your life in pain, wouldn't you look on death as a release? Worf isn't dying and he is not in pain. He could lead a long life... You and I could learn to live with that disability, but not Worf. His life ended when those containers fell on him. We don't have to agree with it or understand it,... ..but we do have to respect his beliefs. I can respect his beliefs, but he is asking me to take an active part in his committing suicide! He's asking for your help because you're his friend. You'll have to make your decision based on that friendship. Which leaves me back where I started. Will. Look, I'm sorry, I cannot help you make this decision, but I can tell you this. Klingons choose their friends with great care. If he didn't know he could count on you, he would never have asked. Why won't you let me see him? Alexander, I told you, it's not my decision. Your father doesn't... My father wants to see me. You're the one keeping me away from him. I think you know that's not true. Then, why can't I see him? Come here. He's been injured and he's embarrassed. And to have anyone see him now would make him feel worse. Even if it were you. This is part of that Klingon stuff, isn't it? My mother always said Klingons had a lot of dumb ideas about honour. That Klingon stuff is very important to your father. It isn't very important to me. I don't care about being Klingon, I just want to see my father. It's been a long day. Get ready for bed and we'll talk about this again in the morning. Alexander is scared, confused, hurt,... all because his father is refusing to see him. You know why I left those instructions. Yes, it's not the Klingon way, right? It is a question of honour, and I would ask that you respect my wishes in this matter. All I care about, at this moment, is a little boy who's terrified he's going to lose his father. Maybe it's time you stopped lying here worrying about your honour, and started thinking about someone else, like your son. Would you like us to come back? No, please, come in, Doctor. This is Dr Toby Russell from the Adelman Neurological Institute. She specializes in spinal injuries. We've discussed a variety of surgical procedures. None of them will repair the spinal cord, but we have found a way for you to regain much of your mobility. We can implant neural transducers into your lower torso and legs. They pick up electrical impulses from your brain and stimulate the corresponding muscles. With a little work, you could regain 60 to 70 percent of your motor control. The first step is to fit your legs with motor-assist units like this. They're a training device. Once you've mastered using them, you can move on to the implants. Now try to move your leg. No, that's good for a first try. It will take some time to get used to... No! I will not live like that. These are very sophisticated devices. With enough time, they'll give you... 60 percent of my mobility? No. I will not be seen lurching like some half-Klingon machine. The object of ridicule and disgust. Perhaps all this seems a bit frightening to you now. I want you to take time before making a decision. Think about it. There is one other option I'd like you to consider. It's called genetronic replication. It's still experimental, but if it works, it will restore virtually all your mobility, and without the need for artificial implants. I thought we'd discussed genetronics? We did. We decided against recommending it. You heard him, he'd rather die than live with the implants. I gave him a better option than suicide. He's grasping for straws and you're giving him one. Now he's going to be thinking about this miracle cure of yours. There's a real chance this could work. If it does, it'll be a major breakthrough in neurogenetics that will change a lot of lives. You're using the desperation of an injured man as an excuse to try a procedure that you couldn't normally do. Starfleet Medical have turned down your request to test genetronics on humanoids three times already. Are you really going to hide behind the rules of some bureaucracy? Beverly, your patient's life is at stake here. Before you do any of this... Picard to Dr Crusher. Go ahead. We've located the Denver survivors. We're ready here. Triage teams standing by. Very well. We'll transport survivors immediately. Bridge out. Beverly. Could you use a pair of hands? Absolutely. Father? Come in, Alexander. Deanna said you hurt your back, that you couldn't walk. I am still struggling with my injury. I was worried about you. There is much to discuss. There will be difficult times ahead. You must be strong. I understand. Good. As Klingons, we all must be prepared for... Father! Take him away. Let me help you. Leave! Alexander, go on. It'll be alright, I'll take care of him. Use this to cauterize the tissue. Yes, Doctor. What happened here? Neural metaphasic shock. From leporazine? That's unusual. He couldn't take it. His blood pressure was too low. I tried something else. A morathial series? No, a new rival therapy I've been working with. It's called borathium. I've had some very good results. You used this man to test a theory? Borathium is decades ahead of leporazine and morathial. Morathial would have saved his life. His injuries were so severe no conventional treatment would have saved him. You didn't even try standard treatment. I made the choice I thought gave him the best chance of surviving. Isn't that what you would do? You used this to test one of your theories, like you're doing with Worf. That's what this is really about, isn't it? Lt Worf. I'm offering him a chance to recover fully. A chance you can't give him. This is about the kind of medicine you practise. I make no excuses for my approach. I don't like losing a patient any more than you do. But I'm looking down a long road. This man didn't die for nothing. The data that I gathered is invaluable. It will help save thousands of lives. That won't be any comfort to his family. Let me ask you this. If some years from now, borathium therapy saved the life of someone you loved, would you still condemn me? I will not be drawn into a hypothetical argument. Your research here is over. You are relieved of medical duties. Is that clear? Perfectly. Doctor? I'm on my way to see your patient. Be my guest. Don't expect much conversation, he's in full Klingon mode, honourable, strong and closed-minded. I understand that you have relieved Dr Russell of duty. That's right. She's irresponsible. I won't have her practising here. Beverly,... ..maybe you should let her go ahead with this genetronic procedure. How can you say that? She has a theory based on a little empirical knowledge and a lot of supposition. If he can't make a full recovery, Worf will kill himself. Not in my sickbay he won't. I'll put him in a restraining field and post security around his door. How long will you keep him there? A week? A month? A year? If I have to. Suicide is not an option. Putting aside the fact that a paraplegic can live a full life, conventional therapy could restore much of his mobility. But not all of it. No, not all of it! There are some things I can't fix. Klingon or no, he'll have to accept his condition. He can't make the journey you're asking of him. You want him to go from contemplating suicide to living with a disability, but it's too far. And the road between covers a lifetime of values, beliefs. He can't do it, Beverly. But perhaps he can come part of the way. Maybe he can be persuaded to forego the ritual in order to take the chance of regaining the kind of life he needs. A Klingon may not be good at accepting defeat, but he knows all about taking risks. The first tenet of good medicine is never make the patient any worse. Right now, Worf is alive and functioning. If he goes into that operation, he could come out a corpse. This may not be good medicine, but for Worf, it may be his only choice. I am ready, Commander. I've been studying this ritual of yours. Do you know what I've decided? I think it's despicable. I hate everything about it. Casual disregard for life, the way it tries to cloak suicide in some glorious notion of honour. I may have to respect your beliefs, but I don't have to like them. It is not something I expect you to understand. No. All you really expect me to do is bring you the knife and then walk away so you can kill yourself in peace. Well, I'm not gonna make it that easy for you. It is not easy for me. But each of us must die in our own time. And my time... Remember Sandoval? Hit with a disruptor blast two years ago. She lived for about a week. Fang-lee? Marla Aster? Tasha Yar? How many friends have we watched die? I've lost count. Every single one of them fought for life until the very end. I do not welcome death, Commander. Are you sure? I think you feel noble about this. ""Look at me. Aren't I courageous? An honourable Klingon?"" Let me remind you, a Klingon does not put his desires above those of his family or his friends. How many people on this ship consider you a friend? How many owe you their lives? Have you ever thought about how you've affected us? How we might feel about your dying? Will you or will you not help me with the Hegh'bat? You are my friend. And in spite of everything I've said, if it were my place, I would probably help you. But I've been studying Klingon ritual and law, and I've discovered that it's not my place to fill that role. According to tradition, that honour falls to a family member, preferably the oldest son. That is impossible. He is a child. The son of a Klingon is a man the day he can first hold a blade. True? Alexander is not fully Klingon. He is part human. That's an excuse. What you really mean is it would be too hard to look at your son and tell him to bring you the knife. Watch you stab it into your heart, then pull the knife out of your chest and wipe your blood on his sleeve. That's the rite of death, isn't it? Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Worf. I can't help you. There's only one person on this ship who can. You said you wanted to see me. I need you to help me. Anything, Father. I have taught you about Klingon customs,... ..the beliefs which we value. According to tradition, I must take my life after suffering this kind of injury. But I have decided to break with tradition. I have decided to live. I'm glad, Father. I must still undergo a dangerous operation. I may still die, but it will not be by my own hand. Return this to our quarters. Yes, sir. Chief Medical Officer's log, supplemental. After consultation with Starfleet Medical and much soul-searching, I have granted Worf's request to undergo the genetronic procedure. We started multiplication today. Teacher said I'm faster than anybody in my class. We will speak again soon. Yes, Father. If I die,... ..he must be cared for. I'll make sure he reaches your parents safely. No. They are elderly. They cannot care for Alexander. Counsellor, I have a serious request to make of you. Would you consider...? You want me to raise Alexander? I have come to have a great respect for you, Deanna. You have been most helpful in guiding me since Alexander's arrival. I can't imagine anyone who would be a better parent to my son. If it is too much to ask... I'd be honoured. I am ready. Focus the drechtal beams on the anterior and posterior spinal roots. Focused. Initiate. All neural connections below the first vertebrae have been separated. Microtome. I'm severing the brain stem now. Cerebral cortex placed on life support at 0831 hours. Three hours 26 minutes until primary brain dysfunction. OK, let's remove the support frame. Exoscalpel. I've notified Starfleet that our survey of Sector 37628 will be delayed by a week while we drop off the survivors. Good. I understand from Mr. La Forge that there's a minor fluctuation in the starboard warp coil. I've scheduled a stress-simulation routine to check it out. Has there been any word? No. Preliminary genetronic scans are complete. Initiating DNA sequencer. Reading at ten to the ninth base pairs per second. Once we're past the first two levels, we'll begin the encoding sequence. Increase TCH levels to... What's happened? The scanner can't read the Klingon dorsal-root ganglia. This showed up in your simulations? Yes. I thought I made adjustments. Bring me the detronal scanner. I can scan the ganglia manually. It'll just take a little longer. One hour 43 minutes until primary brain dysfunction. Retract the paraspinal muscle. Got it. Watch the proximal nerve endings. I see them. Make sure the cranial segment is 15 centimeters from the brain stem. Fluctuation in the isocortex. 20cc inaprovaline. OK. Release retractors on the paraspinal. How much time left on life support? 27 minutes. Cover. Close, please. Ready. Tissue growth proceeding at anticipated rates. No initial signs of rejection. OK, ready. Terminate life support. Life support disengaged. Neural connections appear stable. Looking good so far. Fluctuations in the isocortex. 40cc inaprovaline. Synaptic response falling. BP dropping. Now 60 over 40. VeK'tal response falling rapidly. Increase oxygen to 95 percent. Beginning direct synaptic stimulation. Respirations shallow and rapid. No response in the isocortex. 75cc inaprovaline. Heart rate is erratic. Going into cardiac arrest. Alright. Let's go to chloromydride. 15cc. We're losing him. No BP. No pulse. Brain activity? No higher brain functions. OK, 25cc cordrazine. That'll kill him. We've done a good job of that already. No BP, no pulse. No activity in the isocortex. Cortical stimulator. Now. Again. Doctor. Alright, make a note in the log. Death occurred at 1240 hours. It was all going so well. No anomalies during replication. No initial rejection. No. Alexander, I am so sorry. I want to see him. Alex... No! I want to see him. Activate biomonitors. 25cc polyadrenaline. What's going on? Not sure, but if I'm right, one of the unnecessary redundancies... Doctor. I don't believe it. Begin cardio-aid and ventilation. That's amazing. There must be a back-up for his synaptic functions. Vital signs are stabilizing. Begin rybo-synetic therapy. Increase oxygen to 90 percent. Prepare a thalamic-booster series. Well, I'd say your patient's recovery is going well. You won't acknowledge what I did for him. You just can't admit that it was my research that made this possible. I am delighted that Worf is going to recover. You gambled, he won. Not all of your patients are so lucky. You scare me, Doctor. You risk your patients' lives and justify it in the name of research. Genuine research takes time. Sometimes a lifetime of painstaking, detailed work in order to get any results. Not for you. You take short cuts. Right through living tissue. You put your research ahead of your patients' lives. And, as far as I'm concerned, that's a violation of our most sacred trust. I'm sure your work will be hailed as a stunning breakthrough. Enjoy your laurels, Doctor. I'm not sure I could. This is gonna take time, Worf. Your muscles are still sorting out their new signals. Don't rush it. Alexander. Remember what we talked about? Your father wants to do this by himself. It's alright, Counsellor. I would appreciate some help from my son. We will work together. Yes, sir. "
S5E17,"Captain's log, star date 45614.6. We have been contacted by an androgynous race, the J'naii, to investigate the mysterious disappearance of one of their shuttlecraft. Captain, we are approaching the designated coordinates. On screen. Long-range scan, Mr. Data. The sensors find no evidence of the shuttle in the system. It couldn't have travelled outside the system. Reconfigure high-resolution sweep. Check for any debris. Scans find no debris in that radius. I don't understand. A shuttle doesn't simply vanish. There has to be an explanation. Captain, I'm detecting an unusual reading, a neutrino emission with no visible source. Explanation? I have none, sir. I recommend we launch a probe. Make it so. Probe is launched. Sensors show no evidence of any unusual phenomenon. Probe is no longer transmitting. What happened? Where did it go? Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, supplemental. The disappearance of our probe suggests that we may have found the first instance of null space. an anomaly which until now had been theoretical. Cmdr Riker has been working with J'naii specialists, to formalize this hypothesis. During the creation of a star system, when clouds of interstellar dust and gas coalesce, turbulent magnetic and gravitational fields may develop. In certain conditions, these condense into abnormal pockets of space. We think your system contains one of these pockets. The pocket absorbs electromagnetic energy from anything entering it. Like a shuttle. Or probe. Making them powerless. But outside the pocket, the energy is bent around it, making it naturally cloaked. That's why we cannot see it, and our sensors cannot read it. Is the shuttle still there? We think so. It couldn't sustain its energy, but it wouldn't be damaged. Since our shuttles carry plestorene backup systems, we think life support would sustain for as long as ten days. Perhaps our crew survived? We can send in one of our shuttles, but its energy would be absorbed. We're working on maintaining reserves long enough to rescue your crew. Commander, we're grateful for your help. Whatever resources we can provide are yours. I've been thinking. When the time comes, I want to pilot the shuttle. It's a Starfleet craft. I cannot ask you to put yourself in danger for our crew. You can't pilot a shuttle you don't know. I happen to be a good pilot. I happen to be a good pilot, too. And I know my way around the shuttle. What if we team up? When can we go over the flight operations? Right now. Is this the one? This is it. Short-range craft, two 1250-millicochrane warp engines. Microfusion thrusters? Right. Armament? None usually. But this has two type-four phaser emitters, to chart the null space. Chart it? Mr. La Forge thinks the energy absorption is linked to its size. I'm not sure how we'd map something we can't see. With the emitters. Shoot photon pulses into the pocket and chart where they disappear. That should give us an outline. Let's look at the controls. Later we'll do a flight simulation. Let's do a systems review. I'll talk you through it. Propulsion, transfer conduits. Where's the schematic reactor-assembly? There it is. Engine nacelles. There's nothing here that's unfamiliar. Navigational deflector, polarity-source generators. It's like you grew up in a shuttle. I did. My parents were pilots. I was flying with them before I could walk. Then I entered flight school. Krite was my instructor. He had a good student. ""He""? There are no ""hes"" or ""shes"" in a species without gender. OK, for two days I've tried to form sentences without personal pronouns. Now I give up. What should I use? ""It""? To us, that's rude. We use a pronoun that is neutral. I do not think there is a translation. I'll muddle through. Forgive me if a ""he"" or ""she"" slips by, OK? Well, if that's the systems review, I don't see any problem. What's next? Lunch. Thank you. What is it? Split-pea soup. It's my father's recipe. I had it programmed into the replicators. Well? Unusual. But I think I like it. It's very healthy. Helps to keep you warm on cold Alaskan nights. We prefer to stay warm by sleeping with a friend. I see. Not to mate. Just to sleep together for warmth. Still sounds better than pea soup. We are puzzling to you, aren't we? A little. It's hard to grasp the idea of no gender. It is just as hard for us to understand the strange division in your species,... ..males and females. You are male. Tell me about males. What is it makes you different from females? Snips and snails and puppy dog tails? You have a dog's tail? It's an old nursery rhyme. Girls are made from sugar and spice, boys are made from snips and snails. It sounds better to be female. It's an old-fashioned way of looking at the sexes. Not to say there's no real difference between them. Physically men are bigger, stronger. We have different sexual organs. Men can't bear young. What about feelings or emotional attitudes? Are they different? Most people think so. But that kind of question would take a lifetime to answer. Let me ask you, what's it like on a planet where people have no gender? I'm afraid I don't understand. Well... Who leads when you dance? lf you dance. We do. And whoever's taller leads. Without the battle of the sexes, you probably don't argue as much. Because we don't have gender doesn't mean we don't have conflicts. We're strong-minded, we love a good fight. There's not much difference between our species. Maybe not. What kind of woman do you find attractive? I like one who's intelligent and sure of herself, who I can talk with and get something back. But the most important thing of all? She has to laugh at my jokes. Tell me, is that the kind of woman that all human males prefer? Not at all. Some like quiet, demure women. Others prefer a lot of energy. Some only respond to physical attractiveness. Others couldn't care less. There are no rules. You make it sound very complex. Believe me, it is. Well, perhaps it is that complexity... ..which makes the differences in the sexes so interesting. Good evening, Commander. Good evening. Please take my place, Krite. I have to be going. Thank you for going over the flight protocols. It was very helpful. Captain's log, supplemental. Riker and the J'naii pilot will chart the null-space pocket. If they are successful, we can proceed with the rescue attempt. I've illuminated Delta four grid map. We'll start there and expand. Stand by. Forward phaser array. Pulse vanished at Delta 4.2 by .3. Firing second burst. Delta 4.4 by .5. This is working. Initiating computer task hand-off. Commander, tell me about your sexual organs. Is that an uncomfortable subject? No, but it doesn't tend to be a topic of casual conversation. I'm interested in your mating practices. What is involved with two sexes? Correcting course. 021, mark zero. Mating? Right. It's pretty simple. Men inseminate the women. The women carry the baby. Our foetuses are incubated in fibrous husks, which the parents inseminate. From what we know of other species, our method is less risky and less painful. And less enjoyable. Less enjoyable? For humans, the sexual act brings a closeness and intimacy. It can be a very pleasurable experience. Inseminating a husk... That's just the last step. Mating is a long ritual for us, full of variety and adventure, and I assure you, it is extremely pleasurable. I'm picking up a neutrino emission from within the null space. That may be from our shuttle. I'll note these coordinates. I wonder... What? If a human and a J'naii would be sexually compatible. I don't know. But it would never be permitted. Why not? The idea of gender, it is offensive to my people. You see, long ago, we had two sexes, as you do. But we evolved into a higher form. I don't mean to sound insulting, but on my planet we have been taught that gender is primitive. Primitive? Less evolved. Maybe so. But sometimes, there's a lot to be said for an experience that's primitive. Delta five grid map is fully plotted. Adjusting course. 029, mark zero. The port engine's down! Reducing power. Not enough. Activate manoeuvring thrusters. Thrusters aren't responding. I'll reroute the firing sequence. Inertial dampeners failing! Hang on! Shuttle, do you read me? Affirmative. We've lost an engine. We'll try a tractor beam. The sooner the better. We have an injury. Transport Soren to sickbay! Right away. It's just a minor concussion. You're going to be fine. This will reduce the inflammation. Doctor, you are female. Yes. Forgive me, I do not mean to be rude, but I'm curious. What is it like? Well, it's... It's just the way I am. I've never thought about what it's like. I notice you tend to have longer hair, and you arrange it more elaborately. You apply colour to your bodies. Colour? You put colour on your mouths. And your eyes, your cheeks, your fingernails. The men don't. That's true. Then, it is up to women to attract the men. No. Men want to be attractive, too, believe me. They just go about it differently. No colour. No colour. They pretend they're not doing anything to attract a woman, even when it's the most important thing on their minds. This is very confusing. Then, are women considered more superior or the men? Neither. In the past, women were often considered weak and inferior. But that hasn't been true for a long time. Will, your co-pilot is gonna be fine. The injury was minor. Glad to hear it. You're not rid of me yet, Commander. I can complete the mission. Glad you feel better. Why did the shuttle go into a spin? The port nacelle must have nipped the null pocket and shut down. Are we still on schedule, then? That depends on how you're doing. I'm fine. We should check the port engine. Whoa! Maybe we should get the Doctor's opinion first. Doctor? I don't see any problem. But if you have headache or dizziness, come back. You have my word. Alright. This hand, the game is Federation Day. What is that? The Federation was founded in 2161, so, twos, sixes and aces are wild. That is a woman's game. Why is that? All those wild cards, they support a weak hand. A man's game has no wild cards. So, it's a woman's game because women are weak and need more help? Yes. And only today, I told a J'naii those attitudes were but a distant memory. The J'naii. They bother me. Why, Worf? They just do. They're all alike. No males, no females. I'm sure we're just as strange to them. One of them is overcoming the differences, at least in regards to one of us. What are you saying, Doctor? I could be wrong. But I get the impression that Soren is attracted to Cmdr Riker. A human and a J'naii? Impossible! Why? Good question. Worf? All these wild cards. It's difficult to know what is exactly in my hand. However, I will open with 50. The transporter array is in. In null space, we'll need to initialize it before we beam the J'naii crew onto this shuttle. But there should be power left to beam us to the Enterprise. Is the buffer-field generator in? Geordi thinks it'll be ready by 0800 tomorrow. But before that, we should see if we can balance this engine. Can you access the starboard manifold thrust? There. Set the arc at 6.3. I'll optimize the plasma flow. Commander, I'd like to tell you something. Something that's not easy to say. What's that? I find you attractive. I'm taking a terrible risk telling you that. It means revealing something to you, something that, if it were known on my planet, would be dangerous for me. Occasionally, among my people,... ..there are a few who are born different,... ..who are throwbacks from the era when we all had gender. Some have strong inclinations to maleness, and some have urges to be female. I am one of the latter. I have to admit I had a feeling you were different. I was hoping you would. But in front of the others, I must be careful not to reveal myself. Why? On our world, these feelings are forbidden. Those who are discovered are shamed and ridiculed, and only by undergoing psychotectic therapy and... ..having all elements of gender eliminated, can they be accepted into society again. Those of us who have these urges live secret and guarded lives. We seek each other out,... ..always hiding, always terrified of being discovered. How long have you known that you were like this? I've known I was different all my life. But I did not know how or why until I was older. And when you realized, what then? I remember when I was very young, before I knew what I was, there was a rumour at my school... ..that one of the students preferred a gender, in that case, male. The children started making fun of him. And every day they were more cruel. They could tell he was afraid, and... ..somehow that seemed to encourage them. One morning in class, he appeared, bleeding and in ripped clothes. He said he had fallen down. Of course, the school authorities found out and took him away, and gave him psychotectic treatments. When he came back,... ..he stood in front of the whole school... ..and told us how happy he was now that he had been cured. After that, I realized how dangerous it was to be different. And once I got older, and knew what I was, I was terrified. I have had to live with that fear ever since. Do you have relationships with others? Yes. With those who have discovered they are male. I have had to live a life of pretence and lies. But with you, I can be honest. Please, don't say anything. Just think about it. That's it, everything checks out. The energy buffer is functioning. It should reduce the power drain by 40 percent. How long will we have? Let's just say, don't waste any time in there. He'll need continuous readouts on consumption. The rate may not be constant. I understand. Then that's it. I'll monitor what I can, but inside the pocket you're on your own. The crew's condition is unknown, so we'll all beam to sickbay. I'll tell Dr Crusher to be standing by. La Forge to bridge. Picard here. Ready to initiate pre-launch sequence. Proceed, Mr. Data. Initiating pre-launch sequence. Request flight clearance. Clearance is granted. The shuttle is under way, sir. Good hunting, Commander. Thank you, sir. See you for dinner. Heading confirmed. Energy readings normal. Power reserves stabilized at 100 percent. Acknowledged. It's dead ahead, approximately 50 kilometres. Riker to Enterprise, we're taking her in. Riker to Enterprise? Riker to Enterprise. Power reserves down to 84 percent. Look! Try hailing them. Calling the Taris Murn, do you read me? They're unconscious but alive. Stand by. I'm gonna transport them over. Power reserves at 68 percent and dropping. The null space is affecting the annular-confinement beam. We used ten megajoules. We're down to 34 percent of reserves. We can give it one more try. Any more, we won't have enough power to get out. They need attention quickly. OK. Stand by to transport to the Enterprise. Here we go. Energy consumption? We're down to nine percent. Not enough to get back. Sitting here, we'll lose all systems in an hour, including life support. I'll reroute the propulsion system to the transporter. Rechannel navigation systems. Transfer all the energy we've got. Sensors, life support. This might give us one last shot. An energy shift that size will cause an overload. The shuttle... Will explode! But if we stay, we're dead anyway. Maximum energy levels, five seconds. See you in a minute. They've been oxygen-deprived. There isn't any significant damage. Prepare some dexalin. Commander, thank you. Soren was very helpful. Would you all join us this evening? We want to express our gratitude. We'd be happy to. Noor will be eager for a report. We should return to the surface. I will see you later, Commander. There you are. I wondered what had happened to our guest of honour. I needed some air. After a while at social functions, I need to breathe a little. I would think you had attended so many affairs, that it had become second nature to you. I was raised outdoors. I've never been comfortable in crowded rooms. What do you think of our planet? Isn't it beautiful? Yes, it is. It's beautiful. We have many varieties of plant life. Perhaps you would like to inspect some of them? Yes, I would. I've always been interested in exobotany. Please, let me take you on a tour. Thank you. It's kind of you. One of my favourites is this menellen tree. The leaves first turn pure white and then blue, when the weather gets cold. This is called a falla bush. It produces a fragrant flower on only one day of the year. Captain's log, star date 45620.4. In the hope that a map of null space will prevent losing other ships, we remain in orbit of J'naii, charting the anomaly. Come in. Hello, Will. What's all this? Wonderful things! My mother sent a box that belonged to one of my father's ancestors. It was stored on Earth and just recently turned up. You know who any of these people are? No. Some of the pictures have names on, but most don't. I look at them and wonder who they are and if they are related to me. This one looks like you. Deanna, I have something on my mind. I had to see you. Has something happened? I've met someone. Someone who's becoming important to me. Soren. Yes. You're my friend, and I thought... I don't know. I thought I should tell you. I'm glad you did. Nothing will change between us, will it? Of course it will. Relationships constantly change. But we'll still be friends, maybe better friends. You're a part of my life and I'm a part of yours. That much will always be true. Hello, I'm here to see Soren. I know. We had an appointment to discuss... I don't think so. Excuse me? We know what you two are doing. Where is Soren? It won't happen again. Where is Soren? In custody, and there's nothing you can do. The hell there isn't. You are aware of the charges against you? Yes. Do you intend to dispute them? Well, what is your response? These proceedings are closed to... I just opened them. This is a private matter. We are grateful for your help, but that gives you no right to interfere. I just want you to know what happened. It was all my fault. I was attracted to Soren. I pursued. I insisted. I didn't understand your ways until she explained and rejected me. Nothing happened between us. I ask forgiveness. I behaved inappropriately. Is this true? No. Soren. I am tired of lies. I am female. I was born that way. I have had those feelings, those longings, all of my life. It is not unnatural. I am not sick because I feel this way. I do not need to be helped. I do not need to be cured. What I need... ..and what all of those who are like me need... ..is your understanding,... ..and your compassion. We have not injured you in any way. And yet, we are scorned and attacked. And all because we are different. What we do... ..is no different from what you do. We talk, and laugh. We complain about work,... ..and we wonder about growing old. We talk about our families, and we worry about the future. And we cry with each other when things seem hopeless. All of the loving things that you do with each other, that is what we do. And for that we are called misfits, and deviants and criminals! What right do you have to punish us? What right do you have to change us? What makes you think you can dictate how people love each other? I congratulate you, Soren. Admitting your perversion makes it much more likely we can help you. Wait. You don't have to do this. Let her go with me to the Enterprise. We would give her asylum. You'd never see her again. That would solve it. You'd be rid of her. She would never influence anyone again. After Soren's diatribe, you must think us a cruel, repressive people. Nothing could be more untrue. I'm looking for a solution for everyone. We take our obligations to our citizens seriously. Soren is sick, and sick people want to get well. What if she wants to stay the way she is? You don't understand. We have a very high success rate in treating deviants. And without exception, they become happier people after treatment, and grateful that we care enough to cure them. You see, Commander, on this world, everyone wants to be normal. She is! Take her away. Treatment will begin tomorrow. Don't do this! Soren! No more, Commander! Riker to Enterprise. One to transport. I just can't leave her to be given psychotectic treatments. I don't know what to do! Well, I could talk to Noor. Perhaps there's a way to work something out. Their minds are set. They don't want to hear an alternative. Then, I'm not sure there's much we can do. There has to be. My relationship with Soren is not trivial. She's very important to me. It's my fault. I have to help her. If you're here for sanction, I can't give it to you. I know. But I have to do something. Interfering with J'naii affairs is against the Prime Directive. I'm aware of that. If you violate it, you may jeopardize your career. Starfleet takes this seriously. I can't defend you if you go too far. You understand? You've made yourself clear, sir. Don't put at risk everything you've worked for. Thank you. May I be excused now? Who is it? Lt Worf. Come in. I have the plan for deploying warning buoys around the null space. Fine. I'll take a look at it later. Yes, sir. Thank you. You're dismissed. Commander, I know what transpired on the planet's surface. Are you, by any chance, considering an unannounced visit? I will go with you. Lieutenant... Sir, you are my commanding officer. If you order me to stay, I will obey, but I ask you not to give that order. A warrior does not let a friend face danger alone. Something's happening. They're leaving. OK. Excuse me. I need to speak to her alone for a moment. Wait. Don't worry, we'll be out of here in a minute. Please, don't! Alright, we're almost there. You cannot do this. I won't let them hurt you. You'll be safe on the ship. I am so sorry. It was my fault that you got involved in all this. Everything's going to be alright. No, it is not. What are you talking about? It was all a mistake. And I should have realized it from the beginning. What? That I was sick. I had these terrible urges. That is why I reached out to you. But it was wrong. And I see that now. I do not understand how I could have done what I did. Maybe Dr Crusher can treat you and bring you back to the way you were. Why would I want that? Soren. I love you. I'm sorry. How long to the Phelan system, Mr. Data? At warp six, 53 hours, sir. Commander. Captain. Starfleet is asking us to proceed to the Phelan system to negotiate a trade agreement. Yes, sir. I didn't know when to tell them we will be there. Is our business with the J'naii finished? Finished, sir. Very well. Take us out of orbit. Set a course for the Phelan system, warp six. Aye, sir. Engage. "

Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, star date 45652. 1. The Enterprise has entered an area known as the Typhon Expanse. We're the first Starfleet vessel to chart this region. I wonder if he's stacking the deck. I assure you, the cards are sufficiently randomized. I hope so. Eight. Ace. Queen. The dealer receives a four. No bet. Ten. Seven. No help there. Pair of ladies for the Doctor. Dealer receives a nine. Doctor? You show the highest hand. You control the next bet. Thank you, Data. I bet ten. Worf? Jack. Four. Deuce. Six. 20. Your 20, and 50 more. 50? I'm in. I will also see the bet. Seven. A possible straight for Cmdr Riker. Jack. Still no help for the Klingon. Eight. Nine for the dealer. 20. Too rich for my blood. Your 200, 100 more. Fold. 200. Your two, and 300 more. He does not have a straight. Well, we'll soon find out, won't we? Let's see your cards. Take it. How did you know I was bluffing? I just had a feeling. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. It's the way your left eyebrow raises when you're bluffing. Just kidding, Commander. Ogawa to Dr Crusher. Go ahead. Cmdr La Forge needs you in sickbay. On my way. At first I thought the catwalk was spinning. It turns out it was me. Luckily, Fletcher grabbed me. It's a long way down to the bottom of the warp core. You have the symptoms of an inner-ear infection. That would explain the dizziness and headaches. But there's no physical evidence. My guess is you've been working too hard. I have been putting in extra hours on this Typhon Expanse project. 20cc of vertazine should clear up the dizziness. But finding time to relax is up to you. What? What is it? Have you had these symptoms before? No. You're sure? I'm positive. Why? It's funny. I feel like we've discussed this before. I remember giving you a hypospray for dizziness. I've never had these symptoms. You're thinking of another patient. No, I'm sure it was you. Well, try to get some rest. Stay away from high places for a few days. Thanks, Doc. Goodnight. Goodnight. As you can see, the Typhon Expanse is huge. If we want to chart it, we'll have to launch a probe soon. What about the luminosity studies? That may pose a problem. How so? The spectrometers are still down. They were supposed to be on line. They were until Stellar Dynamics decided to install new modules. I recommend a graviton polarimeter. It performs a similar function. Make it so, Mr. Data. Captain, I have something I'd like to report. Yes, Doctor? I heard voices in my room last night. I was alone, so I thought I was imagining things. But ten other people reported hearing voices at the same time. What were they saying? I couldn't make them out. Data, did the sensors pick up anything unusual? No anomalous readings were reported. When we're through, recheck the sensor logs. Aye, sir. Counsellor? I sensed nothing unusual last night. Maybe it's the comm system. Bridge to Capt Picard. Go ahead. We have unusual readings, 20,000 kilometres off the starboard bow. On our way. Report. Sensors didn't detect the phenomenon until now, sir. It is a localized distortion of the space-time continuum. On screen. Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow. Aye, sir. Manoeuvring thrusters are not responding. Distortion field is fluctuating. All main systems down. Power levels dropping rapidly. Red alert. There is an energy build-up. We have to get out of here. Captain, something is emerging. Shields up. Evasive manoeuvres. Shields inoperative. The helm's not responding. The vessel is on a collision course. Impact in 36 seconds. Hail them. No response. Suggestions? Decompress main shuttle bay to kick us out of the way. I suggest we use the tractor beam to alter their trajectory. Mr. Worf, make it so. Engaging tractor beam. Damage report.

How did you know I'd call your bluff? I just had a feeling. Me, too. Ogawa to Dr Crusher. Go ahead. Cmdr La Forge needs you in sickbay. On my way. At first I thought the catwalk was spinning. Turns out it was me. Luckily, Fletcher grabbed me. It's a long way down to the bottom of the warp core. You have the symptoms of an inner-ear infection. That would explain the headaches and dizziness. But there's no physical... What? What is it? Have you had these symptoms before? Come to think of it, yes. Do you recall when? No, I don't... We've had this discussion before. I've given you this examination. Let's check the medical logs. You've been treated for headaches from your visor but I read no mention of dizziness. Must be déjá vu. Both of us? About the same thing? Crusher to Picard. Yes, Doctor? Do you have a minute? My Aunt Adele cured a lot of sleepless nights with steamed milk. Thank you. Nutmeg. Whenever I get insomnia, I try to perfect the recipe. It was the eeriest feeling. When the glass broke, it triggered the sensation even more that I'd done it all before. You know, earlier, I was reading this book... ..and I had the distinct feeling that I'd read certain paragraphs before. But I assumed that I'd read the book years ago and I'd forgotten. I've had this feeling for hours. And then the voices... Well, it could be nothing more than the result of a sleepless night. But let's be sure. Have Data and Geordi run a diagnostic on the time and place you heard the voices. We'll discuss the results tomorrow at 0700 hours. Thank you. For everything. No, thank Aunt Adele. The internal scans were negative. There was no evidence of auditory anomalies. As far as the sensors are concerned, nothing unusual happened. Ten other people reported hearing voices at the same time I did. Bridge to Capt Picard. Go ahead. We have unusual readings, 20,000 kilometres off the starboard bow. On our way. Report.

We are the first Starfleet vessel to chart this region. I wonder if he's stacking the deck. I assure you, the cards are sufficiently randomized. I hope... so. Something wrong, Mr. Worf? I am experiencing nlb'poH, the feeling I have done this before. Last Tuesday. That's not what I mean. I've been having the same feeling. Keep dealing, Data. Eight. Ace. A queen. You're going to give me a queen. You're going to get a four. Deal, Data. But no one has bet. Forget the bet. Just deal. Ten. Seven. Queen. Nine. Jack. Four. Deuce. Six. This is highly improbable. How did we know? Wait. Crusher to sickbay. Sickbay here. Is Cmdr La Forge there? No, Doctor, he's not. Wait a minute. He just came in. You wanted to see me, Doctor? Yes. Captain, have you been getting the feeling that you've experienced things before? A sense of repetition? Yes, recently. While I was reading. Why do you ask? There have been similar incidents all over the ship. Feelings of déjá vu. I had a premonition Geordi would come into sickbay. Seconds later he did. With the symptoms of an ear infection. I was going to run tests but I had a feeling they'd be negative. So I ran an optical diagnostic which traced the problem to Geordi's visor. His dizziness is caused by a phase shift in his visual receptors, making him see images that aren't there. They're like blurry after-images. I ran a scan to see if I could detect what he saw. I picked up distortions in the surrounding dekyon field. Somehow his visor translates them into visual impulses. Could be a malfunction in the warp-field generator. Run a localized subspace scan for anything else. Keep me advised. Crusher to Cmdr La Forge. La Forge here. Geordi, I just heard what sounded like voices in my room. But no one else is here. Sensors picked up something strange. We're checking it out. I'm on my way. Looks like you managed to record 6.2 seconds' worth. Let's see if we can filter the signal. Then I wasn't hearing things? The sound appears real. However, it does not correspond to any ship's system, nor to any voice communication at that time. Then where did it come from? You heard it at the same time our scan picked up a dekyon-field distortion. The two may be related. Let's have another listen. Computer, perform a narrow-bandwidth analysis. Eliminate non-vocal waveform components. Can we isolate the voices? Find out what they're saying? Computer, continuous playback. There are approximately 1,000 voices overlapping. The voices are those of the Enterprise crew. Our voices. I'm sorry to call you so early but we couldn't wait till 0700 hours. We think we have an explanation for the occurrences. Commander. This is gonna sound pretty wild. Somehow we seem to have entered a temporal-causality loop. We think we're stuck in a fragment in time. We've been repeating that fragment over and over. Is this causing our déjá vu? Yes, but it's more. In déjá vu, you think you're repeating events. We actually are. Our theory is this. Every time the loop begins again, everything resets itself and starts all over. We don't remember anything so each time, we think it's the first. You mean we could have had this conversation a dozen times? A dozen, a hundred. It's impossible to tell. We could have been here for hours, days, maybe years. If what we're saying is true, those voices I heard might be echoes from previous loops. It's the same with my visor. After-images in time. If you're right, how did it happen? How did we get there? I have a hypothesis that may explain that. I have analyzed the recording. Most is quite ordinary. 150 discussions about ship operations, 252 conversations of a personal nature, five couples in romantic encounters... Your point, Mr. Data? There is evidence of a disaster aboard the Enterprise, severe enough that the Captain ordered all hands to abandon ship. I have isolated three segments of this recording that are crucial. A localized distortion of the space-time continuum. Collision course. Impact in 36 seconds. All hands, abandon ship! Repeat. All hands, abandon... Worf refers to a distortion. If this were temporal and we were close enough, it's possible an explosion ruptured the space-time continuum. We collided, exploded, then got caught in this repeating loop. If you're right, we could escape by avoiding collision. That's our guess. Perhaps we should reverse course. For all we know, reversing course may lead us into the crash. No. We can't start second-guessing ourselves. Stay on course until we have reason to change. But let's do everything we can to avoid the collision. We might not be able to figure out how to avoid this accident. If the loop begins again, we'll forget everything we've learned. What do you suggest? If we find a way to avoid this collision, we should send that information into the next loop. Is that possible? We have seen that echoes or after-images from previous loops appear as distortions in the dekyon field. We could send an echo into the next loop. Like a message in a bottle? Exactly. We could enhance a dekyon emission and send ourselves a message. Not a long one, only a few characters. Maybe one word. How will we know to pick up that word? If the dekyon emission is modulated correctly, it will set up resonance's in my positronic subprocessors. I will receive the information on a subconscious level. There's the catch. We don't know how this will be perceived by Data. It might be like a post-hypnotic suggestion. Even so, we've got to try. Take whatever steps are necessary to send a message. Dismissed. It's possible we've tried this 1,000 times and it's never worked. Do you feel that you've done this before? No, I don't. Neither do l. Maybe that's a good sign. Let's test the emitter. Particle accelerators at full power. Dekyon field active. Particle flux nominal. We're in business. All we need now is a message. Senior officers, to the bridge. On our way. We have to figure out how we handled this before. Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow. Aye, sir. Manoeuvring thrusters are not responding. Distortion field is fluctuating. All main systems down. Power levels are dropping. There is an energy build-up. We have to get out of here. Something is emerging. Shields up. Evasive manoeuvres. Shields inoperative. The helm's not responding. The vessel is on a collision course. Impact in 36 seconds. Hail them. No response. Suggestions? Decompress main shuttle bay to blow us out of the way. I suggest we use the tractor beam to alter their trajectory. Make it so, Mr. Worf. Engaging tractor beam. Damage report. Casualties all over the ship. Starboard nacelle sustained an impact. We are venting drive plasma. Emergency core shutdown. Inertial dampers failing. Losing attitude control. This is the bridge. All hands to escape pods. Core shutdown is unsuccessful. We are losing antimatter containment. We've got to eject the core. Ejection systems are off line. Core breach is imminent. All hands, abandon ship! Repeat, all hands, abandon...

I assure you, the cards are sufficiently randomized. I hope so. Something wrong, Mr. Worf? I am experiencing nlb'poH, the feeling I have done this before. Last Tuesday night. That's not what I mean. I've been having the same feeling. Wait! An eight. An ace. A queen. And a four. Deal the cards, Data. Three. All threes. I was positive I knew what cards were going to be dealt. I was also sure. Finish dealing the hand. Look at this. We've all got three of a kind. First we get a three and then three of a kind. Ogawa to Dr Crusher. Go ahead. Cmdr La Forge needs you in sickbay. I'm on my way. At first I thought the catwalk was spinning. It turns out it was me. Luckily, Fletcher grabbed me. It's a long way down to the bottom of the warp core. You have the symptoms of an inner-ear infection. That would explain the headaches and dizziness. But I don't see any physical... What? What is it? Have you had these symptoms before? Now that you mention it, yes. Do you recall when? No, I don't. We've had this discussion before. I remember giving you this examination. Let's check the medical logs. You've been treated for headaches from your visor but no mention of dizziness. Must be déjá vu. Both of us? About the same thing? I'd like to run an optical diagnostic. For an ear infection? I have a hunch. Hold still. This pulse may be a little bright. Have you made changes to your visor lately? No, why? I'm detecting a small phase shift in your visual receptors. Crusher to Capt Picard. Yes? Can you come to sickbay? It's urgent. I'm on my way. Dizziness is from a phase shift in his visual receptors. It's causing him to see things. Like blurry after-images. I ran a scan to see if I could detect what he saw. I picked up distortions in the surrounding dekyon field. His visor seems to be translating them into visual impulses. Could be a malfunction in the warp-field generator. Run a localized subspace scan for anything unusual. Aye, sir. Keep me advised, Doctor. Lateral sensors on line. Subspace scanners active. Data, run a level-two diagnostic on the warp subsystems. All threes. That can't be right. I have encountered the numeral three many times in the last two hours. We have a dekyon-field fluctuation on deck nine, section 28. Crusher to La Forge. Here. I've just heard voices in my room, but there's no one here. Sensors picked up something strange, too. On my way. Dr Crusher. Are you alright? I'm fine. I have isolated three segments of this recording. A localized distortion of the space-time continuum. Collision course. Impact in 36 seconds. All hands, abandon ship! Repeat, all hands, abandon... Worf refers to a distortion. If this were temporal and we were close enough to it, it's possible an explosion ruptured the space-time continuum. We collided, exploded, then got stuck in this repeating loop. If you're right, perhaps we can escape by avoiding collision. That's our guess. Reverse course. For all we know, reversing course might lead to the crash. We can't second guess ourselves. Stay on course until we have reason to change. In the meantime, do what we can to avoid a collision. We've seen the number three all over the ship. On consoles, in a poker game. To date, we have encountered 2,085 examples of the number three. All these threes can't be coming up by accident. Maybe someone is telling us something. We came to the same conclusion, so we ran a diagnostic. We found a dekyon-field modulation in Data's subprocessors. What could be causing it? I don't know. But if I wanted to send information between loops, I might use a dekyon emission. We sent ourselves a message? It would make sense. Maybe we are trying to contact ourselves. If that were true, what could three indicate? We should run a level-three diagnostic. That's a good idea. I'll run an algorithm on three. Bridge to Capt Picard. Go ahead. We have unusual readings, 20,000 kilometres off the starboard bow. On our way. Report. Sensors didn't detect the phenomenon until now. It is a localized distortion of the space-time continuum. On screen. How did we handle this before? Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow. Aye, sir. Manoeuvring thrusters are not responding. Distortion field is fluctuating. All main systems down. Power levels dropping rapidly. There is an energy build-up. We have to get out of here. Something is emerging. Shields up. Evasive manoeuvres. Shields inoperative. The helm's not responding. The vessel will impact in 36 seconds. Hail them. No response. Suggestions? Decompress main shuttle bay to kick us out of the way. I suggest we use the tractor beam to alter their trajectory. Make it so. Engaging tractor beam. The tractor beam will not be successful. I am decompressing main shuttle bay. We are clear of the distortion. Data, what happened? At the last moment, I speculated that three might refer to the rank insignia on Cmdr Riker's uniform. That indicated that his suggestion was the correct course. You must have picked up a message from the last loop and stacked the poker deck without realizing. That is possible. I may also have been responsible for the unexplained occurrences of the number three. Mr. Worf, end red alert. Try to access a Federation time base beacon. Let's see how long we've been in this causality loop. Time base confirms our chronometers are off by 17.4 days. Reset them, Mr. Data. Aye, sir. Captain, we are being hailed by the other vessel. The computer identifies it as USS Bozeman, a Federation starship. Soyuz-class. Soyuz-class? They haven't been in service in over 80 years. Open a channel. This is Capt Bateson of Federation Starship Bozeman. Can we render assistance? I'm Capt Jean-Luc Picard of Federation Starship Enterprise. We were going to ask you the same. Capt Picard, your vessel is not familiar to us. Captain, have you any idea what has happened? Our sensors detected a temporal distortion. Then your ship appeared. We nearly hit you. The Enterprise has been in a temporal causality loop. I suspect that something similar happened to you. You must be mistaken. We left star base three weeks ago. Captain. Do you know what year this is? Of course I do. It's 2278. Perhaps you should beam aboard our ship. There's something we need to discuss. "
S5E19,"Captain's log, star date 45703.9. We are en route to Earth, where I will make the commencement address at Starfleet Academy. I look forward to seeing Wesley Crusher again. His flight team's demonstration near Saturn will be transmitted to the graduation ceremonies. Captain, Starfleet Academy requests our estimated arrival. Mr. Data? We should arrive at Earth in ten hours, 16 minutes. Inform the Academy, Mr. Worf. Send my regards to Superintendent Brand. Aye, sir. Do you know Admiral Brand? We've met a few times. She's a formidable woman. When I was at the Academy, we had a Vulcan superintendent who had memorized all our personnel files. It was like having your parents around. My superintendent was a Betazoid telepath. When you got sent to his office, he didn't have to ask what you'd done. You got called to his office? I'd like to hear that story! Sir, we're being hailed again by the Academy. It is Admiral Brand. On screen. Sir, she is requesting a private channel. In my ready room. Admiral, what can I do for you? Hello, Captain. I know you're a close friend of the Crusher family. Yes. I wanted to inform you personally. There's been an accident. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. He had second-degree burns and a fractured arm, but he'll be fine. Have they completed regeneration? I'm not certain. Wesley's allergic to metorapan treatments. They'll have to use a bicaridine substitute. I'll send his records... Beverly. ..to the infirmary. They probably have them, but you can't be too sure. Beverly, he's fine. I know he's fine. How did it happen? Apparently, his squadron was practising on the Academy flight range near Saturn. They were flying a close formation. There was a collision. All five ships were destroyed. Four cadets transported out. One didn't make it. Do you know who it was? Yes. His name was Joshua Albert. Wesley spoke of him. They were friends. Wesley was so excited to make the flight team. Of course, I was a little nervous, but I was proud. I always knew there was a chance that something like this might... Beverly, Wesley's alive and he's well. There was little to salvage from the wreckage. We recovered one data recorder, but it was badly damaged. We are attempting to restore the information, but it will take time. Standard procedure calls for an immediate investigation by two command-level officers. Capt Satelk and I will be taking depositions from Nova Squadron at 1500 hours today. Cmdr Albert. I'm sure that everyone in this room joins me in expressing my deepest sympathies to you on the tragic loss of your son. There will be a memorial service for Cadet Albert this evening, in the west garden. It has been suggested that we should cancel the graduation ceremonies because of what happened. Cmdr Albert and I have agreed that commencement should go forward. The cadets should know that even after such a tragedy, there are still duties to perform... ..and life continues. Thank you all for coming. It's good to see you again, Captain. I wish it were under better circumstances. This is an unhappy way to begin commencement. If you require any assistance, the Enterprise is at your disposal. I'm sure we'll be able to conduct the investigation. But thank you for your offer. Wes! I was so worried about you. How are you feeling, Wesley? Not bad. The arm's a little sore. We were very sorry to hear about Joshua. Would you like to talk about it? No. I don't think so. No, thank you. I know you want to be helpful, but I've talked about it for days. I don't want to go through it again. I understand. But I'm available if you change your mind. Thank you, sir. Hi. Hi. Captain, sir. At ease, Cadet. This is my squadron leader Nicholas Locarno. Capt Jean-Luc Picard and my mother, Dr Crusher. Hello, Doctor. Hello. Capt Picard. Mr. Locarno. I came by to see if Wes had healed up alright. How are you feeling, Nicholas? I'm OK. I just never lost anyone under my command before. I'm afraid that never gets easier. Captain, Mom,... ..will you excuse us, please? Nick and I have things we need to talk about. Of course. Let me know if you need anything. I will. I'll see you at the inquiry. Good to meet you, Mr. Locarno. You too, sir. The inquiry's scheduled for 1500 hours. You ready? I think so. Don't worry about it, Wes. Everything's gonna be alright, as long as we stick together. Can't you see that's a flowerbed? Sorry! I'm really sorry. Well... Boothby? Jean-Luc Picard. Class of '27. I know that. What happened to your hair? How are you? I'm pretty damn cranky, thank you! I've replanted this bed four times this week. Let me give you a hand. You? I've acquired an interest over the years. Well, don't plant 'em too deep. The stems will... Will rot. Capt Picard. Of the Enterprise, no less. And giving the commencement address! You sound surprised. Surprised? Nothing you ever did surprised me, son. Except when you caught that Ligonian with a reverse body lift, and pinned him in the first 14 seconds of the match. Didn't think you had it in you. Well, it was all in the legs, all that running I did. Boothby? I don't think that I ever... I don't think I ever told you... ..how much I appreciate... There's nothing to tell. Yes, there is. I just wanted to, while I was here... Look, you know as well as I do, I would never have graduated if you... You made a mistake. We've all been young enough to make one. Nevertheless... You did what you had to. What you thought was best. I just made sure that you listened to yourself. At the time I thought you were a mean-spirited, vicious old man. I was. And, by the way, I was about the same age you are now. I didn't speak to you for months. You needed to get your bearings. I knew that. The important thing is, what you did with your life afterwards. Seems you did OK. That's thanks enough for me. Did you know the boy from Nova Squadron who was killed? Josh Albert? Yeah. Crusher, Hajar, Sito, Locarno... I know them all. You nervous? No. Yes. That's OK. So am l. But we're gonna be alright. It'll be tough, but we always come through for each other. Whatever happens, leading this team has been the high point of my years at the Academy. No one could have asked for a better team. Or better friends. Let's go. Here, we accelerated and executed a starboard turn of 27 degrees. We came out of the turn on course for Titan. You were still in the lead position? Yes, sir. Continue. As we approached Titan, I gave the signal to tighten into a diamond-slot formation. Remaining in formation, we executed a low-apogee turn around Titan and began a Z+25 degree climb in preparation for a Yeager Loop. Approximately nine seconds later, Cadet Albert's ship collided with Cadet Hajar's. We had less than two seconds to beam to the evac stations at Mimas. Everyone made it except Josh. Thank you, Mr. Locarno. Cadet Hajar. As team navigator, you filed a flight plan with the range officer before the exercise. Correct? Yes, sir. Did Nova Squadron deviate from that flight plan after you entered the Saturn range? No, sir. Then how do you explain that the low-apogee turn around Titan was 2,000 kilometres closer to the moon than indicated in your plan. We were within flight-safety parameters, sir. That was not my question, Cadet. We had discussed changing our approach after I filed the plan. The final decision was made en route. I didn't consider it significant enough to mention. I apologize for the confusion, sir. I should have been more precise. Did you see Mr. Albert's ship break formation before colliding with you? No, sir. My first indication was when my proximity alarm went off. You may be seated. Did any of you see the collision? No, sir. Cadet Sito, you were in the tail position. You should have seen any sign of trouble from Cadet Albert. Yet you saw nothing? That is correct, sir. Did your attention falter? No, sir. I was flying solely on sensor readings. I had no visual contact with Cadet Albert when he broke formation. Sensor readings? What's wrong? It's unusual to fly on sensors alone during this type of manoeuvre. A pilot relies on visual clues from the others to maintain formation. If you were flying on sensors alone, perhaps you could tell us the orientation of his ship before the collision. I don't know, sir. You were flying a ship, travelling 80,000 kph, with Cadet Albert's ship less than ten metres away, and you don't know what his orientation was? I don't remember, sir. Sir, may l? Go ahead. Admiral,... ..Josh was a good pilot, but lately he'd been having difficulties. He'd get nervous in close fly-bys and pull away in the final seconds. His formation flying was erratic. And you didn't report this? No, sir, I didn't. We'd flown together a long time. I thought he could handle it if I gave him a chance. I was wrong. You are saying that the accident was Cadet Albert's fault? I think Josh got frightened and tried to pull out of the turn prematurely, and then crashed into Cadet Hajar. Josh was our friend. We didn't want him to be remembered as someone who panicked. Please be seated. I am very disturbed by what I have heard here today. By your own admission, you allowed your team-mate to fly when you knew he had difficulties maintaining formation. That demonstrates a serious lack of judgement. I am also disturbed that you did not come forward with this information immediately. We will have data from Mr. Crusher's flight recorder tonight. We will reconvene at 1300 hours tomorrow. Everything's fine. Trust me. The Academy has one of the best reconstructive-analysis labs. There's not much we could contribute. Yes. That may well be. But Wesley's one of our own. Understood, sir. We'll get on it. Good. I spoke to Admiral Brand. She's giving us access to all the physical evidence and testimony. Thank you, gentlemen. You shouldn't have said it, Nick. Josh wasn't to blame. I had to do something. You said we wouldn't have to lie. We all agreed not to lie to them. I didn't lie. Everything I said was the truth. The accident was not his fault! He was my friend, too, Wes. I worked to get him on the team. But he panicked. We don't know that! We do! None of us wanted to say it, but we've all had the same thought. Haven't we? He must've pulled away too soon. I think he got scared. Sito? Wes, you want to protect his memory. We all do. But we have to look out for ourselves now. You want us to tell them everything? We might as well start packing our bags. Are we ready for that? We'll take this one step at a time. This is the report from your flight recorder. It was damaged so badly, the lab could only retrieve a third of the telemetry. And all of it is before the collision. There's no problem here. I don't know if I can do this, Nick. You don't have to lie. Just don't volunteer any new information. The first night I met you, Wes, I knew I wanted you on this squad. You understand what it means to be able to count on someone, because you've been out there, putting yourself on the line. You know you have to be able to count on your team, because your life is in their hands, and their lives are in yours. We promised each other in the beginning that we'd stick together. We were Nova Squadron. Nobody else could say that. Even after we graduated, we tried to get posted on the same duty. We were gonna be a team for a long time. Josh can't be a part of those plans any more. But I think he would still want us to be a team. What do you think? Mr. Crusher? Sir! At ease. Am I interrupting? No. I was just going over my deposition for tomorrow. They told me you'd be here. I found this in Josh's room. I think it belongs to you. Our ski trip. Josh and I went to Calgary. He forgot his sweater, so he borrowed mine. He told me you helped him with his classes. A little. He only needed help in statistical mechanics. Josh's weakness was mathematics. No. He could do it. He just didn't like to. His mother and I thought he'd never get out of calculus. Then he found out what the Academy entrance requirements were like. That turned him around. He studied after class, got a tutor. He really worked hard. Never gave up on anything. And he had a lot of respect for you, and everybody on the team. I realize it was his fault. That everybody could have been killed. And I want to say that... I want to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry that he let you down. Are you ready, Mr. Crusher? Yes, sir. At the beginning of our run to Titan, I'm on the right wing. Where is Mr. Albert at this point? On my port quarter, approximately 50 metres away. We receive the signal to begin the diamond formation. Cadet Locarno is coming into view. We're in a 20-degree turn around Titan. We come out of Titan's gravity about now. That is all the data we were able to recover from the flight recorder. Mr. Crusher, would you describe what happened after you left your orbit of Titan? Once we cleared the moon, Mr. Locarno led us into a Yeager Loop. Approximately nine seconds later, my proximity alarm went off. I tried to veer away but it was too late and I was hit. I lost control of my ship. The power coupling exploded in my cockpit. I don't know how, but I managed to activate my escape transporter. The next thing I remember is finding myself on the evac station on Mimas with the rest of the squadron, except Josh. Do you have anything to add to your testimony? No, sir. Mr. Crusher, will you describe a Yeager Loop? The ships begin in a diamond-slot formation, and climb and loop backwards at a steep angle, and at the peak of the loop, turn over and accelerate in a new direction. Mr. Crusher, did your team remain in formation throughout the loop? Yes, sir. I want you to be absolutely clear on this point. Before the collision, was Nova Squadron in a diamond-slot formation? Yes, sir. Computer, display Saturn NavCon file 6-379. These images are from a navigational-control satellite in orbit around Saturn during a sensor sweep. Computer, freeze image. Magnify sector Gamma three and enhance. This image was recorded when your ships moved into the satellite's range. According to the time index, what you see on the monitor took place seven seconds after Nova Squadron completed the Yeager Loop. Mr. Crusher, are these ships in a diamond-slot formation? No, sir. What is your explanation, Mr. Crusher? I have none, sir. Everything's going to be OK, Wesley. There must be an explanation. Data and Geordi are analyzing the recorder and satellite transmission. Why? There must be something wrong with the data. Maybe it was tampered with. Mom! There must be some explanation. I know you're telling the truth, but the data made it look like you were lying. I've spoken with the other parents. I'm going to ask Admiral Brand to delay the inquiry... Mom! Don't. You can't do that. I'm going to let them ruin your career. You haven't done anything wrong. Mom, don't try to protect me. Please stay out of this. The weeds keep popping up in the pittosporum. Poor plants don't have a chance to grow. You should use a herbicide instead of pulling the weeds with your bare hands. And you could explore space on a holodeck instead of a starship. Boothby, tell me some more about Nova Squadron. Not going well, is it? No, it isn't. Do you remember the parrises squares tournament of '24? The final game against Minsk. It took me three weeks to repair the grounds after the celebration. We had a lot to celebrate. Our team wasn't supposed to win. We were proud of them. Well, the cadets today are just as proud of Nova Squadron. Their celebration when Nova won the Rigel Cup made '24 look like a dinner party. To the other cadets, the members of that team are gods, and that's a hard image to live up to. But Nick Locarno watches out for them, keeps them together. Nick is what makes that team special. He's their coach, surrogate father and best friend. A natural leader. The members of that team love him. If he asks them to do something, they do it, even if it means going right over a cliff. Report. Nothing conclusive. The collision occurred four seconds after the satellite images were recorded. We don't know how they got into the new formation or why they crashed. We unsuccessfully tried 53 computational models in an effort to simulate their movements prior to the crash. There are just too many variables. Speed, attitude, course. Did Wesley's flight recorder indicate anything unusual about the ship? Starboard power flow was fluctuating. But well within operational limits. Fluidic pressure in the landing struts was low, but that shouldn't matter. Wesley opened his coolant interlock before the manoeuvre around Titan. That is unusual. The interlock is closed unless you're checking coolant levels. There's no evidence of Wesley doing that sort of check. Filling the coolant tanks requires an open interlock. That needs a maintenance bay. Why else might you open the valve? Well, to purge the plasma exhaust. That would be hazardous while the ship was in flight. Yeah. The engine would ignite the plasma. Ignite the plasma! That's exactly what they were trying to do. Come. Captain. Can you tell me what this manoeuvre is? It's a Kolvoord Starburst, sir. Five ships crossing within ten metres of each other and igniting their plasma trails. It's one of the most spectacular and difficult demonstrations in precision flying. And it hasn't been performed at the Academy for a hundred years. Why? It was banned following a training accident, sir. An accident in which all five cadets lost their lives. I think that Nicholas Locarno wanted to end his Academy career in a blaze of glory. That he convinced the four of you to learn the Kolvoord Starburst for the commencement demonstration. If it worked, it would thrill the assembled guests, and Locarno would graduate as a living legend. Only it didn't work. And Joshua Albert paid the price. Am I correct? Cadet, I asked you a question! Am I correct? I choose not to answer, sir. You choose not to answer? But you've already given an answer to the inquiry. That answer was a lie. I said the accident occurred after the loop. It did. You neglected to mention that following the loop, your team attempted a manoeuvre that was the direct cause of the crash. You told the truth up to a point. But a lie of omission is still a lie. Do you remember the first day you came aboard this ship? Your mother brought you on the bridge. Yes, sir. You even sat in my chair. I was annoyed. Presumptuous child playing on my ship. But I never forgot how you knew every control, every display. You behaved as though you belonged on the bridge. Later, when I decided to make you an acting ensign, I believed you'd be an outstanding officer. I've never questioned that conviction... ..until now. The first duty of every Starfleet officer is to the truth. Whether scientific, historical or personal truth! It is the guiding principle of Starfleet. If you can't find it within yourself to tell the truth, you don't deserve to wear that uniform. I'll make this simple for you, Mr. Crusher. Either you tell Admiral Brand what really took place, or I will. Captain... Dismissed! Your message said it was urgent. They know what we did. Calm down! Tell me exactly what happened. Capt Picard called me to the Enterprise. He told me he knows. The Kolvoord manoeuvre, the cover-up, everything. He said that if I didn't tell the truth, he would. Does he have any evidence? No, but he knew how it happened! Capt Picard doesn't know anything. He has a theory. Let him tell them what he thinks. They'll ask, ""Is it true?"" We'll say, ""No."" There's no evidence. We'll get off with a reprimand. I can't call Capt Picard a liar. Wesley! We have to hang on just a little bit longer, then this will be over. It's wrong, Nick. Wesley... No! I'll tell them what happened. You're gonna tell them what happened? You? Alone? You're gonna decide what happens to me? To Sito? To Jean? You're gonna decide that? I'm not gonna lie to them again, Nick! I can't live with it. You can't lie to them. You can't live with this. You have to tell them. Who the hell are you? You're gonna turn us in! Wait a minute. You wait a minute! He got to you, didn't he? Picard told you some big story about duty and honour. Must've been a good speech to make you turn your back on your friends. We're Starfleet cadets. We have a duty to the truth. What about your duty to your friends? I got you on this team. I gave you a chance when upperclassmen were waiting in line. I said, ""He won't let us down. He was on the Enterprise."" ""He knows what it's like to trust somebody with his life."" I guess I was wrong. If we all come forward together and tell Admiral Brand... We don't wanna come forward! Sito, Jean and me, we don't have a problem with this. If you do, resign your appointment to the Academy and walk away. Don't make us pay for your guilty conscience. You'd let me do that? You'd let me throw away my career just to save your neck? To save the team! That's more important than you, and more important than me. And if I were in your place, I'd do it without hesitation. But that's me. Capt Satelk and I have gone over your testimony and evidence from the crash. Your statements cannot be reconciled with the data from the NavCon satellite. Your unwillingness to offer any explanation for this contradiction is disappointing, and raises suspicion. We cannot escape the conclusion... ..that either the data is faulty in some way,... ..or you have lied to us. However, suspicion is not proof, and I have no proof that you have lied to this inquiry. Therefore, if no further evidence is presented, I have no choice but to close this investigation. For filing an inaccurate flight plan, and for allowing Cadet Albert to fly when you knew he had difficulties, I'm ordering a formal reprimand placed on each of your permanent records. I'm also revoking your flight privileges. This inquiry is closed. Sir? I wish to add to my testimony. Proceed, Mr. Crusher. Yesterday I testified that the crash occurred following a Yeager Loop. That is not entirely true. We performed the loop, and afterwards broke formation and attempted a Kolvoord Starburst. We knew it was prohibited. We knew it was dangerous. But we wanted to do something spectacular for the demonstration. We pushed Josh into it, and he wasn't ready. We thought we could do it. We thought we could do anything. We were wrong. And Josh died. Josh didn't let us down, sir. It wasn't his fault. Mr. Locarno,... ..you are the leader of Nova Squadron. Do you have anything to say? Mr. Locarno? No, sir. Mr. Locarno has been expelled. They should've expelled all of us. They very nearly did. Mr. Locarno made an impassioned plea for the rest of you. He said he'd used his influence to convince you to attempt the manoeuvre and to cover up the truth. He asked to take full responsibility. He did exactly what he said he would. He protected the team. I feel awful. I've let down everyone. My mother, my friends, you. You should feel bad. And you will pay for what you've done. Admiral Brand decided that, in addition to a formal reprimand, your credits for the year are cancelled and you will not advance with your class. I understand. It's not going to be easy, staying here on campus, everyone knowing what you did. You have difficult times ahead. Yes, sir. Thank you, Captain. You knew what you had to do. I just made sure that you listened to yourself. Goodbye, Cadet. Goodbye, Captain. "
S5E20,"Forward tubes armed and ready. Fire. A direct hit. The asteroid has been shattered. But the core is on a collision course with Tessen III. Is it a threat? Yes. It will cause planet-wide damage. Time to impact? It will reach the atmosphere in 44 seconds and impact 11 seconds later. Ready torpedoes. Aye, sir. Sir, it is unlikely another photon torpedo will be of any effect. Mr. Worf, prepare a tractor beam. Aye, sir. 30 seconds to impact. I am unable to get a lock with the tractor beam. There is magnetic-field interference emanating from the core materials. Activate a deflector. If we send a particle beam, we may produce a disruptive nuclear effect. Aye, sir. Impact in 17 seconds. Beam activated. The target has been destroyed. The remaining debris is of no threat to the planet, sir. Well done, everyone. Ensign, put us back on course. Warp four when we clear the debris field. Aye, sir. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. My instructions were clear. They were not! Before play, he was to put his soiled clothing in the garment reprocessor. I was not! I sense a touch of hostility here. You were specifically told that. You told me yesterday, not today. If I may suggest... The same rule applies today that... Please! Why not simply draw up a contract which clearly defines the duties of each family member? You mean he tells me what he wants and I do it? No. I mean you both agree to your responsibilities. When you do what you've agreed to do, you've earned the privilege to do what you want to do. When he's cleaned his room, perhaps he can visit the holodeck to fight his alien monsters. You suggest bribery. I suggest working out an equitable system with the rules spelled out. For the child and the parent. You must list your responsibilities, too. What would you like your father to promise, Alexander? No yelling. I do... ! I do not yell. You should have no trouble with that part. Why not go back to your quarters and talk this thing over? Decide on which points each of you wants in the contract. Very well. One day, you'll be glad your father cared enough about you to make rules. It may be hard to imagine right now, but eventually, most children come to appreciate their parents. Riker to Counsellor Troi. Your mother's just come aboard. On the other hand... Deanna, my dear! It's Mother! I've got deliciously exciting news! You'll be absolutely thrilled. I'm getting married. You know, with just a bit of redecorating here and there, this ten-forward room should make a very nice wedding hall. I beg your pardon? Where else, my little one, but here amongst my friends and in the presence of my adored daughter? Mother, where did you... When did you meet this man? Who is he? I mean, marriage? When did all this happen? My poor, plodding little Deanna with her questions, questions, questions! Wherever did you inherit such pedestrian genes? What matters is that your mother's happy. Mother, if you're happy, then I'm happy for you. I only asked who he is and where you met him. Those are not unusual questions. He's a wonderful man with such good breeding. He's absolute perfection. Who is he? He is Campio. Third Minister to the Conference of Judges from Kostolain. Royalty. Naturally. I didn't know you'd been to Kostolain. Or was he on some diplomatic mission to Betazed? Well, neither, actually. You see, we haven't exactly met yet, really. But the profiles we've exchanged! They were in such accord that you could weep. You would weep at the harmony between us. Mother, don't you think it would be a good idea if you met the man before spending the rest of your life with him? I love you, but you do make everything sound like an epitaph. I don't want to agree! You have to. That is what an agreement is. Excuse the intrusion, but we're having some difficulty drawing up our contract. Mrs. Troi. He's not fair! The boy is unreasonable. Well, of course he's unreasonable. He's a child. And such a child. Making little boys reasonable only gives them pimples. Alexander, this is my mother. Alexander? What a wonderful name! You know, I once knew a tall, handsome warrior named Alexander. He utterly adored me. We went everywhere. Simply everywhere! Have you been anywhere...? Contract? What contract? Between father and son. A fair and balanced way to achieve a mutual sense of order. How ghastly for you. And you are doing this to your own child, Mr. Woof? Mother... ! It is Worf, madam. Contracts are between people who don't trust one another. A child who is trusted becomes worthy of that trust. Will you stay out of this? If he does not perform his contractual duties, I assume he will be chastised? He will be sanctioned, yes. If you fail to perform your duties, what can the child do about it? Will you please... I? Not perform my duty? Alexander. Now, life's true gift is the capacity to enjoy enjoyment. Now. Have I arrived too late, or can you still smile? She's getting married? Yes. We should rendezvous with her intended in 31 hours. I will not have her using us for her convenience simply because her daughter is one of my officers. Apparently Deanna being on board is only one reason. The other reason being? She thinks the honour of giving away the bride should fall on you. Permission for an on-board wedding is granted. Nothing would please me more than to give away Mrs. Troi. My little warrior! And how are you this morning? I see. Being punished for something, are we? It's just my regular time to meet Counsellor Troi. She's not here yet. Then you're early. That's very responsible of you. No, I just wanted to be out of my room before... Before what? Now, if we're to be real friends, we've got to share only the truth. Why? For one thing, it's easier. When you tell the truth, you never have to remember what you lied about. But mostly, a true friend is a person you can always tell the truth to without worrying about it. I... I wanted to leave before my father got back. I hate him. I wish my mother were here. She died. It's not very fair, is it? All he cares about are rules. I'm supposed to do everything right all the time. I don't know how. To tell you the truth, little warrior, neither do l. But, I do know one marvellous thing we can do with rules. I'm meant to see Counsellor Troi. Exactly. Ever been to a colony of free spirits? What do they do there? Whatever they want. Artists, philosophers, freethinkers, and people who don't quite fit other people's rules. Personally, I come for the mud baths. You're going to adore the mud baths! Computer, I'm assuming that you have the Parallax Colony on Shiralea VI? That program is available. Good! Then run it for us, dear. What's that? A wind dancer! He stands guard. Only those whose hearts are joyous may enter. Come on. Fire sculptor. We'll chat later if you're not wearing anything flammable. Hello. A few of us are just gathering for our laughing hour. Would you care to come laugh with us? Actually, we were about to experience a mud bath. Were you? What an idea. We will join you. One can always laugh in the bath. Do you ever drop one? No! These are my worlds. I protect them. I am a master of worlds. And they fly only as I wish. We're having guests for laughing hour. Care to join us? We'd love to. No, thank you. Yes. No. Why do you always say no when I say yes? I don't. You just did. There you go again. Why are they arguing? They're friends. They love contradiction. They thrive on challenge. They flourish in conflict. Then why are they friends? Who else can you fight with? Hold! What is the lesson for today? Damned if we know. We're just here for some fun and a mud bath. Every moment requires a purpose. No, it doesn't. Every purpose requires a plan. He does this every day, usually while everyone's food is getting cold. It's rather boring. The higher,... ..the fewer. That's a conversation stopper if I ever heard one. You're being stubborn. I am not. You are. I am not! Yes, you are. I am not. Excuse me. If you're gonna argue, you should remember, the higher, the fewer. So, my little warrior wants to see more out of life than just fighting? The mind opens, and in creeps wisdom. Alexander! ""Be patient,"" she says. Come! I can't believe this. Isn't Alexander with you? He didn't show up for his appointment. Computer, what is the location of Alexander Rozhenko? Alexander Rozhenko is on holodeck two. Is he there alone? He is with Lwaxana Troi. To all the creatures within us! ""To all the creatures within us""? Of course. Every one of us has a thousand different little people inside of us. And some of them want to get out and be wild, and some want to be sad or happy or inventive, or just go dancing. That's why we all have different urges at different times. And all those different little people inside of us, we must never be afraid to take them with us wherever we go. Who knows when we may need one of them to pop up and rescue us from ourselves? Variety, my little Alex. The great secret is not the variety of life. It's the variety of us. Are we ready for the entertainment? Yes! Bring on the entertainment. Mother? Little one! Mr. Woof! Come, join us. I'm trying to help the boy learn the value of responsibility. You're not helping by giving him mixed messages. I exposed you to all sorts of mixed messages. You still turned out dull. What are you so worried about? Among other things, his relationship with his father. No more holodeck, Mother. Please. Why aren't you making wedding plans? It's only three days away. I'm letting Mr. Homn handle all the mundane details. He knows my tastes. Mother... There's absolutely nothing to do, you nosy little girl! Campio's sent his mother's wedding gown, which Mr. Homn is altering. There isn't anything else... Wedding gown? Mother, stop. You're not going to be naked at your own wedding? Campio's planet has different traditions. He would not approve of a traditional Betazoid wedding, so I am happily adapting! Simple as that. I need some tea. I can't believe I'm hearing this from the heir to the Holy Rings of Betazed, holder of the Sacred Chalice of Rixx. Why can't I ever work this replicator? Mother... I think it's time to talk about this mysterious marriage to a man you've never met. Computer, some Jestral tea, please. Why shouldn't I get married if I choose to? You make everything into a mystery. There is no mystery, Deanna! Except about this Petrokian sausage. The tea. All I wanted was a cup of tea. Oh, dear, I think your replicator's having a nervous collapse. A diagnostic of the food-replication systems has failed to detect any faults in the terminals. But we've still had over 200 reports of malfunctioning replicators. An energy fluctuation in a utility-access corridor. Well, we'd better look into it before the Captain orders dinner. Yeah. Dash 64. Here we are. Some kind of intermittent EM-field pattern. Gimme a hand with that, will you? There's no plasma leakage. Just a little negative-ion charging. Bad enough having to wear anything at all to my own wedding, but this? Perhaps if we lower the bodice... Raise the hemline, then? What a constant joy you are! Mr. Homn? Alexander! My little warrior. Come here. Come on. Give me a great big hug! Now, you're not escaping another appointment, are you? No, ma'am. Well, I suppose eventually we all have to live up to our obligations. Well, now. Tell me, what brings you here to brighten my day? I wanted to say I'm sorry if I got you in any trouble. That's very sweet, dear, but I really wasn't in any trouble. Until I saw this dress! Ugly, isn't it? What's it for? I'm getting married. Why? Are you sure my daughter didn't send you? Just a joke. People get married because they want to spend their lives with someone. Their whole life? They must like that person a lot. Well, if you're young and lucky, it'll be someone you like a lot, yes. And if you're older... Are you very old? I'm alone, Alex. And when you do get older,... ..and can no longer pick and choose from whatever may come your way,... ..then you do what we call compromise. Keeps you from being afraid. We traced the failure to an interface which routes replicator selections to the correct subprocessors. The interface had been transformed into a gelatinous material we haven't been able to identify. We have an intermittent failure of the inertial-damping system. Take us out of warp. Primary attitude control has failed. Going to secondary. We have lost helm control. Try a manual bypass of the damping systems. Backup generators. Coming on line now. How long before we regain control? Almost there. Ensign, put us back on course. Stay at impulse for now. Did something hit us, Mr. Worf? Negative, sir. The automatic bypass should have kicked in. I want to know what went wrong. Analysis in 30 minutes. What happened to the replicator happened to the stabilizer. The transfers in both systems turned into this. Some sort of corrosion? We do not yet know what it is. There's a conversion process turning the metal into gelatinous residue. The cause is a mystery. Replicators and stabilizers are totally unrelated. And we still don't know why the sensors didn't pick up the problems. Let's run a mass spectrometer analysis and find out what it is. Transporter room one to Capt Picard. Minister Campio is beaming on board. I'll be right there. The bridegroom. Campio! My dear, your compatibility profile doesn't do you justice. I am Lwaxana, and any introductory compliment will be happily received. Indeed, Mrs. Troi, you are even lovelier in person. Now, that worked just fine. Now, now, we don't wish to be too familiar at this early juncture. Forgive this tardiness. Ship's business. Minister Campio, Capt Picard. Welcome aboard. I thank you and greet you with appreciation for permitting this wedding aboard your fine vessel. Not at all, sir. May I present my daughter? Deanna Troi, meet your future stepfather, come to think of it. Yes. If I recall the profile, you are the ship's counsellor? I am, sir. And my escort, who need not be addressed, Protocol Master Erko. Campio? Personally I absolutely adore all the ostentation I can get, but, Protocol Master? I would not do you, nor our hosts, the disservice of failing to ensure that priorities are observed. Yes. How very thoughtful. It would be unpardonable simply to abandon ourselves to the moment. Would it not? Unpardonable! Looks like the only alloy common to both replicator and stabilizer... ..is nitrium. Computer, analyze the nitrium content of both stabilizer and replicator. There is no nitrium in the affected stabilizer or replicator. There is none in the residue either. The elements in the residue have been broken down into simpler structures. That suggests the nitrium has been organically metabolized. Maybe that's it. If a living organism ingested the nitrium... ..this residue would be the waste left behind. If that's true, something's eating away at the nitrium on this ship. That means that the dilithium chamber is vulnerable and the power-transfer conduits. Better get to Engineering. Eat, son. What are you doing? What is that noise? It's my laughing hour. That is enough, please. It is your dinner hour. Eat. I promised to meet Mrs. Troi for another lesson in happy wisdom. Will you stop doing that, please? Alexander, eat your food. Wisdom will wait, I assure you. I promised. Should I break my promise, Father? A Klingon never breaks his word. Where are you going? You said no Klingon breaks his word. I did not mean now. Now just sit down and eat. I don't understand. You're confusing me. Understand later. Just eat. Father? The higher, the fewer. I don't wish to be authoritative, but Erko says now is our proper time for discussion of certain details. I don't want to be considered anti-Erko, dear, but I did promise Alexander one more holodeck trip. Come along, my love. Surely there'll be other occasions for you to spend time with the boy. My goodness, Campio. You and I are going to have the rest of our lives. I tell you what. I'll be back here with you in one hour, alright? Minister, the woman should not be addressing you in the familiar. Mother, we have to talk. Yes we do, dear, but not just now. Well, how do I address him? We've come for Alexander. Forgive the intrusion. Preferably he should be called by his ministerial title. I'll remember. Mr. Homn, you make sure that everyone is comfortable until we get back. Especially the Minister here. I'll be back. One hour, darling. See you then. Mrs. Troi, it is Alexander's dinner hour. How thoughtless of me! I guess we'll have to have a picnic before our mud bath. We have business to deal with here. Leaving is simply not acceptable. Well, can't we just pretend it is? We'll be back. You are missing the point. Alexander, you will return to our quarters and have dinner. But we're going to the holodeck! You're undermining all our efforts. Don't be absurd. Don't they let you change those colourless outfits? It is essential that we discuss the wedding procedures now. Minister, darling, perhaps you and Jerko can come, too. Lwaxana, this exceeds all boundaries. Well, a half-hour, then. No longer, I promise. Mr. Homn? Your duties. Counsellor Troi, have you no influence? Lwaxana, if you will remain, I may allow the boy to stay. Definitely not! Definitely not. My son is to return to quarters. Nor may a servant be present during a prenuptial consultation. Well, sir, I'm afraid even the bride won't be present for this one. The dilithium chamber shows no anomalous readings. So far, these transfer conduits are clean, too. Hold on. I'm getting something here. There's an energy fluctuation in this panel. What happened? Well, I was just juggling and I happened to catch one in my mouth. It tasted good, so I ate it. Before I knew it, I'd eaten up every one of my worlds. It never occurred to me that once they were gone, I'd have nothing left to juggle. If you ever have a world, plan ahead. Don't eat it. Well, now. Almost time to get back. Are you sad? Course not. I'm about to be a bride. You know that man you're marrying? He would never take a mud bath, would he? He might. Probably not. Maybe this would be a good time to get one of those little people that live inside you to come out and tell you what to do, or help you or something. What are you talking about? I'm sorry. No. Don't you dare be sorry. What's wrong? Come along, Alexander. Let's not leave everyone waiting for us. Once we saw that photonic trail, we realized we must be dealing with a metal parasite. We believe they came through the hull after we destroyed the asteroid. Do they attack anything other than nitrium? Not that we can tell, but we've got nitrium everywhere. Computers, life support, ventilation, engines, even the dilithium chamber. The asteroid we destroyed was rich in nitrium. Aye, sir. And that asteroid came from the Pelloris Field. If the field is rich in nitrium, it would be a natural feeding ground. We should go back. The parasites could possibly be lured back to the asteroids. How long to the field? At warp nine, five hours, 20 minutes. Bridge. Riker here. Set a course for the Pelloris asteroid field, warp nine. Captain, with our sensors unable to detect the parasites, and given how fast they move through the ship... We may not have five hours, 20 minutes. Can we slow them down? An exanogen-gas barrier has been known to slow down metal parasites. They don't like cold? Make it so. The problem is finding them. When we spot a fluctuation, they've already consumed the nitrium and moved on. Power is going down. I've rerouted to secondary generators. Inform the bridge. Mr. Data, with me. Bridge. Any suggestions as to how to get the parasites to leave the ship once we reach the Pelloris Field? If we reconfigure a particle beam with a high concentration of nitrium and project it at an asteroid... Then they would follow the beam like a trail of breadcrumbs. Very well. Turbo lift velocity is fluctuating. Computer, halt at next level. Computer, acknowledge! We have reached the bridge, sir. Report, Number One. Ventilation and life support are failing. Captain, we have dropped to warp 5.7. Engineering. La Forge here. What's happening? We're losing speed. The parasites must have gotten into the primary warp controllers. Trying a bypass patch to isolate the backup, but it looks like warp six is about the best I can do. At that speed, there won't be a ship left to reach the Pelloris Field. Do what you have to. Working on it, sir. We are losing life support on decks 11 and 12. Mr. Worf, have Security evacuate all personnel from those decks. Engineering to bridge. We've got warp 6.5, but I don't know how much more we can do here. We need more speed than that. Matter/antimatter injectors failing. I'm rerouteing to secondary power. Watch the antimatter containment for any failure. Atmospheric systems are down 27 percent. Below tolerable oxygen limits. We must evacuate decks 20 to 24. Make it so. Shut down life support to those decks. Direct evacuees to decks nine and ten. Divert emergency life support to those decks. Time to asteroid field? If we maintain our current speed, two hours, 23 minutes, sir. Mr. Data, the rest of us may lose consciousness. If we do, it will be your job to execute the plan as discussed. Aye, sir. Structural integrity of the dilithium chamber is 34 percent. Estimated breach in one minute. Computer, transfer power from warp engines to life support. Transfer complete. Activate Bussard collector. Activated. Breach of dilithium chamber in 40 seconds. Reconfigure hydrogen-plasma mixture to include 30 percent nitrium. Mixture complete. Project emitter beam, heading 042, mark 021. Structural integrity of the dilithium chamber is at 28 percent and holding. Mr. Data? The plan was successful, sir. Well done. Mr. Worf, coordinate your teams with Dr Crusher and Cmdr La Forge. Assess damage and injury. Aye, sir. Captain's log, star date 45733.6. Temporary repairs have been completed. Our attention now turns to matters of a more festive nature. This is intolerable. You'd think she'd get to her own wedding on time. Minister! This is infamous. Infamous! We must leave immediately! Heavenly. Every pore in my body tingles with contentment. Isn't it wonderful how things worked out, Alexander? I wanted to teach you how to grab the joys of living. And you turned around and taught me to not let go of them. How very mutual. We still have to learn how to live in the real world, Mother. All of us. She's absolutely right, Alexander. But only when necessary. You're just supposed to sit here? "
S5E21,"Captain's log, star date 45761.3. In an effort to end their centuries-long war, Krios and Valt Minor have agreed to a reconciliation to be held aboard the Enterprise between their two systems. I apologize for the delay, Ambassador Briam. We had to pick up a group of stranded miners. Please, we are grateful the Federation has taken an interest in the matter. Did Cmdr La Forge provide the cargo-handling provisions? Indeed. However, until we reach the rendezvous with the Valtese, may the cargo bay be off limits to all but essential personnel? I trust that this cargo is not dangerous. No, nothing of the sort. It's quite fragile. And quite irreplaceable. Bridge to Picard. Go ahead. We picked up a distress call from a Ferengi shuttle. Set a course to intercept. Aye, sir. Captain, the timing of our ceremony is critical. It cannot be delayed. We'll be on schedule, don't worry. Excuse me. The Ferengi containment field is collapsing. Within visual range. On screen. Their reactor core is unstable. How many on board? Two, sir. Bridge to transporter room three. Boost your output and lock on. We may need a long-range transport. Standing by. Energize. Got them, sir. Mr. Worf, escort our guests to quarters, not too close to mine. Understood. Unless you can arrange transport, you have to remain on board until we complete our mission. No problem. We are in no hurry. We look forward to enjoying the comforts of your fine ship. Quite acceptable. It's not what we're used to, you understand, but it will do. Perhaps your Captain would invite us to dinner this evening? The Captain dines alone. A pity. That was too easy. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. We worked from your drawings. I hope we're in the ballpark. Ballpark? That's an old human expression. Mr. La Forge hopes we're close to achieving what you want. Computer, run holodeck program Krios One. Enter when ready. Astonishing. It is the ancient Temple of Akadar. It is this temple that bonds Krios and Valt, gentlemen. Two brothers ruled a vast empire from this site, until they were torn apart by their love for an extraordinary woman. This is where the wars began. And this is where they shall end. There are some details to be added. Cmdr La Forge is at your disposal. Let me know what you need. Of course. I must consult several historical volumes. Perhaps we can reconvene later. Excuse me! Is it true? Is a Kriosian ambassador aboard this vessel? Yes. Can I help you? The Ambassador's busy. Do you schedule his appointments? I'm the Captain. What do you want? Allow me to present myself. Par Lenor of the Ferengi trade mission. We are pleased you're here, that you have at last negotiated peace with the Valtese. Peace is good for trade, unless you're an arms merchant. Excuse us. Arms merchant! In exchange for exclusive rights to transport all Kriosian products to the Valt system... May I suggest that you meet after the ceremony? Perhaps that would be best. Listen! Have you seen the dolphins yet? Deck seven. Picard to Worf. Worf here. A Ferengi just waylaid Ambassador Briam. Keep them under a tight leash. Don't let them disrupt the conference. Aye, sir. Security to cargo bay one. Lieutenant? One of the Ferengi. Riker to Capt Picard. What are you doing? This is a misunderstanding. I was looking for a barber. I made an incorrect turn. Mr. Worf? Get him out of here. Confine them both to quarters. Put a guard on their door. What is happening? Emergence. I am for you, Alrik of Valt. No, Kamala. This is not Alrik. This is Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise. That's why you don't look like your holographs. I apologize. As an empath, I sensed your authority. I assumed you were Chancellor Alrik. I require an explanation. As do l. Why have I been brought out of stasis? An accident. This is quite complicated. Perhaps you and l... It is not complicated. The Captain has no tolerance for prevarication. I'm a gift. To Alrik of Valt. You're using this ship to transport a sentient being as property? Not as property. As a gift. I was concerned that you might not understand. Your concern was well justified. You're angry. Why? There is a provision in the Federation Constitution that protects an individual's rights. Once aboard... You're coming to my rescue. What a kind and generous purpose. But I do not need to be rescued. Kamala is the key to peace between our worlds. Why? In our history, the woman Garuth was loved by Krios and Valt with such passion that an empire fell. The wars began when Krios took her to our planet. Like her, I'm an empathic metamorph. The first female metamorph in my world for 100 years. A metamorph? A mutant. A biological curiosity, if you will. With the ability to sense what a potential mate wants. What he needs. What gives the greatest pleasure. And then to become that. You change for the man you're with? Until I reach final bonding, when I imprint upon myself the requirements of one man. To serve as his perfect partner in life. You see, male metamorphs are somewhat common, but females are born only once in seven generations. Obviously, they are greatly sought after as mates. Explains the Ferengis' interest. This mating with Alrik was arranged since her birth by the leaders of both worlds, in the hopes of restoring peace. You do this of your own accord? It is my sole purpose in life. Cmdr Riker, escort her to quarters. There's no need for you to travel in the cargo bay. Kamala, remain in your room. I will speak with you shortly. Why were you in stasis? Metamorphs have a long and complex sexual-maturing process. I'm in the Finiis'ral, the third and final stage. It can be uncomfortable, not only for me but for the men around me. In what way? My body is producing an unusually elevated level of pheromones. The effect can be provocative. Perhaps you sense it? Unfortunately, I'm not an empath. I think you're more empathic than you admit. At least when it comes to women. I think you have me at a disadvantage. This is the comm panel, the replicator. You can lower the lights. Any questions, ask the computer. I'm beginning to sense the elevated pheromones you referred to. You were curious, weren't you? Curious isn't exactly how I'd describe it. You know what's remarkable about metamorphs? There's something more remarkable about you? We learn so quickly what stimulates a man that the second time's even better. Listen. This has been very educational, but I never open another man's gift. I know my role in history, Commander. But it's gonna be a long voyage. It certainly is. We'll try to make you as comfortable as possible. Riker to bridge. If you need me, I'll be in holodeck four. How can you deliver her into a life of virtual prostitution? Beverly! Arranged marriages have been the basis of many cultures. I'm surprised at you. She knows what she's doing. She has been conditioned since birth to exist only to please men. She was born for this. And bred to seal a treaty with a seductive coup de gráce. Alright! Let's throw the Prime Directive to the winds. Let's detain her against her will. Let's destroy any chance of peace. Let's interfere in their society, their customs. That slave-trader who calls himself an ambassador has her confined to quarters. She is a virtual prisoner in there. I didn't know that. Well, it is your ship. Maybe you should find out. I'll talk to her about it. Good. Lovely breakfast. Indeed. Come in. Capt Picard, what a delightful surprise. Come in. Thank you. Are you comfortable? Reasonably, under the circumstances. It was brought to my attention that you were told to remain in here. That's true, I'm afraid. Against your wishes. At the request of the Ambassador who believes I might be disruptive to your crew. The performance of my crew is not his business. You care about my well-being. Thank you, Captain. I care about... I care about what happens on board my ship. Yes, I know. This ship is very important to you. Yes. Yes, it is. Are all captains' lives so solitary? Or just yours? Don't. What? Don't do this. This... you do with men. I'm afraid my premature emergence has left me a little vulnerable to desires I sense from men. Nevertheless, this is who I am, Captain. You might as well ask a Vulcan to forego logic, or a Klingon to be non-violent. I cannot change. And I don't want to until I bond with my permanent mate. Why does it bother you? Frankly, it's difficult for many of us to accept that a sentient being can live only to be what someone else wants. But that's what gives a metamorph pleasure. But what about your wishes? Your needs? They are fulfilled by what I give to others. But what about when there are no others? When you're alone? I'm incomplete. What curious questions, Captain. Under the circumstances, I thought that it would help if I learned more about you. But you know me better than you realize. I'm independent, forceful, brilliant and adventurous. Exactly as you would have me be. I'll speak to the Ambassador about easing your restrictions. Thank you, Captain. Captain's log, star date 45766. 1. We have reached the designated coordinates and await the arrival of Chancellor Alrik. I forbid it. Forbid it? It's too dangerous. She must remain in her quarters. You cannot confine her against her will on this ship. She requests freedom of movement. I will give it. She is still in the Finiis'ral, the height of her sexual allure. Every man on this ship will be fighting over her. Not every man. A chaperone? I would be pleased to escort you. But I hoped we might spend more time together. I shall be busy with the conference. I'm knowledgeable about Valt. I could be helpful. I think you should enjoy our hospitality. Mr. Data will see to your every comfort. The reason your powers do not perceive anything is because, as an android, I have no emotion. I can understand why Capt Picard chose you to be my chaperone. I'll check in with you later. Excuse me, but I'm certain that we met at Paloris Colony. I've never been there. Neither have l. Why don't we find out what else we have in common? Extremely rude behaviour. He's just being playful. Something to drink? What are you having, boys? Aldorian ale's our drink. Then it's mine, too. Bartender. They have a minor problem. They could use a hand. Excuse me. I believe I will stay. Mr. Data's protecting me. Protecting you? From what? From you. I told the Captain not to worry. I just want to have a good time like anybody else. Come down to deck seven for a good time. Get rid of the android. We'll have some fun. Is there a problem here? No, sir. No problem. Thank you, Lieutenant. The crowd seemed a bit too ebullient. Perhaps you would enjoy a visit to the arboretum? Perhaps the Ambassador is right. I should remain in my quarters. I have confidence in the self-control of my crew, but there are guests and civilians on board. I understand. I will volunteer to stay in my quarters on one condition. That you visit me. There it is again. What? The wall you put between us. Kamala, you are one day away from an arranged mating. Why would you want me to visit you in your quarters? I said a visit. I didn't ask you to make love to me. Ventanian thimble. Early Lapeongical period, isn't it? Yes, it is. Have you seen the woven art from the fourth colony dig? Woven art? Recovered intact? They say the colours are remarkably vibrant. I've read about them, but no one expected to find any preserved. How do you know about them? I stay informed on a wide variety of subjects. One never knows when conversation might turn to Ventanian archaeology. Or to the dark woman of raven brows and mournful eyes in Shakespeare's sonnets. Or to the gardens of Les Eyries near the village where you grew up. Your empathic powers told you all this about me? Not quite that much. Mr. Data helped a little. I see. My empathic powers can only sense a man of deep passion and conviction. So controlled. So disciplined. I'm simply curious to know what lies beneath. Nothing. Nothing lies beneath. I'm really quite dull. I fall asleep each night with an old book in my hands. When a metamorph finds you interesting, do not take it lightly. I'm not taking it lightly. I'm just trying... ..to be as dull as possible. Will you visit me? It would be inappropriate. Is that a yes or a no? I'm sorry. Even the walls of Jericho fell, Captain. Why are you doing this? There can be only one reason. Some part of you wants me to. Ambassador. What is the meaning of this? I see you got our message. Is this some sort of bribe? I am not amused. No. Your attitude is quite understandable. This is just a sample. The bribe is 10,000 more. Ludugial gold. The purest in the galaxy. We know the lifestyle of a Kriosian ambassador is far from comfortable. You deserve to live a life of luxury. How dare you suggest... ! Our money! You drive a hard bargain. 20,000, but not an ingot more. We must have the metamorph. She is the answer to a Ferengi prayer. We have a ship rendezvousing in three hours. We can all transport off together. Thank you for sharing that information. I shall tell Capt Picard. You can't do that. Stop! Let go of me. Captain's log, supplemental. The Ferengi have been dispatched to Star base 117. What charges will be brought depends on whether Ambassador Briam recovers. We've stabilized his condition. If we're lucky, he'll regain consciousness in a few days. Set up a level-one craniosacral display. I'll inform the Valtese delegation that the conference has to be postponed. That won't be possible. My ability to imprint on a mate lasts a matter of hours after the completion of the Finiis'ral. If I hadn't been removed from stasis, a delay might have been possible. But now I have to bond with Alrik within two days. There are points in the negotiation that Briam has to address. You are familiar with the issues. Familiar, yes. But... ..l can't represent your people's interests. You can represent the interests of peace. My people will agree, I'm certain of it. But there are customs of which I have no experience. I told you, I'm extremely knowledgeable about Valt. I will help you prepare. That's right. I'm reminded of piano lessons when I was a child. Preparing for some dreaded recital. You still play? No. I regret that I gave it up. It pleased my mother. But I didn't like performing in front of an audience. Shy? No. Just not very good. Thank you. For letting down your guard, if only for a moment. You will have to help me in the pronunciation of this scroll. What is it about me you fear? Kamala... Do you find me unattractive? I find you unavailable. I'm being terribly selfish. I apologize. We have something in common. When I was a child, I took music lessons. Really? What instrument? All of them. The entire orchestra? Plus Valtese horns that sound like braying Targhee moonbeasts. They are said to soothe the nerves of Valtese men. My mother never even heard me play. I was taken when I was four and sequestered in a royal village, where I was prepared for my destiny. It sounds a very lonely time for you. On the contrary. I had servants and tutors at my side constantly. You once asked what I'm like when I'm alone. I've never been. There was always somebody there to educate me in literature, history, art, sex. But I've been alone on this journey and I find myself thinking about the curious questions you asked. You wanted to know who I am. And as I ask myself, the only answer that comes is, ""I am for you, Alrik of Valt."" Because that's the truth. In a day, I will bond with a man I've never met. I will turn myself into what he wants me to be, for the rest of my life. I also once asked you if you were doing this of your own accord. I'm honoured to serve my people as an emissary of peace. But it is ironic that, on the eve of the ceremony which I've spent my entire life preparing for, that I should meet a man like you. Riker to Picard. Go ahead, Number One. The Valtese ship has arrived. Chancellor Alrik is ready to beam aboard. Capt Picard. Chancellor Alrik. Welcome on board the Enterprise. Your first officer has described the incident with the Ferengis. How is the Ambassador? He is not conscious. A tragedy. Your willingness to assist is appreciated by both our peoples. I'm doing my best, although I find some of the rituals rather demanding. Rituals? I'm more concerned about the provisions of the treaty. The proposed trade agreements are not acceptable. We must review the uncommitted territories and discuss the schedule for the exchange of technology. The Kriosians authorized me to make compromises favourable to you. Good. Tomorrow, then. Briam supervised a reproduction of the Temple of Akadar on our holodeck. Such a sentimental people, these Kriosians. It's hard to believe we have a common ancestry. Please. I suppose they've sent the metamorph. Kamala? Yes. She's looking forward to meeting you. I'm sure she'll be satisfactory. Between you and me, Captain, I am far more interested in the trade agreements. So tell me quickly. What is he like? First impressions? He's a thoughtful man. Informed. Did he ask about me? Yes. What did you tell him? That you were looking forward to meeting him. When am I to be presented? It'll be the first order of business tomorrow. At ten. Would you like some tea? Thank you, but I should prepare for the ceremony. Let me help you with pronunciations. I can muddle through. Please don't leave. Talk to me. I love the sound of your voice. I'll turn out the lights and just listen. I don't want to be alone. The lights stay on. Earl Grey tea. Hot. Did you learn that from Data? I shall have to talk with him. Now that I know that you're listening to my voice, I can't think of anything to say. A starship captain must encounter all sorts of life forms. Am I one of the most unique you've ever met? Please say yes. Yes. What a nice thing to say. Have I not done everything possible to discourage this? Maybe that's the perfect way to attract a metamorph. I won't use you as other men do. But you're not other men. You could never use me. That's the very reason why I'm with you tonight. I should go. And you have an appointment tomorrow morning early. Light years away. Quiet this morning. I'm sorry. Penny. What? Penny for your thoughts. Do you have one? I'm sure the replicator will have one. Beverly, may I take off the uniform? Captain... I need to talk to a friend. Of course. Actually, it's all your fault. Mine? You insisted that I look into her situation. The metamorph? The metamorph. Kamala. I've spent quite a lot of time with her. And you're right about several things. Her entire existence has been orchestrated for this moment, and she intends to go through with it to help her people end the war. You're saying there's nothing you can do about it? It isn't that simple. I barely know who she is, and... And who she is changes the moment the next man comes in. And I find myself hoping that the next man won't come in. But, of course, he does. In a few hours, the ceremony will begin, and she will... She will mate with a man who cares more about trade agreements than he cares about her. I can't help thinking how she will be with him. How she will change to accommodate him. I wish I knew how I could help. Perhaps I just needed a shoulder. It's there for you, Jean-Luc. It always has been. Come in. Is it time? Soon. Do you have any questions about the ceremony? Many. I will never truly love him. You've not even met him. It no longer matters. I wish I could convey what it's like to be a metamorph. To feel the inner strength of someone. To realize that being with him is opening your mind and heart to endless new possibilities. To hear yourself say, ""I like myself when I'm with him."" Kamala. For a metamorph there's no greater pleasure, and no greater wish than to bond with that kind of mate as I've bonded with you. With me? Who I am today, I will be for ever. Data to Capt Picard. Not now. But, sir, Chancellor Alrik is waiting to receive you in holodeck seven. Acknowledged. You can't go through with the ceremony. Would you ask me to stay and ask two armies to keep fighting? Having bonded with you, I've learnt the meaning of duty. He'll never know. I'm still empathic. I will be able to please him. I only hope he likes Shakespeare. I am for you, Alrik of Valt. Your service to both our peoples is appreciated, Captain. Your preparations made the negotiations simple. Kamala was able to guide me through the rituals. I must admit, I'm curious. Curious? I was chosen for this mission for a simple reason. I'm 200 years old. The temptations of a beautiful metamorph do not easily reach me. Yet I would be lying if I were to claim they do not reach me at all. But you, you worked with her side by side for days. How could you resist her? Ambassador, have a safe trip home. Energize. "
S5E22,"I like to cook all kinds of stuff. Yoghurt-and-raisin salad. Chocolate-chip pancakes and purple omelettes. Purple omelettes? You put grape juice in the eggs. Isabella doesn't like it. She says it tastes funny. I can see her point. Would you like sugar with your tea? Yes, please. Isabella, would you like some? Yes, but she takes two cubes. I'll bet Isabella is very pretty. She's very, very pretty. She has blonde hair and a blue dress with white buttons. Her ears are pierced and she's tall. You could draw a picture. I'd love to see what she's like. You don't think she's real. I think she's real for you and that is real enough for me. Honey, time for you to go. You don't want to keep Keiko waiting. I have to go plant the nasturtiums. I'm Keiko's help in the arboretum. Is that so? Go ahead, sweetie. Be home in time for dinner. I hope I see you soon. Maybe we can be friends. OK. Counsellor Troi? Yes? Isabella says she likes you. Why, thank you, Isabella. I understand your concern, Ensign Sutter. But you have nothing to worry about. It's normal for children to engage in imaginary play. Yeah, I'm just afraid she's not making real friends. She spends all her time with Isabella. You've moved from starship to starship since Clara was two. Maybe Isabella provides a constant companion. She knows this is one friend she won't have to leave. You're probably right. Give Clara a chance. Once she makes new friends on the Enterprise, you'll probably find she leaves her imaginary world behind. Captain's log, star date 45852. 1. The Enterprise has arrived at FGC-47, a nebula which has formed around a neutron star. We are eager to investigate this unique formation. Elevated quantities of hydrogen, helium and trionium. Shields up. Take us in. One-quarter impulse. Aye, sir. In order for the sensors to complete their observations, more processing time is required. We could steal a couple of hours from the Engineering team. Is two hours enough to complete a high-resolution series? No problem. Just double up the main sensor bandwidth. And after dinner, then what? We went to the holodeck and took a walk on the Champs Elysées. The neural scanner still seems off. Let's check the calibrations. I'll run a diagnostic. And? And? After Paris? He has shore leave next month. He asked me to go to Risa. No problem. Nurse McClukidge can cover for you. I don't think I'm going. I hear it's very uninhibited. I don't think I'm ready for that kind of fun. Try to talk him into Tavela Minor. They have a Jokri River cruise. The iridescent currents are beautiful. See, Isabella? You have to stick your finger into the soil, as far as it will go. I'm making a hole for the seeds. Now they need to be watered. But the baby seeds are very small. We mustn't give them too much to drink. Hello? Is anybody there? Hello. Isabella? Hello, Clara. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Isabella. How come I can see you? Is something wrong with how I look? No. It's just I've never seen you before. Not for real. Well, now you can see me for real. Doesn't that make you happy? Yes. It's wonderful. Can we go now? We'd better finish planting the seeds. I'm tired of planting. Let's do something else. Like what? Like... I would really like to explore the ship. We'd better finish planting first. I promised Keiko. We can finish later. Let's go look around. I'd better ask my daddy. Your daddy won't mind. We can tell him later. Come on. What will we call this nebula? FGC-47 doesn't have the proper ring to it. Why don't we call it Sutter's Cloud? The rotational period of the star is 1.35 seconds. That's long. Get a reading on the particle flux. Aye. I was thinking along the lines of the La Forge Nebula. It's got a majestic sound. Given the selections, I prefer FGC-47. What was that? We hit something. The shields registered an impact. The sensors show nothing. Forward velocity is down by 0.2 percent and dropping. Engineering, report. Something could be wrong with the shields. We're checking. Systems are normal, sir. Did we hit something? Shields say yes, sensors say no. This is very strange. Ensign, give me a breakdown on the shield-energy conversion... Where did you come from? I'm Clara Sutter. That's my daddy. Clara, you can't be here now. But Isabella wanted to see Engineering. I don't care about Isabella. Go back to our quarters. But, Daddy... Our speed is still dropping. I hear you. I'm increasing power. But velocity isn't consistent with engine output. Explanation. Something is increasing the drag coefficient. We can't find the source. We may have to leave the nebula. Give me a couple of minutes. Clara, now. I'm sorry. Why do you keep disappearing like that? The grown-ups don't believe I'm real. When they're around, I have to be invisible. Wait here. The drag coefficient continues to increase. Velocity has fallen by 12 percent. Velocity is increasing. Speed stabilized at one-quarter impulse. Great. What did you do? I did nothing. The problem seems to have corrected itself. Where did you go? There was something I had to do. I have no explanation. We seemed to hit something, then started losing speed. But there's nothing to hit. Could a damping field cause us to lose velocity? We have simulated fields but have not reproduced the same drag. We still don't know why it corrected itself. It seems a unique phenomenon. One that hasn't been recorded. Do we stay and check it out? Might be dangerous. Since we only experienced it once, it is impossible to estimate risk. I'd like to stay here and collect samples of the gaseous matter. See what it tells us. Agreed. Collect your samples, Mr. La Forge. We will proceed with caution. Dismissed. What's in here? That's the door to the cargo bay. We can't go in there. Let's go someplace with a lot of people. OK. Isabella, why are you so serious lately? What do you mean? You haven't even smiled once today. You're my best friend, Isabella. Why? I don't know. We do things together and we trade secrets. Does everybody have a best friend? If they're lucky. Before I had you, I didn't have one. Why not? Every time I made friends, my daddy's job would change. We'd move to a new ship. It takes time to make a best friend. How long? Depends. With you, not very long. You always listened to me, even when I was sad. Clara, I'm glad we're best friends. Race you. OK. Ready, set, go. This area is not designated for children. Are you lost? Where are you supposed to be? We're only playing. We're sorry. Return to your quarters. And we will forget this incident. Thank you. Come on. OK. I've configured the magnetic coil to collect gaseous matter. Activate the emitter. The fractionator is on continuous. We'll collect from eight random sections. That ought to give us a reliable measure. Commander, I understand you had a parent in Starfleet. Two of them. My father was an exozoologist, my mother a Command officer. They must have been posted to a lot of assignments. That's putting it mildly. We were always on the move, some of the time together, sometimes separately. I never knew if I'd be stationed with my father while he studied in the Modean System, or in the Neutral Zone with my mom. Was that hard? I don't see it that way. It must've been disruptive if you couldn't make friends. Well, some aspects of my childhood were less than ideal. But, to me, it was one long adventure. Children are stronger than you think. As long as they know you love them, they can handle anything. Thanks, Commander. No, it's a Samarian coral fish with its fin unfolded. I believe you see the effect of the dynamic processes inherent in the motion of rarefied gas. No. First it was a fish. Now it's a Mintonian sailing ship. Where? Right there. Don't you see the two swirls forming the mast? I do not see it. It is interesting that people find meaningful patterns in things that are random. I have noticed that the images sometimes suggest what they are thinking about at that moment. Besides, it is clearly a bunny rabbit. Looks as though someone's lost their way. Excuse me. Hello. Are you looking for someone? No. I brought Isabella to see ten-forward. I see. Ordinarily, we only let you in with a grown-up. But since you brought Isabella, you can be my guest. Won't you join me? Thank you. Now, how about two papalla juices with extra bubbles? Just one, please. Isabella isn't thirsty. One juice. You aren't like other grown-ups. No? They don't think Isabella's real. Most grown-ups have a hard time with things they can't see. Why? Because they get preoccupied by other things. Like what? Like how much fuel it takes to power a ship, or whether we should go to one star system or another, or whether little girls should go to bed at seven or eight. So their heads get so full, they forget about things that are important to you and me, like imaginary friends. If they don't understand, how come you do? Maybe because when I was your age, I had one. You did? What was she like? It wasn't a she. What was he like? It wasn't a he. It? It was a Tarkassian razor beast. It had dark brown fur and gold eyes and huge spiny wings. It would fly past so fast, nobody could see it but me. It sounds scary. It was, especially when he smiled. But the best thing about him was that I could curl up on his furry belly and he had the softest purr you ever heard. It put me right to sleep every night. I tell you, that razor beast was a good friend. So is Isabella. Hello, Clara. Hello. Clara, Isabella and I were just having a conversation. Would you and Isabella like a walk? I guess so. Bye. Bye, Clara. Bye, Isabella. Clara. You haven't been here long, maybe you don't know, but ten-forward is usually for grown-ups. I know that. I didn't wanna go, but Isabella wanted to see it. If Isabella is making you do things you know are wrong, tell her it's not acceptable. I try to but she doesn't listen. Deck 32. Clara, do you want me to talk to Isabella? Isabella. It's not nice to get Clara to do things that she isn't supposed to. She's over there. From now on, I want you to ask a grown-up before you go to any place that's off limits. What does she say? She said... Clara, please tell me what Isabella said. She said, ""You'd better leave us alone."" I'm concerned at the turn this is taking. Clara is doing inappropriate things and blaming them on Isabella. She came into Engineering. She said it was Isabella's idea. I don't think it's serious. We should make an effort to get her involved with real friends. The children's centre has a ceramics class. Why don't I take Clara? She'd like that. I'll see if there's any room left. In the meantime, you should make yourself more available to Clara. Let her know she doesn't have to rely on Isabella to talk to. Counsellor, thank you. Are you mad at me? I'm sorry I got you into trouble. That's OK. Are we still best friends? Here, you can help me put this together, if you want. Clara, why are grown-ups so mean? They're not mean. They're just more serious than we are. Sometimes I wish they would just go away. You do? Yes. I don't like them. I'm bored. Let's go back to Engineering. We're not allowed there. I thought we were best friends. We are. Why won't you play with me? I told you. You always listen to grown-ups. You don't care about me. That's not true. I thought we'd have fun once you could really see me. I thought you'd like me. Let's go to Engineering, Clara. Just for a little while. No one will know. It'll be our secret. If they find us, we'll tell them we got lost. Who is it? Counsellor Troi. Hello, Clara. Hi. I came to ask if you'd like to go to a ceramics class. Can Isabella come, too? No. Let's do something with Isabella another day. Well, OK. Sir, as we move deeper into the nebula, sensors indicate the levels of helium and trionium continue to rise. Can the shields handle it? We are within tolerance levels. Mr. Data? Shields have registered an impact. But the sensors show nothing out there? There is no indication of anything nearby. Forward velocity is dropping. Down by 0.4 percent. Can we go to warp speed? Until we determine the cause, I would not recommend it. Forward velocity down by 1.1 percent. Increase power to impulse engines. Aye, sir. Impulse engines now at full power. We are no longer losing speed. Forward velocity is steady. The drag coefficient is present but it has stabilized. Bridge to Riker. Check with La Forge. See if he found anything in the sample. On my way, sir. Any luck? Yeah. Look at this. We tried radiating it with everything we could think of. We didn't find anything until we subjected it to a high-frequency warp field. We think this is what we ran into. Do you know what it is? We think so, now that the sensors can read it. A highly cohesive form of plasma, a strand of energy. We figure it's part of a network of larger strands. When they come into contact with our shields, the resonant effect creates the drag coefficient. Anything like this on record? No, sir. Do you know how many there are? No, but if we run the warp field through the deflector, we could radiate a field outside. We'd be able to see for ourselves. Let's do it. Alexander, I thought you might like a partner. This is Clara Sutter. She's new here. Clara, meet Alexander Rozhenko. I'm making a cup for my father. Wanna help? Go ahead. Well, you're supposed to put them in a row. Like this. Clara, would you like some clay of your own? Here, honey. I've never made a cup before. How do you make the round part? Well, it's easy. You take a big piece of clay and push your hand into it. Warp-field generators standing by. Captain, we should illuminate any strands within 2,000 kilometers. Proceed. Initiating field generation. Remarkable. It is an irregular lattice composed of 47 million strands of energy. With this many of them, the effect on our shields could cause a problem. Agreed. Ensign, take us out of the nebula. It may be difficult. I detect a significant number behind us. Do your best. Aye, sir. Hot chocolate. Computer, I need my appointment schedule for next week. Kryonian tigers aren't so scary. I saw one once. You did? My father took me to the zoo on Brentalia. All the tiger did was lick my hand. And he smelled funny. I think we need more water. I'll get some. Isabella? Clara! I didn't do it. Who did? It was Isabella. I don't see anybody. She's invisible. I spent two weeks on that. That was really mean. I didn't do it. I didn't. Clara! There's no such thing as invisible people. You're lying. Isabella, stop! Clara. Why were you being so mean to me? Why did you do that to my friend? Because you ran away from me. You left me alone. I had to do everything by myself. You're scaring me. I was going to protect you. I liked you. But now I don't care. Now, when the others come, you can die along with everyone else. Status, Mr. Data. At our current speed, we will clear the nebula in 12 minutes, four seconds. Continue the sensor sweep. I want all the information we can gather. Captain, forward velocity is down by 0.6 percent. Velocity down by 2.4 percent. Mr. Data? We are moving through a dense concentration of strands. Can we go to warp? Stress on the hull would be too great. Captain, the density appears lower off the starboard bow. Ensign, bring us to 030, mark five. Aye, sir. Forward velocity holding. Steady as she goes. Something wrong with the cake? Excuse me? I see you with a piece of untouched chocolate cake. I assume something's wrong with the cake or with you. I'm sure the cake's fine. I've just been thinking. Let me guess. The girl with the imaginary friend? I'm wondering if I'm doing the right thing. How so? Well, I know the best thing is to wean her from her fantasy. And she did make some new friends today. But? But I can't help feeling I'm taking something from her, something precious, a part of childhood she'll never have again. Well, I'm not sure about that. I was just telling Clara about my imaginary friend. You have an imaginary friend? A Tarkassian razor beast. It protected me. I knew as long as that razor beast was around, nothing could hurt me. Over the years, his body kind of faded away, but the idea stayed. I don't seem to talk to him as often. You still talk to it? Yeah. When I'm afraid or I get confused or a little scared. I don't think you have to give up an imaginary friend. Ensign Sutter to Counsellor Troi. Go ahead. Would you come to my quarters? It's Clara. I'm on my way. She won't even go into her room. She's terrified Isabella will hurt her. Clara? Your father tells me that Isabella has been saying bad things. What did she say? She said they're going to kill everyone. Who's going to kill everyone? The others, like her. Did she say why? I know you're very frightened. Sometimes, what we imagine can be as scary as something real. But I promise you, there is no way Isabella can harm you or anyone on this ship. But she's not imaginary any more. She's real now. I can see her. You can see her? Yes. If I go with you and hold your hand, will you go into your room? I think so. We'll make sure Isabella isn't anywhere around, OK? Come on. Do you see anybody? Let's look under the bed. Is she there? OK. Where else? Is she behind here? Maybe Isabella's gone home. Let's see. Anything here? Maybe Isabella knows that you've got new friends now. In fact, I'll bet she doesn't come as much any more. Maybe. What about in the closet? OK. Anybody in here? Looks pretty empty to me. She was 11, maybe 12. Blonde hair. Clara! Clara's sleeping. She's going to be fine. Her bioelectrical processes were severely disrupted. It's as if the energy was pulled out of her body. Captain. Clara told me that her imaginary friend has been making threats. She claimed that others were on the way and they had plans to kill everyone on the ship. Picard to Lt Worf. Worf here, sir. Lieutenant, we've established the presence of an alien entity. That the entity manifests itself as a 12-year-old human girl, who was seen with Clara Sutter. Blonde hair, blue eyes. And a blue dress. Yes, sir. I have seen her. When? Two days ago, near Engineering. She was with Miss Sutter. Security alert, Mr. Worf. Keep a good lookout. She insisted on talking to you. It's about Isabella. What about her, Clara? Her feelings were hurt. She said she liked me and she liked being with me. She was my friend. She only got mean when I stopped paying attention to her. Did she say when the others were coming? Thanks, sweetie. Go back to bed. We'll handle this. But, Daddy... Clara. If we need your help again, I hope we can count on you? Yes, Captain. Capt Picard to the bridge. On my way. Report. Our speed is down by 22 percent. Strand density is ten times what it was. We can't take much more. All stop. Sir, something is moving toward us, bearing 103, mark 024. On screen. It appears to be an energy vortex of complex patterns. Possibly a life form. Red alert. It is in contact with our shields. Shield strength dropping to 75 percent. 72 percent. It's feeding off our shields. Mr. Data, remodulate our shield frequencies. Aye, sir. No effect. Shield strength at 64 percent. We've got eight minutes before it drains our shields. Any ideas? Isabella? Isabella? Don't you want to talk to me? I'm not mad at you. Isabella? We know you've been on this ship for some time now, and that you're posing as Clara's friend, and you've been threatening her. We can only assume there is some connection between yourself and the life forms attacking this ship. You're obviously an intelligent being. There's no reason to hide from us. Talk to us. Or can you only communicate by threatening a child? I'm scared, Isabella. Who are you? I came to determine whether you are a threat to us, and to examine the purity of your energy sources. Energy? Is that why you're draining our shields? Yes. The emissions from your field generators are far richer than our normal sources of energy. Picard to bridge. Report. Shields at three percent. We're diverting all power. Acknowledged. If it's energy you want, we can provide it. You needn't destroy us. You should be destroyed. You are cruel, uncaring creatures. What makes you say that? The way you treat Clara. How have we mistreated her? You wouldn't let her do what she wanted, go where she wanted. You mean where you wanted? What difference does it make? Those places were inappropriate, even dangerous. I wouldn't have let anything happen to her. We didn't know that. We didn't know if you were real. All we knew was that her imaginary friend was frightening her, threatening her. That was only after you told Clara not to be my friend. I understand. You are seeing this ship, all of us, from a unique perspective. From a child's point of view. It must seem terribly unfair and restrictive to you. As adults, we don't always stop to consider how what we say and do shapes the impressions of young people. But if you're judging us as a people by the way we treat our children, and there can be no better criterion, then you must understand how deeply we care for them. Our children don't understand what might be dangerous. Our rules are to keep them from harm, real or imagined, and that's part of the continuity of our human species. When Clara grows up, she will make rules for her children to protect them, as we protect her. Please don't hurt us. If you still want to be my best friend, I'd like that very much. Status, Number One. We're clear. Full warp capability in 20 minutes. Inform all sections, we will leave this area in one hour. Sir. Mr. La Forge, drive the warp engines to full power. Direct an energy beam out into the nebula. Aye, sir. I came to say I'm sorry I frightened you. That's OK. And I misled you. I wasn't really your Isabella. For a while you were. I never had a friend before. I'm sorry I have to go away. Do you think you'll ever come back? I hope so. So do l. "
S5E23,"Captain's log, star date 45854.2. The Enterprise is charting the six star systems of the Argolis Cluster, an area being considered for colonization. Very impressive. It's beautiful. But frightening at the same time. I am detecting a transmission from within the system. What sort of signal? It is self-repeating. Of unknown pattern. Where is it from? A small moon orbiting the fourth planet. Life signs? Indeterminate. I am attempting to screen out sensor interference. Readings are inconclusive, but the moon's atmosphere can support life. It could be a distress call. Helm, take us into transport range. Dr Crusher, transporter room two with a Medical team. Acknowledged. I'm reading one life form. Very weak signs. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Riker to Enterprise. Go ahead, Number One. We've found the wreckage of a craft. One survivor. It's a Borg. Male. Adolescent. He's badly hurt. Sir, there is no other Borg activity within sensor range. Prepare to return to the ship. We can't leave him here. He won't survive. The Captain understands that. I don't. The Borg collect their dead. He's not dead! At least not yet. The transmission was probably a homing signal. They may be on their way. Let me at least stabilize him. Give him a chance. Your concern is noted, Doctor. But any intervention would alert the Borg to our having been there. We've turned that corner already. Kill it now. Make it appear it died in the crash. Leave no evidence that we were ever here. Security measures must be taken before we beam it up. Thank you. Standing by. Notify Security to prepare a detention cell. Bridge to Engineering. La Forge. We're bringing up a Borg. We need to neutralize the homing signal. Prevent it from sending or receiving any transmissions. I'll set up a subspace damping field around the detention cell. Four more. None survived. Picard to Riker. Go ahead. We are transporting you to the detention cell. I need him in sickbay. The cell, Doctor. Your equipment will be brought to you there. Very well. Come. Is there anything you wanted to talk about? I don't think so, Counsellor. I would have thought having a Borg on the ship would stir some feelings. I'm quite recovered from my experience. Sometimes, even when a victim has dealt with his assault, there are residual effects of the event that linger. You were treated violently by the Borg. Kidnapped, assaulted, mutilated... Counsellor. I very much appreciate your concern for me, but it is quite misplaced. I have considered the implications of having a Borg on this ship. I have weighed the possible risks, and I am convinced we are doing the right thing. Now, I am quite comfortable in my decision. I see. Well, if at any point you want to talk more... I shall certainly avail myself of your help. Lower the force field. Captain, the Borg is still unconscious. He has massive internal injuries. His brain implants were damaged. I may have to remove them. The Borg will die if they're removed permanently. Their brains depend on the biochips. Perhaps Geordi can make new implants. They contain relatively straightforward programming. We have the files from your experience, Captain. I think I can manage it. Mr. La Forge. Do you know enough about Borg programming to alter the pathways to their root-command structure? I'm not sure, sir. Subroutines are complicated. I'd probably have to study the data- processing algorithms for the codes. If we could get to the root command, we could introduce an invasive programming-sequence via its biochips and return it to the hive. Borg are interconnected. It would act like a virus. Which would infect the entire collective. We could disable their network at a stroke. Infect it? You make it sound like a disease. Quite right, Doctor. If all goes well, a terminal one. If this works how I think it will, it'll only be a matter of months before total systems failure. Comments. A question. What exactly is total systems failure? The Borg are computer dependent. A systems failure will destroy them. We should be clear about that. We're discussing annihilating a race. Which normally would be unconscionable. But the Borg leave us no choice. I agree. We're at war. There's been no declaration. Not from us, but certainly from them. They attack us at every encounter. They declared war. We are to be assimilated. But even in war, there are rules. You don't kill civilians. There are no civilian Borg. They're a single collective being. No one Borg is more an individual than your arm or leg. How convenient. Your point, Doctor? When I look at my patient, I don't see a collective consciousness. I see a living, breathing boy who is hurt and needs help. We're talking about sending him back as a tool of destruction! It comes down to this. We face an enemy who want to destroy us and we have no hope of negotiating a peace. Unless that changes, we are justified in doing anything we can to survive. Security to Captain. Picard here. The Borg has regained consciousness. Acknowledged. We proceed with the plan. What's he doing? Looking for an access terminal so he can interface with the collective. He doesn't understand that the signal is cut off. He's emitting a homing signal and a subspace beacon, but our damping field is blocking both signals. He's alone. For the first time, he has to cope with his environment without the resources of the collective. He must be hungry. The Borg don't ingest food. Their implants can synthesize any organic molecules they require. What they need is energy. Arrange to feed it. Aye, sir. I'll have to adapt a power conduit and install it in there. If I didn't know better, I'd think he was scared. I don't like this sport. Last week when you scored two touches, you liked it. Today, you were dropping your foil. You kept letting me inside. But if I lift up, you lunge right underneath. Let's face it, you're much better at this than I am. I understand we have a guest on board. Yes. Is that wise? I'm not sure. I hope so. I thought I understood you, but I don't understand this. It was an errand of mercy. He was injured. Dr Crusher decided for humanitarian reasons to care for him. They're gonna come after us. You, of all people, know that. Shall we go again? Are you alright? You felt sorry for me. Look what it got you. I'll have to go in to connect the power conduit. I will follow the Commander. Reactivate the field once we're in. Good. Now stay that way. Commander! We are Borg. You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile. Just look around, pal. You're hardly in a position to make any demands. We must return to the collective. Who's we? We are Borg. Yeah, but there's only one of you. Do you have a name? A means of identification? Third of Five. There were five on your ship. Is that it? Just a number? Third of Five. It does kind of suit you. OK. This is for you. It regulates power flow to the frequency you're used to. This connection should fit that coupling on your arm. You're welcome. Let's get out of here. Lower the force field. He's hungry alright. Why do you do this? I'm just a nice guy at heart. Are you feeling better? You are not Borg. That's right. And I hope to stay that way. You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile. That's gratitude for you! I've rationed his portions of energy. I think he understands. When he cooperates he gets fed. If not... Like a rat in a cage. If I'm going to figure out his command pathways, I need to learn how he processes data. The only way I know how to do that is by perceptual tests. For that, I need his cooperation. So he can help with the destruction of his species. Doctor... I know. We're at war. I'm here to help, but I don't have to like it. I think we're ready to transport him. Any trouble, we can access the force field through that console. Are you ready? La Forge to transporter room three. We're ready here. We're standing by. Energize. Third of Five, this is Dr Crusher. Dr Crusher, this is Third of Five. Hello. What is a doctor? A doctor heals the sick and repairs the injured. The sick and injured are reabsorbed. Others take their place. That isn't what happened to you. When we found you, you were dying. I saved your life. Why? It's my duty to help those who are hurt. You give us food. Yeah. Is that your duty? Yeah, that's right. Dr Crusher has repaired a lot of the damage to your biochip implants. We want to run tests, make sure everything's working OK. Tests? I'd like to show you a few diagrams and ask you questions about them. You will be assimilated. Yes, but before that, could we ask you a few questions? We will answer. Terrific. Hang on just a second here, Third of Five. What is your designation? Designation? Third of Five. You mean our names. We don't have designations, we have names. I'm Beverly. This is Geordi. Do I have a name? Do you want one? A name... I'm Beverly, he's Geordi, and you... You. You... Wait a minute. That's it. Hugh. What do you think? You. No, not ""you"". Hugh. Hugh. OK. Now... I'm Beverly. I'm Geordi. We are Hugh. Imagine what this shape would look like turned inside out. Which one is it? This one. That's right. He's gotten every one. Eight out of eight. It blows the top off the spatial-acuity percentiles. It's the prosthetic eye. It seems to give him very complex visual information. Like some kind of holographic imaging system. That could be helpful. Hugh, I'd like to take a closer look at your eyepiece. Is that OK? Here. Thanks. When you are assimilated, you will have a similar device. Hugh, do you understand we don't want to be assimilated? Why do you resist us? Because we don't want to live the way you do. Here it is quiet. There are no other voices. Other voices? On a Borg ship, we live with the thoughts of the others in our minds. Thousands of voices with us always. I think what you are saying is that you're lonely. Here. When you have completed these tests, what will be done with us? We'll... We'll send you home. We will rejoin the collective? When I started creating this invasive program, I had no problem with it. The more I work with Hugh, the more... Hugh? Yeah. That's what we call him. You named the Borg? It was easier having something to call him. So now you have a Borg named Hugh. Right. And he's nothing like what I expected. How so? I don't know. It's... It's like he's just some kid who's far away from home. You are the second person to refer to that Borg as a sort of lost child. I'm having second thoughts about what we're doing. Programming him like some sort of walking bomb. Sending him back to destroy others. Let me tell you something. When that kid's big brothers come looking for him, they're not gonna stop till they find him. Then they're gonna come looking for us and they will destroy us. And they will not do any of the soul-searching that you are doing now. Why don't you talk to him? It might not be so clear cut then. Because I wouldn't have anything to say. Then why don't you just listen? That is what you do best, isn't it? What is it? We've picked up a vessel headed this way. Analysis. The vessel is travelling at warp 7.6. Mass, 2.5 million metric tons. Configuration, cubical. The Borg. Its dimensions indicate a scout ship like the one that crashed. The star's radiation will shield us from their sensors. We should remain undetected for now. How long do we have? At present speed, they will arrive in 31 hours, seven minutes. You don't look so tough. We are Borg. Aren't you gonna tell me you'll assimilate me? You wish to be assimilated? No, but that's what you things do, isn't it? ""Resistance is futile."" Resistance is futile. It isn't. My people resisted when the Borg came to assimilate us. Some of us survived. Resistance is not futile? No. But thanks to you, there are very few of us left. We're scattered throughout the galaxy. We don't even have a home any more. What you are saying is that you are lonely. What?! You have no others. You have no home. We are also lonely. What is Geordi doing? I'm studying the components in your prosthesis. Why? We're trying to learn more about you. Why? Because you're different than we are. Part of what we do is learn more about other species. We assimilate species. Then we know everything about them. Yeah. I know. Is that not easier? Maybe it is. It's just not what we do. Why? Alright. Think of it this way. Every time you talk about yourself you use the word ""we"". ""We want this. We want that."" You don't even know how to think of yourself as an individual. You don't say ""I want this"" or ""I am Hugh"". We are all separate individuals. I am Geordi. I chose what to do with my life. I make decisions for myself. For somebody like me, losing that individuality is worse than dying. When you sleep, there are no other voices in your mind? No. Are you ever lonely? Sometimes. But that's why we have friends. Friends? Sure. Someone you can talk to. Who will be with you when you're lonely. Someone who makes you feel better. Like Geordi. And Hugh. That's it. It looks harmless enough. We had to disguise it. The Borg can screen out program anomalies. How can a geometric form disable a computer system? The shape is a paradox. It cannot exist in real time or space. When Hugh imprints this on his biochips, he'll try to analyze it. He will be unsuccessful and will store the shape in his memory banks. It will be retained for further analysis. When the Borg download his memory, they'll try to analyze it. It is designed so that each step will spawn an anomalous solution. The anomalies will link together to form an endless, unsolvable puzzle. Quite original. How long before a total systems failure? Not until the shape undergoes several hundred cycles. When can you begin? In about 20 hours. Dr Crusher wants to monitor the new implants. Very well. Begin as soon as you're ready. Captain. I have to admit I've been having second thoughts about this plan. In what way? Well... I've been getting to know him. The Borg. I see. He's not what I expected, Captain. He's got feelings. He's homesick. I don't know. It doesn't seem right using him this way. Centuries ago when lab animals were used for experiments, scientists would become attached to the creatures. This would be a problem if the experiment involved killing them. I would suggest that you unattach yourself from the Borg, Mr. La Forge. Aye, sir. Guinan. Please come in. Are you sure? You look like you're preparing for a quiet evening. No, I'm delighted to see you. Can I get you a drink? No, thank you. I was thinking how you said the other day that my foil was dipping. That I should get some exercise and strengthen my arm. A strong forearm is certainly an advantage in fencing. And bartending. About the Borg. Aren't you the least bit surprised by him? Surprised? You know he has a name? La Forge gave it to him. His name is Hugh. And he's lonely. I don't know what made me go see him. La Forge said I should, but I said no. And suddenly there I was standing there, staring at him. I thought it was just curiosity. Just curious. I need to hear you say that you are sure you're doing the right thing. If you're here to persuade me not to use the program... No. I think I need you to persuade me. Two days ago, you were so upset the Borg was even on the ship that you tore my foil out of my hand. And now you're questioning whether it should be treated as the enemy? No. But when you talk to him, can you honestly say you don't have any doubt? I haven't talked to it. Why not? I saw no need. If you're gonna use this person... It's not a person, damn it, it's a Borg! If you are going to use this person to destroy his race, you should at least look him in the eye once before you do it. Because I am not sure he is still a Borg. Because it's been given a name doesn't mean it's not a Borg. Because it's young doesn't mean that it's innocent. It is what it is. And in spite of efforts to turn it into some kind of pet, I will not alter my plans. Fine. But if you don't talk to him at least once, you may find that decision a lot harder to live with than you realize. Worf to Capt Picard. Yes, Lieutenant. We are ready to transport. Proceed. Lieutenant, you may wait outside. Locutus. Yes. I am Locutus of Borg. Why are you here? This is a primitive culture. I am here to facilitate its incorporation. Identify yourself. Hugh. Identify yourself. We are Hugh. This is not a Borg identification. Third of Five. This culture will be assimilated. They do not wish it. Irrelevant. They will resist us. Resistance is futile. Resistance is not futile. Some have escaped. They will be found. It is inevitable. All will be assimilated. Must Geordi be assimilated? Yes. He does not wish it. He would rather die than be assimilated. Then he will die. No. Geordi must not die. Geordi is a friend. You will assist us to assimilate this vessel. You are Borg. You will assist us. I will not. What did you say? I will not assist you. ""I""? Geordi must not be assimilated. But you are Borg. No. I am Hugh. I think I deliberately avoided meeting the Borg because I didn't want anything to get in the way of our plan. But now that I have... He seems to be a fully realized individual. He's even accepted me as Picard, ship's Captain, and not as Locutus. You've reconsidered the plan? Yes. To use him in this manner, we'd be no better than the enemy that we seek to destroy. So, I want other options. We can return him to the crash site. Remove his memory of the Enterprise. But if we erase his memory, who he is or who he has become is destroyed. Isn't that the point? He'd be reassimilated. Does it seem right to help him become an individual and then take it away? Will the Borg destroy him if they find out what happened? I doubt it. More likely they'd wipe out his memory of those experiences. Then either way, his memory would have been erased. But perhaps, in that short time before they purge his memory,... ..the sense of individuality which he has gained with us might be transmitted through the entire Borg collective. Every Borg given the opportunity to experience the feeling of... ..of singularity. Perhaps that's the most pernicious program of all. The knowledge of self being spread throughout the collective. And that brief moment... ..might alter them forever. We leave his memory intact. I have a question. What if he doesn't want to go back? Hello, Hugh. Hello, Geordi. Hugh, a Borg rescue vessel is coming. It will be here within three hours. We can return you to the crash site. They will find you and take you home. Or if you wish, you can stay here with us. What I wish is irrelevant. It's not irrelevant, Hugh. It matters to us. No Borg leaves the collective. If they find I am missing, they will come for me. Well, we'll deal with that later. We must know what you want. You are many, I am one. What I want is not important. Don't you understand? We're giving you a choice. Choice? Yes, a choice. Do you want to go back with the Borg or stay with us? I could stay with you? We could grant you asylum, Hugh. Choose what I want? I would choose to stay with Geordi. But it is too dangerous. They will follow. Return me to the crash site. It is the only way. Hugh. Think about this. Are you sure? Yes. The Borg ship will enter orbit in one hour. You'll soon be headed home. We'll beam him down and wait in the star's chromosphere. The interference will hide us. Goodbye, Hugh. It was nice getting to know you. Goodbye, Beverly. You saved my life. Hugh, it's not too late to change your mind. I must return. Captain, I'd like to go down with him. In my experience, they'd ignore him. Do you agree? The Borg assimilate civilizations, not individuals. But they kidnapped you. They needed a liaison to communicate. They ignored our away teams, including yours, Doctor. You may accompany him. Goodbye. Captain, I do not want to forget that I am Hugh. Energize. We found you there, in the middle of that debris. Then that is where I will wait. We are now entering position. Radiation levels are rising. Increase power to the shields. Hold us here. Status of the Borg ship? Radiation is rendering our sensors inoperable. At last known course and speed, the Borg ship will enter the system in three minutes. Well, I guess this is it? So long, Hugh. Goodbye, Geordi. I will try to remember you. "
S5E24,"Time, Mr. Data? We will be in transporter range in three minutes 21 seconds. Finally established audio contact with the Romulans. Main power is failing. No way to stop the overload. Enterprise to Romulan vessel. We are en route to your position. Enterprise, what is your time of arrival? Repeat your last transmission. Sorry, Captain. They stopped. Picard to Riker. Riker here. Transport to the Romulan ship when in range. Aye, sir. No weapons. They are not under attack. This is not a bright idea. I beg your pardon? I didn't quite catch that. Nothing, sir. All thrusters shut down. Your information is unreliable. The AH is inoperative. Give me a hand here. We're from the Starship Enterprise. We received your distress call. The Enterprise? A failure in your engine core? Yes. We had a forced chamber explosion in the resonator coil. A strange set-up, but I'd say the graviton generator is depolarized. There's no way to fix it. It'll have to be replaced. Where are your replicators? Off line. Who's in charge? The Captain is dead. I am Science Officer Mirok. We'd like to take this for replication. Alright. Geordi, you and Ro. La Forge. Two people and one piece of equipment. Aye, sir. What the hell...? Engineering, more power to the energizing coil. Brossmer to Riker. I'm losing them. I have to abort. They should be returning to your coordinates. Chief, do you have them? They're not here. No, sir. Where are they? I can't locate their patterns. We've lost them, sir. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. I've done all I can, sir. I'm afraid they're gone. Mr. Data, begin a level-one diagnostic. All transporters off. Could they have materialized somewhere else? Negative. The sensors cannot locate them within transporter range. Counsellor? Riker to Enterprise. Go ahead. Captain, we're still looking at a core breach. I need replacement personnel. Mr. Data, continue the diagnostic at another time. Take a shuttle and two engineers to the Romulan ship. Mr. McDowell, have all ships and shuttle pilots standing by. Ensign. Lay in a course away from Romulan vessel. Engage warp one if you detect any sign it may explode. Pressure in the containment chamber is increasing. What do we do to stop overload? The conduits are damaged. I can't even access the computer. Commander? Emergency bulkheads have sealed off the rest of the ship. There is no way to gain access to the control centres. Survivors? Readings indicate at least 73 Romulans are still alive. 73? The pressure has jumped. I can't control the chamber. It's going to implode. Auto-eject the engine core. I'll have to do it manually. Mr. Worf, seal the chamber. Implosion will occur in one minute. Enterprise, we need to jettison the engine core. You'll need to extend the shields. Understood. We'll stand by for your signal. We must get the doors closed. Commander. Time? 30 seconds. I'm ready, Commander. Stay there. Eject the chamber on my order. Excuse me, sir. Implosion in five seconds. Now. Enterprise, extend shields. We're still here. Yes. We'll have a power survey in an hour. We'll have to supply them with life support and a new engine. Understood. Keep me informed. Picard out. I'll be in sickbay. Aye, sir. Ensign Ro to the bridge. This is Ensign Ro. I'm at... section 23 Baker, near sickbay. Sickbay. Excuse me, I need some help... Excuse me. Excuse me, I need some help... Excuse me! I need some help. We shouldn't make hasty decisions. The transporter could have beamed them somewhere. The Romulan ship, another deck here. We've checked all those possibilities. The initial findings seem to indicate that there was a radiation surge which disrupted the signal. They never re-materialized. We should check again. We've done everything we can. You're right. I just hate making out death certificates. Does Ensign Ro have any family? Captain! None that I know of. But I'll check with the liaison officer. I'm not dead. I'll have the reports in an hour. Captain, I don't know what's going on. Doctor. I'm right here. Damn it... We're ready. Riker to Enterprise. Begin power transfer. The power flow is consistent at 400 kolems. No fluctuations. The main power grid is on line. Picard to Riker. Riker here. Power transfer appears stable. Good. What about the engine replacement? Engineering is modifying a subspace resonator to act as a new core. It won't exceed warp two but it will get them home. Very good. Captain. The diagnostic of the transporter system shows an energy fluctuation. I need to check the scanner in transporter room three. By all means. Captain? I have a favour to ask. I considered Cmdr La Forge to be my best friend. I believe I should plan and conduct the memorial service. May I have your permission to do so? Permission granted. Make appropriate arrangements. Thank you, sir. Commander, the... The Romulans want a computer. We cannot give them such access. That is an unacceptable risk. What about a core from 40 years ago that they're already familiar with? That would be satisfactory. Check what the Enterprise has. Be sure your concerns are addressed before we install it. Aye, sir. Thank you. La Forge? Ro. Boy, am I glad to see you. And I'm really glad you can see me. It's like I'm here but I'm not here. No one can see me, either. I can't figure it out. One minute we were transporting from the Romulan vessel. The next, I wake up in the arboretum with a headache. Can you pass through things like bulkheads? Tables. People. Yeah. We're solid enough to each other. It's not what you expected. What do you mean? This. Death. What? We're dead, Geordi. Is that some kind of joke? Our patterns were lost in a transporter malfunction. We never re-materialized after leaving the ship. Wait a minute. What are you saying? We're some sort of spirits? Spirits, souls. My people used to call them borhyas. Whatever term you use, we're it. But... My uniform, my visor. Are you saying I'm some blind ghost with clothes? I don't know. I've never been dead before. We are not dead! According to Dr Crusher, we died in a transporter malfunction at 1430 hours. Geordi, I saw her make out the death certificates. We need to make peace with our former lives. That's what I was taught. We have to say goodbye to the people in our lives. No. You may be ready for the afterlife. I'm not. I don't see we have much choice. When I was growing up, I never gave much thought to borhyas. I figured it was superstition for children, but... Fine. You go make peace with yourself. I'm going to figure a way out of this. I didn't have any warning that something would go wrong. Suddenly, their patterns just weren't there. I believe the cause may be the explosion on the Romulan ship. Really? But that happened before we even arrived. In all likelihood, the explosion damaged their cloaking device, causing it to discharge chroniton particles. I detect a chroniton field here. A chroniton field? If the particles were produced on the Romulan ship, why are they here? The transporter beam. I suspect the transporter beam carried them. That may have caused the deaths. I will go to the Romulan ship to discover the source. Commander, are these chronitons dangerous? They pose no danger to humans. However, some of the ship's systems may be affected. When I return, I will eradicate them. La Forge to Ensign... Thanks for the ride. I'm here to say goodbye. There were experimental engine components lying around there. I'd say they were testing a new warp-drive design. That would explain why they're so far from Romulan space. To avoid Federation long-range scans. We should have a core for them at 1900 hours. Commander, there will be a memorial service at 2300 hours. Mr. Data is making arrangements. I'll be there. Me, too. In fact, I'll say a few words. You knew La Forge. Actually, I was thinking of Ensign Ro. Me? Coordinate with Mr. Data. Wait. What are you going to say? Captain... I don't believe this. I'm dead, you can't hear me and I'm still intimidated by you. I just... wanted to say thank you. For trusting in me when no one else would. Hey. There you are. Excuse me, Captain. Listen. Data's going to the Romulan ship. We need to go. Why? I think that what happened to us, the answers, are there. Why can't you just accept the fact...? If you're right, this doesn't make any difference. If I'm right, then we're still alive and I'm gonna need your help. Lieutenant. I am planning a memorial service for La Forge and Ro. I would like you to participate. What kind of service? Capt Picard asked for a ceremony that was appropriate. I have given a great deal of thought to what is appropriate. Shuttlecraft four is not yet clear of the Romulans. Hold position. It's weird, listening to them plan our funeral. I find it difficult to decide on a service. Any suggestions? Human custom is to conduct a solemn, dignified service, in which the dead are praised by their loved ones. Ensign Ro was Bajoran. Her beliefs should be reflected as well. Their death rituals are complicated. Please, not the Death Chant. The Bajoran Death Chant is two hours long. I am not certain that human or Bajoran rites are fitting. I have researched the customs of 5,000 cultures to no avail. Shuttlecraft four has cleared. Resume course. In almost all societies, it is traditional to say a ritual farewell to those you call friends. I never had a friend until Geordi. He spoke to me and treated me no differently from anyone else. He accepted me for what I am. And that, I have learned, is friendship. But how do I say goodbye? He seems almost human, doesn't he? I'm not the proper person to advise you. Why? I am happy for Cmdr La Forge. He has crossed over to that which is beyond. For a Klingon, this is a joyful time. A friend has died in the line of duty. He has earned a place among the honoured dead. It is not a time to mourn. Begin docking. Data, that's a nice sentiment, but premature. I don't plan on being commemorated before my time. I'm afraid I fail to see the point of this investigation. Chroniton emissions may have claimed the lives of our officers. A most regrettable event. Was your cloaking device damaged in the explosion? All of our systems were, including the cloaking device. That explains the chronitons I am detecting in here now. For your safety, it is important to eliminate those emissions. Our safety? There is no way to predict their interaction with the new core. I have never seen this. There is something that looks like a molecular phase inverter. What? It's supposed to change matter so it can pass through normal matter and energy. Hang on a second. A few years back, the Klingons tried to combine a phase inverter and a cloaking device. In theory, a phased ship could hide anywhere, even inside a planet. Conventional weapons would be useless. How far did they get? It never got out of the preliminary stages. The Romulans might be pursuing that, trying to combine an inverter and a cloaking device. If this is the prototype... That explains the explosion. And us. You mean we're cloaked? Not just cloaked, phased. Our molecular structure altered so that we don't have any substance. Then that would mean we're not dead. It would also mean there's probably a way to de-phase us. The emissions are strong in this area. You can be assured the emissions will be eliminated. Commander, may I speak with you? If they come back, they'll find the generator. Is their transfer beam still at full intensity? It will be until we switch to internal power. We will set up a muon feedback wave inside the beam. Particles will accumulate in their dilithium chamber. When they go to warp speed, their engines will explode. We've got to warn them. How? I don't know. We have to find a way. The muon feedback wave isn't on any of the displays. The Romulans must be hiding it in a signal. Without a level-three diagnostic, they'd never detect it. There must be some way to warn them before they hit warp. This is puzzling. Three more chroniton fields have formed in the last hour. There's no reason why the interphase device would create new fields. We should begin decontamination. Run a sensor sweep of chroniton fields on the Enterprise. Aye, sir. These areas show contamination: sickbay, transporter room three, main bridge, Captain's ready room, shuttle bay two and engineering. Ro, look! I do not understand how these have formed. No transporter beam has been active in those areas. They have nothing in common. Yes, they do. They are appearing at random. No, we were in every one of those locations. We're leaving footprints. Can you narrow the scan to pinpoint locations? Not with the internal sensors. Go to science station two. Use a lateral array to get a precise reading. I will modify an anyon emitter to eliminate the fields. Why don't you go with her? I'll stay here with Data. Interesting. You're reading chroniton fields, but not from me? There's a field in this wall? Why? Data. I came through this wall. I walked through it when I came in. When the phased matter in my body passed through the wall, it disrupted the wall's structure, producing a chroniton field. Data, I'm right here. That's me you're reading. Watch. Come on. It's me. You see? Do not move. Yes. I can see you. Who are you? Where is the scientific officer? The one like us. The one who came with you to our ship. He spoke of a plan to return to normal. Yes, this disruptor works. I was wearing it when I was changed. Where is he? Data, stop being so rational. Try using your imagination once in a while. These aren't just random patterns. It's me. Watch where you point that. Wait, I think you did something. It's not so easy to push through. The molecules must have been partly de-phased by the anyon beam. Data, if a low-level beam can bring my hand partly back, maybe a high-level beam can bring me back. I'll just have to get you to turn up the intensity. Wait a minute, don't stop now. No, don't give up on it. It works. I was just creating more fields. Your method is fine. Just turn up the intensity, Data. He's in here. Brossmer to Cmdr Data. Data here. I've just detected a large chroniton field on deck 17. The field strength is 300 per cent above the others. Is that Ro? Acknowledged. Get up! Where is the science officer? I'll go. Commander? Ro! I'm detecting a chroniton field. May I scan the area? Certainly. Thanks. Any time. There's no indication of the muon wave in our dilithium chamber. It's there. When they go to warp... Incoming message from the Romulan ship. On screen. Now what? Installation of the new engine core is complete. We are ready to switch to internal power. Understood. Disconnect the power-transfer beam. We are now on internal power. Capt Picard, please accept my sincere thanks on behalf of the Romulan Empire. Don't listen to him, Captain. Our pleasure, Mirok. I hope this example of cooperation between our two peoples... ..will not be an isolated incident. As do l, Captain. Set a course for Garadius. Warp six. Don't, sir! Captain. I'm still running the decontamination program. Mr. Data believes we shouldn't engage warp until I've cleared all chroniton fields from the ship. Let me know when you finish. Sir. If we get to the locations she's decontaminating, maybe the anyon emissions would re-phase us enough. The beam would have to be pretty strong for us to be visible. Somebody has to look directly at us. Then let's go somewhere with a lot of people. It's time, sir. We should go. You have the bridge, Mr. McDowell. I'll be at the service in ten-forward. Well, that's perfect. We'll create chroniton fields and get them to flood that room with a stronger beam. Deck ten. I've been thinking about the first time I met Geordi. He was a young officer piloting me on an inspection tour. And I made some offhand remark about the shuttle's engine efficiency not being what it should. The next morning, I found that he'd stayed up all night, re-fitting the fusion initiators. I knew then I wanted him on my next command. Have you decided what to say about Ensign Ro? Yes, I have. It wasn't easy. Situations like these... What wasn't easy? What? What is going on here? It's our memorial service. This? Why not? I don't believe this. They think we're dead and have a party. Yeah. It's perfect. Come on, let's get started. This is... unusual. Yeah. I think I like it. Now I'll never know what you were gonna say about me. Do you think the others will find this service appropriate? Look around you. Everybody is sharing their memories of Geordi and Ro, laughing. What could be more appropriate? I am glad you approve. Brossmer to Data. Go ahead, Chief. Sorry to disturb you. We've cleared the critical areas but we've detected a new, strong field forming in ten-forward. Should I wait until the service is over? No, anyon emissions are harmless. Begin now. Aye, sir. Here we go. Worf, can you see us? We're right here. Damn. We have to find a way to increase the emission strength. If she hadn't lost her rank in that incident at Garon IV, she'd be Lieutenant Commander by now. Bridge to Picard. Go ahead. Incoming message from Garadius IV. The situation is deteriorating. They want our ETA. Stand by, Ensign. Excuse me. We have to do something before they go into warp. The disruptor, I'll put it on overload. Do it. Let's go. I would like to go soon. I see no reason to delay. The chroniton fields have cleared. Excellent. Mr. McDowell, set a course for Garadius. Cmdr Data, field strength has increased by 3,000 percent. Curious. Captain, we should decontaminate this room before getting under way. Very well. Chief. Increase anyon emissions to 6,000 particles per second. Decontaminate this area. OK, hang on. Data, do you see us? We're here. Right here. Did you see that, Mr. Data? Yes, sir. Come on, Data, put it all together. These were not ghosts. What did we see? I believe I may know, sir. Data, please be right. It would explain the mysterious chroniton fields. If they were cloaked in some way. You're saying that they're still alive? If I'm right, they are, and in this room. Their brief appearance coincided with the anyon sweep. Perhaps the anyons neutralized the cloaking effect. Chief Brossmer. Yes, Commander? Set the beam to its highest level. Flood ten-forward. Aye, sir. Data, do you see us? Of course. La Forge to Engineering. Take the warp engines off line. There's a muon wave inside the dilithium chamber. Captain, who gave that order? That was Cmdr La Forge. Please follow his instructions. Aye, sir. It looks like a great party. Can we join you? Geordi, it is good to see you. Thanks, Data. I've never been to a better funeral. Could you pass the rolls? You've been eating for an hour. Come on. We didn't eat for almost two days. I'm hungry. What's wrong? Nothing. Come on. I was raised with Bajoran beliefs. I even followed some of the practices. But I never really believed in a life after death. Then suddenly I was dead and there was this other life. And it made me feel arrogant to discount everything I'd been taught. Now I don't know what to believe. Well... We should develop our own interphase device. If it can teach Ro Laren humility, it can do anything. "
S5E25,"Captain's log, star date 45944.1. Following a magnetic-wave survey of the Parvenium system, we have detected an object which we cannot immediately identify. Magnify it. Mr. Data? It appears to be a probe. But there is no record of this design. Is it scanning us? No, but it is in a relative position and is holding course with us. It is made of paricium and talgonite, a ceramic alloy. Not a sophisticated technology. Sir, I detect a low-level nucleonic beam coming from the probe. Shields up. Stand by phasers. The beam is scanning the shield's perimeter. The probe is emitting a particle stream. It is penetrating our shields. Increase speed to... Captain! It's alright! Captain, I've got you. It's... Well, finally. How are you feeling? Kamin, can you answer me? What is this place? You're still feverish. Computer, freeze program. Computer, end program! Kamin. Picard to Enterprise! Kamin, please don't get up. You're still not well. I asked you, what is this place? This is your home, of course! Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Am I a prisoner here? You've had a high fever for three days. You mustn't push yourself too quickly. Kamin! You really shouldn't go outside! Kamin! Please, come back inside. Thank you. This sapling is planted as an affirmation of life, in defiance of the drought and with expectations of long life. Whatever comes, we will keep it alive as a symbol of our survival. Kamin! You're back on your feet. How do you feel? Are you in charge here? In charge? I want to be returned to my ship. What ship is that? Please. Just tell me, what is this place? Where am l? The fever. It's taken your memory. That must be it. Perhaps you can help me. Anything, my friend. My name is Kamin? Yes. And you are? Batai. Council Leader Batai. Batai. And you say I've been ill? For more than a week. Eline should have put you in the hospital, but she insisted on caring for you. Eline? Your wife. If you don't remember that, maybe it's safer not to go home! And... what is this place? Perhaps you should see the doctor. No, please. I'm sure it will all come back to me. Well, this... is the community of Ressik. Northern Province. What planet? Let me take you home. No, really, I'm quite alright. Just answer me. What planet? This is the planet Kataan. Kataan. Not a Federation planet. I... think I'll... just take a walk. But you've been ill for a week! The exercise will do me good. I'll... try to reacquaint myself with the surroundings. Thank goodness! I've had people out trying to find you. Why did you worry us like that? Are you hungry? Hungry, thirsty,... exhausted. I suppose that proves this is not a dream, doesn't it? You think that this... your life is a dream? This is not my life! I know that much. I've kept something hot for you. Where did you go? I walked. For hours. And you're just out of bed! It's delicious. You always say that. Would you answer some questions, no matter how strange they seem? Of course. Are there other planets in this star system? Do you visit other systems? Alright. Do you have a communications system here? How do you send messages to other communities, other places? The usual way. By voice-transit conductor. Do you want to send a message? Yes. When can that be arranged? Tomorrow. Don't you want to ask about us? Of course. Anything you can tell me will be helpful. We... We... We're married? Three years ago. The happiest day of my life was the day we got married. And what do I do here in Ressik? You're the best iron weaver in the community. At least, I think so. You prefer playing the flute, of course. The flute? Yes. When did I learn to play this? I'm afraid you never did, dear, but you keep trying. I see what you mean. Well, thank you for the soup. Thank you for your help. Tomorrow, will you help me send a message? Of course. Now, will you come to bed? I'll sleep here. Kamin, please come with me. I've been sick. I'll be tossing and turning. It wouldn't be fair to you. Let me be the judge of that. Where did you get this? Kamin, this is the first gift you ever gave me. Riker to sickbay, the Captain's hurt. Pulse and blood pressure are normal. Hyperactive fibrogenic activity. This is odd. What is it? There's no evidence of injury. Vital signs are normal. But neurotransmitter production is off the scale. What's going on? This probe is doing something. Anything yet, Data? No, sir. The particle emission is unusual. I am unable to block it. We should destroy the probe. Phasers are ready. That's not wise, not until we know what it's doing. Agreed. Stand down phasers, Mr. Worf. In the meantime, take us out of range. Thrusters only, 100 kph, nice and easy. Aye, sir. Data? The probe is moving with us, holding relative position. It's connected itself to him, like a tether. You've been dreaming about your starship again, haven't you? I'm just charting the progress of the course of the sun. It might give a clue to the cause of this drought. I think you're still trying to figure out where you are. Where that ship of yours is. How to get back to that life. The memory is five years old now. But it's still inside me. Was your life there so much better than this? So much more gratifying, so much more fulfilling, that you cling to it with such stubbornness? Eline... It must have been extraordinary. But never in all the stories you've told me have you mentioned anyone who loved you as I do. It was real. It was as real as this is. And you can't expect me to forget a lifetime spent there. Yes, I can. I've been patient, Kamin. For five years, I've shared you with that other life. I've listened, I've tried to understand. And I have waited. When do I get you back? I know. It has been hard on you. When will you let go? When will you start living this life? When will we start a family? Kamin. Eline. Good morning. Good morning, Batai. Are you ready? The Administrator's here. Yes. Will you come along? No, thank you. You do very well on your own. She always was strong-minded, even as a child. It's not her fault. These past few years have been difficult for her. And for you, I think. There you are, Batai. Perhaps you can explain, when crops are dying all over, how this tree is flourishing? Well, this tree is our symbol. Our affirmation of life. Everyone gives part of their water rations to keep it alive. We've learned, Administrator, that hope is a powerful weapon against anything. Even drought. A good point. Perhaps I'll recommend a symbolic tree in each of my communities. What business have we today? We need help to increase the water supply. We think there are ways to reclaim some of our water. You're being a bit of an alarmist. True, we're in a drought, but water rationing has produced savings. If the weather doesn't change, we'll run out of water. Who is this? Kamin, sir. Kamin! Do I know you? No. I haven't spoken to you before. Kamin, I'm open to all the people of this town. I'm delighted to hear what you have to say. I suggest that we build atmospheric condensers which could extract water from the air. I don't mean to quash your very creative ideas, but building atmospheric condensers would be a monumental undertaking. We could not sustain such a project. Each community will be responsible for its own. It's a choice between watering our crops, and watching them die. Well, I'll be glad to pass along your idea. This kind of participatory government works for everyone. Be well, Batai. I shall see you next month. Good to meet you,... Kanan. Go carefully, Administrator. That went very well. I think he was impressed with you. But there'll be no atmospheric condensers. These things take time. But it will happen, I'm sure of it. Come and have supper tonight, old friend. I'll make some vegetable stew. Let's talk about building our own condenser. Kamin. Hearing you talk to the Administrator, I realize that, for the first time in years, you were speaking as though you were truly a member of the community. It was good to hear that again. You've been brooding behind that flute all evening. I'm not brooding. I'm immersed in my music. Music. I find that it helps me to think, but the real surprise is I enjoy it so much. No, the real surprise is you're actually improving! Batai. Yes, ma'am. Go home. Yes, ma'am. Goodnight, Kamin. Goodnight, my friend. Go carefully, Batai. Don't forget these! I won't put them away for you again. Yes, ma'am! I've done nothing but nag all day. I'm sorry. No, I'm the one who's sorry. Everything you said this morning was absolutely correct. I feel that I have given you so little and you have given me so much. No. You're a good man. A wonderful husband. I didn't mean... No, not such a wonderful husband. I spend my time charting the stars. I disappear for days at a time, exploring the countryside. My life is very much as it was. Old habits. You're gentle and kind. You never once raised your voice to me. I'd like your permission to build something. You've built your telescope, your laboratory. You don't need my permission. In this case, I do. What is it? A nursery. Really? Really? Unless, of course, you would prefer a porch. It would be easier to build. I could make a start right away. No. Any progress identifying the probe? Maybe. We've picked up residue on the probe's shell. It may be from the propulsion system. They used a solid propellant as fuel. A solid propellant? Crystalline emiristol. It produces a trail we can trace. We can send our own probe and trace it back to the origin. I'll get right on it. I have analyzed the nucleonic beam. It may be possible to reflect the particles back to the probe to disrupt the signal. Doctor? I don't know the risk of shutting down the beam. I won't let it keep drilling into him! If somebody gets stabbed, you don't just pull the knife out. It may do more harm than leaving it. The Captain is under attack. We must act. I'm inclined to agree. Doctor, monitor him closely. Mr. Data, prepare to disrupt the beam. We're going to try to cut this cord. Meribor! Meribor, this is your brother's ceremony. Don't fidget, now. We name this child for a dear friend who died a year ago. But now, his memory will live on in his namesake. We name you Batai, in his honour. And he's starting out in the warmth of friends. Thank you. Help yourselves to something to eat. Congratulations, Kamin. Thank you. It seems like only yesterday we had Meribor's naming ceremony. Go on! I remember. I was so nervous, I was afraid that I would drop her. Now look at the little lady. She's no lady! Tromping through the hills with you all day, digging up those soil samples you insist on collecting. She's her father's daughter. I always believed that I didn't need children to complete my life. Now I couldn't imagine life without them. Kamin, what is it? Get the doctor. Hurry! His respiratory system's in spasm. Pulse is irregular and weakening. I'm losing him. Somatophysical failure. 2cc delactovine! Data, get that beam back! Fluctuations in the isocortex. Synaptic responses failing. Begin full cardiac induction. Blood pressure is dropping rapidly. 70 over 20. Data, re-establish that beam! I am attempting to do so. Losing response. Cortical stimulators. Start at ten percent. The beam is fully restored, Doctor. Blood pressure up to 90 over 40 and rising. Isocortical functions stabilizing, vital signs approaching normal. Meribor. Happy day, Father. That's my hobby. Find your own! You're the one who taught me. Don't complain if you turned me into a scientist. What has the scientist been up to today? Analyzing soil samples. There isn't any anaerobic bacteria. The soil is dead. This isn't just a very long drought, is it? My log entries go back ten years. You have data preceding that for 15 years. You've reached the same conclusion. I haven't reached any conclusion. A good scientist doesn't function by conjecture. A good scientist functions by hypothesizing then proving or disproving that hypothesis. That's what I did. You should see more of that young man Dannick. You are changing the subject. I'm not. I'm just hypothesizing that he's in love with you. You've taught me to pursue the truth, no matter how painful it is. It's too late to back off now. This planet is dying. Perhaps I should have filled your head with trivia. Games and toys and clothes. I don't think you mean that. No, I don't. It just... It saddens me to see you... ..burdened with the knowledge of things you can't change. I think I should marry Dannick sooner rather than later, don't you? Seize the time, Meribor. Live now. Make now always the most precious time. Now will never come again. I love you, Father. His vital signs are holding. They've been stable since the beam was restored. Cmdr Riker. We've received telemetry from the probe we launched. Go ahead. We charted the alien probe's radiation trail. Can you extrapolate an origin? A star system in the Silarian Sector. Kataan. Never heard of it. Data? An unmapped system of six planets. Any of them inhabited? Not now. The star went nova. All life in this system was destroyed 1,000 years ago. I've put away your shoes for you again. Yes, thank you, dear. I've been looking through this thing on and off for over 30 years. And I still don't see what you and Meribor find so fascinating. Fine. Then maybe you'll sit down and have a rest like you should do. You treat me like some frail flower. People have surgery all the time. He loves playing. He's quite good at it, don't you think? He loves doing a lot of things. Last week, all he wanted to be was a botanist. Before that, a sculptor. I wish he would find some focus in his life. I think he has. Maybe you should talk to him. Batai! Father? Your mother thinks you have something to tell me. Yes. I was waiting for the right moment, but that will never come. I'm leaving school. Leaving school? No, you're not! I want to concentrate on my music. That's what I care about. Last year, it was mathematics. Before that, botany... Through it all, there was my music. I think you know that, Father. This is the life I want. Well, we'll... We'll discuss it. Thank you, Father. Even after all these years, you still have the ability to surprise me. If music is what he wants, why should I stand in his way? Anyway, who knows how much time he'll have to follow any dream? Are you still planning to talk to the Administrator tomorrow? There's a possibility he'll dismiss me from the Council. Unless you keep quiet. No. The evidence is too pronounced. I can't stay silent. What a surprise... Kamin, what do you hope to accomplish? Spreading rumours that the planet is doomed. There could be chaos. The facts are here! Show them to someone who understands. I won't be a party to your making trouble! If you won't take them, I will! Your observations, your findings... Our scientists reached those conclusions two years ago. What did you expect us to do? Make it public? Imagine the effect! But surely, technology must exist to save something of this world. Perhaps... some people could be evacuated. Evacuated where? Our technology is limited. We're just beginning to launch small missiles. A collection of genetic samples. Something! Anything! You cannot let this civilization die! Enough! There is a plan in work. I can't tell you more than that. Father! What is it? It's Mother. Hurry! Doctor? Kamin, I'm sorry. See? I go to any lengths to get your attention. You always did have a flair for the dramatic! Doctor, thank you. Batai. Leave us alone for a moment. I... I need to talk to my husband. Did you show the Administrator your evidence? I didn't have to. They already knew. So, he won't throw you off the Council? No. Good. Remember,... ..put your shoes away. I promise. Gotcha! Now I gotcha! Some children are certainly making a lot of noise in here! You shouldn't be outside so long. It's damaging. I'm wearing your skin protector. And you, young man? Do you wear your skin protector? You do? Good boy. Happy day. It's time to see the launching. What launching? What's he saying? They're sending up a missile. We are going to watch it. I'm not going anywhere! Come on, Kamie. Hurry up now. Let's go see the launching. It breaks my heart to look at him. Who? My grandson. It breaks my heart. He deserves a rich, full life and he's not going to get one. Please come, Father. Why didn't I hear about the launching? Did everyone know about this except me? I'll... I'll be alright sitting here. You go off with the others. Hold on to my grandson and watch the damn thing go up for all the good it'll do! What are they launching? You know about it, Father. You've already seen it. Seen it? What are you talking about? I haven't seen any missile. Yes, you have, old friend. Don't you remember? Batai! You saw it just before you came here. We hoped our probe would encounter someone in the future. Someone who could be a teacher. Someone who could tell the others about us. It's me! Isn't it? I'm the someone. I'm the one you find. That's what this launching is. A probe that finds me in the future. Yes, my love. Eline! The rest of us have been gone a thousand years. If you remember what we were, and how we lived, then we'll have found life again. Eline. Now we live in you. Tell them of us, my darling. Something's happening. The nucleonic beam has ceased. The probe has shut down. Cerebral functions are stabilizing. Mr. Worf, get that probe in bay two for examination. Yes, Commander. What...? Please, Captain, don't get up too quickly. Captain? This is the Enterprise. I'm Jean-Luc Picard. How long...? 20, 25 minutes. 25 minutes?! I want you in sickbay. I'd like to run a full diagnostic on you. Dr Crusher... Come! Hello, sir. Feeling better? Yes. Yes, thank you. Well, I find that I'm... I'm having to rediscover that this is really my home. We were able to open the probe and examine it. Whatever it was that locked on to you was self-terminating. It isn't functioning any longer. We found this inside. "
S5E26,"Captain's log, star date 45959.1. The Enterprise has been recalled to Sector 001 on a priority mission. Evidence has been discovered of extraterrestrials on Earth five centuries ago. Work crews installing seismic regulators found some artefacts. And they date back to the late 1 9th century? Yes. The bifocal visual aid is typical of the era. The weapon is a .45 calibre double-action cavalry pistol invented by Colt Firearms in 1 873. Here, look inside the watch. How are extraterrestrials related to these discoveries? There was a problem with the regulators. Something inside the cavern was interfering with them. It turned out to be the cavern itself. The rock face has been altered by exposure to triolic waves. Which you won't find on Earth in either the 1 9th or 24th century. Triolic waves? The by-product of an energy source, used by few species because it is harmful to living tissue. No one has been in or out of this cavern in centuries. So we are left with a 500-year-old mystery. I'm curious. There are greater experts on Earth to investigate your mystery. Why bring the Enterprise all the way home? As we continued our excavation, we found one other thing. We've tried to leave everything as we found it. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, star date 45960.2. We have transported the materials from the cavern back to the ship. I wish I could be as dispassionate about the implications as my second officer. Interesting. There is a 1 2-percent decomposition of bitanium in the neural links. That suggests the alloys... Data, how can you look inside that, analyze the decomposition, without... Emotion, sir? Yes. I am simply being objective. Is this yours? I believe so. Could it be Lore? No, sir. My brother's positronic brain has a type-L phase-discriminating amplifier. Mine is a type R. Type R? Yes, sir. Can you tell how long this has been in the cavern? Decomposition indicates life ended approximately 500 years ago. That is consistent with the other artefacts. Your head is not an artefact! In relative terms, no. Nevertheless, it seems my life is to end in the 1 9th century. Not if we can help it. It cannot be prevented, sir. At some future date I will be sent back to 1 9th-century Earth, where I will die. It has occurred. It will occur. I can't tell you exactly who the aliens were, but I have found out a few things. The rock face tells us we're dealing with a species with microcentrum cell membranes. Triolic waves wouldn't harm them. They might be shape-shifters. They may have appeared as humans? It isn't anybody we've run into before. Nothing matches up with any known life forms. What does match is a cellular fossil which might have hitched a ride. A cellular fossil? A microscopic, ciliated life form. Not unlike a thousand other single-cell life forms. Except this particular one is LB1 0445. And LB1 0445 is only known to exist on one place. Devidia II, in the Marrab sector. Number One, lay in a course. On my way. So, do you want to talk about it? You refer to the foreknowledge of my death? Yeah. I have no particular desire to discuss the matter. Do you need to talk about it? Yeah! Why? Data, this has got to bother you a little. On the contrary. I find it rather comforting. Comforting? I have often wondered about my own mortality as I see others age. Until now it was possible I would live an unlimited period of time. Although some might find this attractive, to me it only reinforces the fact that I am artificial. I never knew how tough this was for you. Tough? As in difficult? Knowing that you would outlive all your friends. I expected to make new friends. True. And then to outlive them as well. Now that you know you might not? It provides a sense of completion to my future. In a way, I am not that different from anyone else. I can now look forward to death. I never thought of it that way. One might also conclude, it brings me one step closer to being human. I am mortal. Picard to bridge officers. Approaching the Devidia System. Report to your stations. See you later. Let's get together for a game of chess or something. That sounded like a very intense talk. Yeah. They found Data's head a mile beneath San Francisco. Been down there about five centuries. That's why the Enterprise has been sent back to Earth. I didn't realize. It's something, isn't it? He seems fine about it. Better than I am. Well, I'd better get to Engineering. Full circle. I heard about Data. Yeah. It's having an unusually traumatic effect on everyone. Yeah. If you don't want to talk, it's OK. I'm fine! Just... Angry. I'm not angry. Yeah, I'm angry. Why should I be angry? Because it reminds us of our own mortality. I just don't want to believe it. Have you heard Data define friendship? No. How did he put it? ""As I experience sensory input patterns, my mental pathways become used to them."" ""The inputs are anticipated and even missed when absent."" So what's the point? He's used to us, and we to him. It's like finding out a loved one has a terminal illness... Data! Counsellor. Commander. Would either of you mind if I made a personal inquiry? A personal inquiry? No, go right ahead. I perceive an apparent change in the way others behave toward me. For example, people abruptly end conversations when I appear, as you did when the turbo lift doors opened. Is that an accurate observation? Not at all. Yes. Yes. You're right, Data. And it's not a very nice thing to do. It's just that our mental pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. I understand. I am also fond of you, Commander. And you as well, Counsellor. We're in orbit. Any sign of life? Negative, sir. Captain. Sensors are picking up an unusual temporal disturbance on the planet's surface. 42 degrees, seven minutes north by 88 degrees, declination east. Temporal disturbance? Standard orbit at those coordinates. Spectral analysis shows a high level of triolic waves. Any correlation with the readings from Earth? Affirmative, sir. The magnetic signature is identical. Are the waves dangerous for humanoids? Only with long-term exposure, sir. Take an away team. Worf, Geordi, Troi. Join me in transporter room three. Commander. Mr. Data. I need you to monitor the sensor readings during this investigation. Captain, may I speak to you alone? Sir, it is standard for the second officer to accompany the away team. Yes, yes, Mr. Data. I am aware of that. Your decision is related to the discovery... I think it is reasonable to take precautions. There is no rational justification for this course. Then I'll be irrational! It is possible that my death will not occur for years. Even centuries. I hope that's true. However, this investigation began with your death. I'm trying to see it doesn't end that way. I appreciate your concern. But, to employ an aphorism, one cannot cheat fate. Cheat fate? Perhaps we can't, Mr. Data. But at least we can give it a try. The concentration of triolic waves falls off about here. It increases the closer in we go. What's the source? Something underground? Negative. What's the explanation? I don't have one yet. La Forge to Enterprise. Run a spectral-field correlation. Let's see if these readings are related to the temporal distortions. Acknowledged. Deanna? There's life here. A child. An old woman. Dozens more, hundreds. Terrified. Terrified? My God, Will, they're human. Troi's convinced they're human. They may be trapped somehow. We're not sure. The results of my temporal analysis may be pertinent. Go ahead. It indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic waves. That explains a few things. How much, Data? A positive displacement of .004 percent. Well, whatever or whoever is there, we're out of phase with it, by only a fraction of a second. That would make them invisible? A millisecond, a year, it makes no difference. If what we're reading is true, we're occupying the same space, but in a different time. How do we compensate? We can manipulate the distortion. Maybe. If we were to create a contained subspace force field. But to get a .004 variance, we need a very sensitive phase discriminator. We don't have one that comes close. Yes, we do. It is built into my positronic decompiler. It will be necessary for me to join the away team, sir. Proceed, Mr. Data. Mr. Data. Sir. Let me give you a hand with that. Once the force field is adjusted, I will no longer be visible. However, you will still be able to hear me. If you will help me test the comm system? My voice will go out on a delay correlated to the phase adjustment. That should allow me to maintain verbal contact. Will we be able to talk to you? No, sir. That will not be possible. The subspace field is established. You're set to go, Data. Adjusting the synchronic distortion. .001 . .002. .003. .004. I have made visual contact. There are life forms here. They are either unaware of me or choosing to ignore me. I am moving 10 meters north to observe more closely. They range from two to three meters in height. Silver-grey in colour. They have four limbs. No eyes or ears are noticeable. There is a single orifice where a humanoid forehead would be. They are reclined against the rock, surrounding some sort of apparatus approximately 1.5 meters in height. It is releasing what appear to be energy fragments, which are ingested by the entities. Perhaps some sort of nourishment. The upper portion of the apparatus seems to hold the energy segments. There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of these fragments inside. I have resumed the northerly course. There is no evidence yet of humans. OK, that's enough, Data. Come on back now. I have encountered another life form, an ophidian. It seems to be restricted by a force field. Two of the silver-grey entities are approaching it. They have released the force field. I am reading a temporal distortion of massive proportions. The ophidian... is time&space continuum. ..caught in... I am attempting... Data! Over here. Cmdr Riker, report. We've lost him. Excuse me. Pardon me. I'm searching for two individuals with an ophidian. A snake. Frenchman! Could you help out a forty-niner? I fell down a shaft. I got blown up in a tunnel. That is unfortunate. Most unfortunate. I require large amounts of whiskey as a liniment. I am sorry, but I have no whiskey. I'll take a dime. I am sorry, but I have no form of legal tender. Well, we're in the same boat, huh? Well, this is my street. You'll have to find one of your own. I would be happy to do so, but I am in search of information. Stockbrokers are cheap as hell. Don't even bother to ask. Your best handout is from a young fella with his lady. You give him a chance to show her he's generous. Steer clear of sailors. Most likely you'll get a fist across your jaw for your trouble. Thank you, but I'm trying to find two individuals with a snake. A snake? You are an odd fella, aren't you? But just don't be too particular where you get your funds from. You need medical attention. I will get a doctor. No, no, it's too late for that. Could you help out a forty-niner? Thanks! Put it on Gentleman Jim. Knockout in the fifth. Sir. I need temporary lodging. Looks like the missus booted you out in the middle of the night. I understand your misperception. However, this is not sleepwear and I do not have a missus. Well... I am a Frenchman. Everybody's from somewhere. That doesn't matter here. It's sixpence a day, or $4 a week. I have no money. Now, that matters. But I can perform significant tasks, both mental and physical. Perhaps your hotel would offer me a job. Geez, I don't know. We're happy with the maid we've got. Cook's decent. Dishwasher's drunk all day, but he gets here on time. And there's me. I do everything else round here. Sorry. Lady Luck not with you tonight, Mr. Lane? Poor fella. Hasn't filled a straight in weeks. Poker? Fold. Me, too. Go to blazes! A poker face carved in marble. Excuse me, gentlemen. What in hell do you want? I would like to join the game. Pale face. I don't like Easterners. I am a Frenchman. Mes parents sont originaires du Bourgonais. Je suis né á la New Orléans. Alors, nous sommes presque fréres. Je suis heureux de vous connaitre. Please, sir. The game is poker. The deal is yours. The ante is four bits. Family heirloom? In a manner of speaking. It is a crystalline composite of silicon, beryllium, carbon 70 and... Gold. Gold. I'll give you $3 for it. I accept. Did you see their faces? I did all I could not to laugh. To whom are you referring? Frederick La Rouque and Joe Falling Hawk. Those guys are card sharks. Sure, they play easy at first not to scare off the marks, but you give them a little time, they'll bleed a man dry. Especially an out-of-towner like yourself. What caused your jocular reaction? What was it you found humorous? Don't you see? They had you pegged for a sap. Your clothes, the way you talk. It's like you were born yesterday. You sure fooled them. I did not intend to deceive. Well, have it your way. This is the place. Breakfast is six to eight. Check-out's at noon. Thank you. It has been a pleasure. It would be advisable to monitor that cough. I have read that there is currently a cholera epidemic. Never felt better. Of course. The gratuity. Thank you for your assistance. A dollar?! If there's anything you need... It can get lonely in San Francisco. You might want some company. I can introduce you to Lilian. I have no need for companionship. But I do require some supplies. Anything you need. I can get it wholesale. I can get it for less than wholesale if you don't ask where it came from. What do you need all this stuff for? I am an inventor. No kidding! Well, this stuff's gonna take a while. I'll have to go clear across town. And it won't be cheap. Will this be enough? More than enough. You may retain the surplus for yourself. Keep the change? Exactly. Done! Help out a forty-niner. Fell down a shaft. Forty-niner. Help me. Help me out. No. No! Captain's log, supplemental. Close-range sensor analysis has yielded no further trace of Data. Despite repercussions among my crew, I must move this mission forward. I can't accept he's dead and leave it at that. We cannot make Data a priority. What is more important than Data? Look at what we have so far. Evidence that these aliens have been travelling in time to Earth. What if they're trying to undermine our history? Some kind of guerrilla war? We must assume that there is a threat, if not to us, then to 1 9th-century Earth, and determine what it may be. Mr. La Forge, we need a way to communicate with the life forms. It's not going to be easy to reproduce what Data did. We can create a subspace field, but we need a very sensitive phase discriminator to get .004 variance. Can you build one? It won't be as good as Data's. Will it be good enough? I can try. It'll take some time. I don't want anyone else going in alone. I can create a large enough subspace field to encompass everyone. But adjusting the phase inside it, that'll be the hard part. Make it so. We have to assume one thing, sir. Wherever Data may be, he's also trying to get to the bottom of this. He may have a better idea of what's going on, so it's in our interest to find him. Perhaps in the course of this investigation, we will. I hope so. If we find Cmdr Data, it may be our fate to die with him in the past. If our remains are in that cavern, they would have turned to dust long ago. I'm afraid to interrupt. Captain, you didn't have to come all the way down here. I'd have been happy to come up to you. And miss all this? I haven't seen such a complex operation since the Academy lab final in exochemistry. It's a Tzartak aperitif. It's very, very touchy. You have to change the evaporation point of the main ingredient. The temperature where it goes to vapour must be half a degree below the body temperature of the customer. When the liquid touches the tongue, it evaporates and the flavour is carried entirely by the vapour. A few molecules off, the vapour point crashes and puff! It's all gone. What is it you wanted to see me about? I hear you're sending an away team down to the surface. Are you going? It is rather unusual for you to be curious about an away mission. Maybe it's an unusual away mission. If you have something to say, I'm listening. Starfleet captains don't usually accompany away teams. It's general policy. This time, you have to. Why? You just do. Do you remember the first time we met? Of course. Don't be so sure. I just mean, if you don't go on this mission,... ..we'll never meet. Sorry it took so long, Mr. Data. Apology is not necessary. Are you alright? I believe I overexerted myself. Yeah, I'll say! Did you get it working? Yes. Whatever it is. This is for your trouble. What are you gonna do with the anvil? I require a low-intensity magnetic-field core. The iron mass of the anvil will provide that. What's it gonna be when it's finished? What do you think it is ""gonna be""? If I were to guess, maybe a new kind of motor for a horseless carriage. That is a good guess. Hot damn! You think there's money in them? Perhaps. Isn't that what makes America great? To what are you referring? A man rides into town in pyjamas, wins a grub stake at a poker table, turns it into a horseless carriage and makes a million. That's America! I have given you an erroneous impression. You know, someday my ship's gonna come in. You have a ship? Yeah. It's full of gold. I'm just biding my time till it gets here. Raising a stake any way I can. I've been a newsie, cut fish at a cannery. I've even been an oyster pirate. Quite a spectrum of occupations. You can't stay in one place too long. I'm always looking for the angle. Say, maybe we could go into business. Selling your horseless carriage. You invent 'em, I sell 'em. I can sell anybody anything. What do you say? Your plan is a bit premature. Keep it in mind, though. I'd better get back. I forgot. I got you something at the bakery on Third. Thank you, Jack. No. It's on me, partner. The eminent scientist Alfred Russel Wallace has revived the theory that Earth is at the centre of the stellar universe. This distinguished natural... ..philosopher has reaffirmed our planet as the only habitable globe in the heavens. A world, furthermore, constructed for the sole benefit of man. He's got a lot of folks excited about the notion. My dear Mr. Clemens, why do I think you are not one of them? Your suspicions, Madam Guinan, are undoubtedly based upon your keen observational skills. Now, if you'll permit me, I'll continue my character assassination unimpeded. My dear Mr. Clemens, please do. According to our best geologic estimate, the Earth is approximately 1 00 million years of age, perhaps a bit less, perhaps more. Perhaps a great deal more. Indeed. But regardless, it is ancient in the extreme. Now, geology also tells us that man himself has existed but for a microscopic fraction of those years. Yes. Curious, isn't it, that the world got by for such a great long while with no humans around to fill up space? I suppose Mr. Wallace and his supporters would say that the Earth needed all that time to prepare itself for our illustrious arrival. Why, the oyster alone probably required 1 5 million years to get it to come out just right. But if the Earth is not alone and there are millions of inhabited planets in the heavens... Quite my point. Man becomes a trivial creation, does he not? Lost in the vastness of the cosmic prairie, adrift on the deep ocean of time. A single one amongst countless others. Some may argue that a diamond is still a diamond even if it is one amongst millions. It still shines as brightly. Someone might say that, dear lady, if someone thought that the human race was akin to a precious jewel. But this increasingly hypothetical someone... ..would not be me. Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon. I would like to speak to Guinan. And you are...? Data. Mr. Data. Could it be under another name? No. I can't find your name on the guest list. I am a personal friend. Madam Guinan has found many friends since the newspaper announcement, but if your name is not on the list, there's nothing I can do. It is urgent that I see her. Sir... Unless you leave immediately, I will send for the police. That is an excellent idea. I will wait for them in there. Sir, please, you can't go in there! Guinan! Excuse me. I must speak to you. Forgive me. He barged in. I am sorry for the disruption. He would not believe we were friends. Do I know you, Mr. ...? Data. Yes. We were on a ship together. Well, I do so much travelling. What ship would that be? The Enterprise. Is that a clipper ship? It is a starship. Starship? What registry is that? Of course! Mr. Data. Excuse us. We have so much to catch up on. How are you? What exactly are you? Android. Artificial life form. Did my father send you? If he did, go back and tell him... I was not sent by your father. Circumstances demand I take you into my confidence. I require your assistance. Sorry. I am from the 24th century, where you and I serve on a starship. And? We encountered a species threatening 1 9th-century Earth. I was inadvertently pulled into their temporal vortex. When I saw your photograph in the newspaper, I assumed you had joined me from the future. From the Enterprise. I knew you were long-lived, but I did not realize you had visited Earth so long ago. Eavesdropping is by no means a proper activity for a gentleman. Nonetheless, the deed is done. Captain's log, star date 45965.3. An away team has beamed down with a device that may enable them to phase-shift into the alien world. OK, Counsellor, right over there. The triolic waves end right here. Mr. Worf? Sir! How soon will you be ready? We're ready now, Captain. Subspace field established. I'd prefer you to monitor us from the bridge, Captain. I have reason to believe my presence is imperative. Imperative? Yes. Mr. Worf, report back to the bridge. Sir, as chief of security, my place is at your side. The security of the Enterprise is of paramount importance. Yes, sir. Worf to Enterprise. Go ahead, sir. Beam me up. Proceed, Mr. La Forge. This tricorder can interface with the subspace generator. It should allow me to control the phase discrimination, if this is going to work at all. I need everyone inside the field. Adjusting synchronic distortion. .001 . .002. .003. .004. If we can see them, why can't they see us? We might not be far enough into their perceptual range. These strands appear to be biomagnetic. Variable flux. Possibly organic in origin. A life form. No. There's no life here. What I have sensed is more like an imprint. An echo of the last moment of life. Human life. They all died in terror. Oh, my God! They're delivering more of them for the others to ingest. Look at what he's carrying. "
S6E01,"Last time on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". They found Data's head a mile beneath San Francisco. Been down there about five centuries. At some future date, I will be taken back to 19th-century Earth, where I will die. It has occurred. It will occur. Do I know you, Mr... Data. Yes. We were on a ship together. The Enterprise. Is that a clipper ship? It is a starship. Starship? My God. They're delivering more of them for the others to ingest. Did my father send you? If he did, go back and tell him... I was not sent by him. We encountered a species who is threatening 19th-century Earth. I can't accept that he's dead and just leave it. We cannot make Data a priority. What is more important than Data? Remember the first time we met? Of course. Don't be so sure. If you don't go on this mission, we'll never meet. And now, the conclusion. I've long been interested in the notion of time travellers. In fact, I wrote a book about it. It tells the tale of a man of our era who fouls the 6th century by introducing newfangled gadgets and weapons, all in the name of progress. This idea of time travel... Not so far-fetched as it might seem. In fact, I have just learned that even now there are people from the future right here in San Francisco, and I have no doubt that their intent is to foul our world just like my Yankee did in King Arthur's time. Well, let me serve notice, as soon as I have the necessary evidence, I intend to expose them and make it absolutely clear that they are not welcome here. Yes, sir. Will this be a sequel to Connecticut Yankee, Mr. Twain? Name is Clemens, boy. Sam Clemens. That's with an E. With an E. Got it. Excuse me. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. The coroner said this is where they kept the cholera victims. It doesn't make sense that so many people are dying of cholera. It just isn't that virulent. Will. This is strange. What is it? The cerebellum, the cerebral cortex, the brain stem, the entire nervous system has been depleted of electrochemical energy. Here's another one. Same neural depletion. These people did not die of cholera. Their neural energy was drained somehow. Drained? And taken to Devidia II for those aliens to ingest? If you were a time traveller with a taste for human neural energy, where would you get your supply? I would travel back to a time when there were plagues and epidemics, so I could murder and use the disease as a cover. Over half the victims came from the Sisters of Hope Infirmary. The hospital near the waterfront. If the aliens killed people there, someone may have noticed something. They must have taken on human form. But how do we know who to look for? The tricorder indicated triolic activity from most of the bodies. If the aliens left that signature, they'll be detectable. We might even be able to rig some kind of alien-alarm system. Any luck contacting Data? None. The tricorder's broadcasting on all frequencies he might pick up, but the range is limited. Almost anything could interfere. She's back. Mr. Picard? Yes, Mrs. Carmichael? Mr. Picard! I'll be reminding you that it's one o'clock. Yes. One o'clock on a Thursday. I'm sure I made it clear to you that the rent is always due, payable in full, by one o'clock on Wednesdays. Yes. The rent. Mrs. Carmichael, even now my... my troupe are in rehearsals for a new production. I haven't heard of a new production. What play is it? The play? A Midsummer Night's Dream. We have performed in London, Paris, Milan... Milan! To sold-out houses. I can assure you, you will have the rent, in full, with a bonus. No, no. I've heard you silver-tongued devils before. I'll have my rent in full tomorrow by one o'clock, or you'll be performing on the street! I wouldn't do this for just anyone. I hope you won't spread it around I let you in. People start talking. Of course not, Jack. I assure you, Mr. Data would be upset if you didn't. If I can't find that letter of intent that he left me, our major investor is going to pull out and take his business elsewhere. It has to do with Mr. Data's engine? Engine? Yes. Yes. Yes, this is exactly what it's all about. Mr. Clemens, I'm gonna do you another favour today. You're always looking for good stories, right? I've got a real humdinger for you. The story of my life. You may think I'm young, but I've covered a lot of ground and it'd make pretty fascinating reading. So, what do you think? About what? About writing my life story. You and me. Literary partners, of course. Young man, I have a maxim that I have always lived by. No one is more qualified to write your story than you are. Me? Be a writer? Do you think I could do that? As long as it's about what you know. You got any passions? Any dreams? Well, I'd like to do some travelling, maybe go to sea. And I've had the strangest notion to go see Alaska. That's a great idea! Exactly what I would do if I were your age. Alaska, the Klondike, the aurora borealis. That's it! Follow your dreams and write about 'em. Thank you, Mr. Clemens. That is exactly what I'll do. You do that. You'll see my name in print. I'm sure I will. Don't forget. The name's London. Jack London. Goodbye now. Bye-bye. I found the head surveyor, I found the cavern. You will not be able to get to it. The entrance is on a mine shaft, in the Presidio, on an army base. Perhaps you could get us in. How? With permission to dig for the mine shaft. I've done all you've asked... I have full confidence in your persuasive abilities. Well, it's more interesting than throwing a tea dance. Strange. The transceiver assembly has been removed. Without it, I will be unable to track the time shifts. Twain. Clemens? Yes. He's been driving me crazy. He watches the house. He follows me down the street asking me questions. If anyone took this, you can believe it was him. If so, he must be warned. The device has been modified. Prolonged contact with human tissue would be toxic. Madam Guinan. Mr. Data. Shame on you, Mr. Clemens! Shame, madam? I think not. I find no shame in my efforts to uncover your plot! I keep telling you, there is no plot! Yes, you do keep telling me that. What an interesting pair you are. Where in Switzerland did you say you were from, Mr. Data? I am French, sir, not Swiss. Yes, that's right. Now I remember. A Frenchman. With a talent for poker, from what I hear. You know, I was talking to a friend of mine, Ches Whitley. He says to say hello and wonders when you're coming back. I do not know a Mr. Whitley. No? He works in the county assayer's office. He said you've been in there claiming to be a geological engineer and wanting information about mining operations during the 1850s. You remember him now? I am unfamiliar with the name. I spoke to several people there. Yes, I know. And in the hall of records, and in the Geological Society, and in a little-known mineral shop in Chinatown. You do get around, don't you? As apparently you do, Mr. Clemens. Yes. But I must admit, you've got me mystified. This... contraption, for instance. It's very unusual. It looks quite futuristic. Tell me, might it have something to do with time shifts? In a sense. The time shift is a gearing system I have invented for the horseless carriage. Do not insult me! You have come here to this century and brought your infernal technology for God only knows what purpose, but it will be the people of this century who will suffer for it! My dear Mr. Clemens, I do think we've heard enough. Mr. Data's business is his own, and I will thank you to leave now. Pardon me, Madam Guinan, but it is my business, too. It is the business of all humanity, I believe, to stop both of you from whatever it is you are doing here. And that is what I intend to do! Just what are you doing with those lamps? Replacing the burners. City ordinance. Makes it safer in case of earthquake. There hasn't been an earthquake here in 30 years. Well, that takes care of this ward. Time to be moving on. Earthquakes...! Nurse! If you can handle things here, I have to meet the board of patrons. I'll try to manage. There, by that bed. I can see an after-image of triolic waves. They've been here recently, I'd say within the last 24 hours. A man died there last night. This man complained about a strange doctor and nurse who visited that patient. Perhaps they're still in the hospital. Here. This'll make you more comfortable. Do you need any help, Doctor? Dr Apollinaire felt he had entered the algid state. He was cyanotic, pulse unobservable. That's an interesting cane. Doctor! Stand aside. Let me in. People said there was gunfire in here. A little misunderstanding. I was clearing people out. I haven't seen you before. I was sent here this morning from downtown. I worked downtown for three years. I don't remember you. We'll be off. No, wait. I must ask you all to come down to the station for questioning. Including you. Where'd you get that? That's a gentleman's cane. I've never seen a cane like this. I'll have to confiscate it for evidence. I just want you to know that I have the utmost respect for the law. Let's go! Data! Boy, are we glad to see you! I suggest we postpone our greetings for now. Agreed. Get us out of here. Halt! If we tune a phaser to the frequency of triolic waves and lay down a field burst, it might respond. The ophidian the aliens were carrying! What the... Minute distortions in the space-time continuum. Like we saw on Devidia II. So small they lasted only a second. The aliens are able to concentrate the distortion and direct it to a specific time and place. Maybe they have something, a mechanism that focuses it. Any device like that would produce high levels of triolic waves. Like in the cavern where Data's head was. I have located that cavern. Mr. Picard! I know you're in there. Open the door! Mrs. Carmichael... ""How now, spirit! whither wander you?"" ""Over hill, over dale, Thorough bush, thorough brier."" Thank goodness you're here! We need someone for a part. You're just in time. Mr. Picard, I need to be talking to you. ""..would that he be gone."" ""I'll met by moonlight, proud Titania."" Now, Mrs. Carmichael. There. ""Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania."" ""What, jealous Oberon!"" ""Fairies, skip hence:"" ""I have forsworn his bed and company."" Well, I don't need to hear any more. That was truly unique. Really? I think we have found our Titania. Don't you agree? Well, I... I did do a church play when I was a lass. Well, there you are! We start rehearsals tomorrow. You're back. I have wonderful news. I've found a way to get onto the Presidio and into the mine shaft. It is alright. Do you know me? Very well. Do I know you? Not yet. But you will. Thanks for your help. Be sure to put in me spotting that phoney policeman. Yes, sir, I will. Hello, son! Mr. Clemens. What brings you here? Writer's curiosity. I heard that two people vanished into thin air in this infirmary. One of the patients said that, yes, sir, but the police deny it. I bet they do. They say a band of outlaws set off an explosion and escaped. Well, what did these outlaws look like? The carriage they escaped in was driven by an albino. Mr. Data. You know him? You bet I do. You say there were others with him? Yes. At least a dozen. His accomplices. They've come from the future. It's an invasion! An invasion from the future? Mr. Clemens! What can you tell me? Do you have any proof? When's your deadline? Five o'clock. I'll meet you at your paper at 4.30 with a story to make your career. Thanks! Take me to the Presidio, driver, and don't spare the whip! The triolic waves are as high as they were on Devidia II. No sign of a control mechanism. I'm not so sure. My visor is picking up crystalline fractures. These walls have undergone some kind of selective molecular polarization. In fact, this cavern was configured to focus the space-time distortion. Just like a lens. Captain, we think we might be onto something. The cavern itself seems to be acting as a focusing mechanism. I'll bet it's the same at their habitat on Devidia II. If we can destroy that site, it'd put an end to their time-travelling. We have the ophidian. I don't know that we can get back. The aliens use triolic energy as a power source. The energy our phasers generate might not be entirely compatible. We must try. An event I most certainly would enjoy witnessing! However, I will regretfully waive that opportunity for the privilege of taking you all in to the authorities. Mr. Clemens, it is imperative that we continue our mission. Mr. Data, I have listened to your stories, excuses and evasions. I will listen no longer! It is my moral duty to protect mankind from whatever devious plan you have in mind. Now, move along. I suspect that even time travellers are vulnerable to the Colt .45. Now, let's go. I made a young fellow a promise and I don't want to be late. Follow him. Is everyone alright? I think so. You?! Where are we? And when? It's the 24th century on Devidia Il, and you're not supposed to be here. I have as much right to be in your time as you had to be in mine! I wanted to see how you've conducted my future affairs. Your future affairs? The affairs of mankind. But the disappearance of Mark Twain, a most noted literary figure? Thank you. It's not meant to happen. I took advantage of an irresistible opportunity. Any good writer would. Bridge to away team, acknowledge. We're here, Mr. Worf. Stand by to transport five. Commander. Mr. Worf? Yes, Commander? Make that six to transport. Where are we now? This is the Starship Enterprise. I want a security escort for this man. Security? What for? Are you afraid I'll go around stealing things? A werewolf! It's a long story, Mr. Worf. Let's take Data's body to the lab. I'll reattach the head we have. That head is over 500 years old. But it's the best chance we've got. I want Mr. Clemens kept under escort at all times. Commander, perhaps I could handle that. I'd be happy to take Mr. Clemens to his quarters. Good idea. Will you accompany the Counsellor? Madam, I'd be delighted. So, this is a spaceship. You ever run into Halley's Comet? Gently. Don't sit up too quickly. Where'd everybody go? I hope they're all safely back on the Enterprise by now. But you're still here. You were hurt. I had to make sure you were OK. And so you stayed for that? I didn't want anything to happen to you. You're far too important to me. You know an awful lot about me. Believe me, in the future, the tables will be turned. So we become friends? It goes far beyond friendship. But I'll have to wait 500 years. And when we meet, I won't even be able to tell you about this. No, because for me, none of this will have happened yet. What's that? That's history fulfilling itself. History has to fulfil itself. Even Picard knew that. You were there in the cavern. You know what happened. What am I supposed to do? If I told you what happened in that cavern, it might affect any decision you'd make now. I can't do that. I won't. Not telling me may affect my decision. Did you think of that? We're talking about Jean-Luc Picard. I can't sit around and hope it all works out. I've got to do something! Any place that doesn't stock a good cigar doesn't rank high in my book. If you must have one, I'm sure we can replicate it for you. If you think that one of these imitations can take the place of a hand-wrapped Havana... I wouldn't know. Well, that's the problem here. All this technology only serves to take away life's simple pleasures. You don't even let a man open the door for a lady. I think what we've gained outweighs anything that might have been lost. Well, I'm not so impressed with this future. Huge starships and weapons that can no doubt destroy entire cities, and military conquest as a way of life? Is that what you see here? I know what you say, that this is a vessel of exploration and that your mission is to discover new worlds. That's what the Spanish said. Deck 36. And the Dutch and the Portuguese. It's what all conquerors say. I'm sure that's what you told that blue-skinned fellow I just saw before you brought him here to serve you. He's one of thousands of species that we've encountered. We live in a peaceful federation with most of them. The people you see are here by choice. So they're a privileged few who serve on these ships, living in luxury and wanting for nothing. But what about everybody else? What about the poor? You ignore them. Poverty was eliminated on Earth a long time ago and a lot of other things disappeared with it. Hopelessness, despair, cruelty. I come from a time when men achieve power and wealth by standing on the backs of the poor, where prejudice and intolerance are commonplace and power is an end unto itself. And you're telling me that isn't how it is any more? That's right. Well, maybe... ..it's worth giving up cigars for after all. Any luck? Not so far. His activating units won't initialize. I thought they would have been protected by his buffering program, but I guess 500 years is just too long a wait. My watch! That's it. Yeah. It was found in the cavern where Data's head was. I guess after 500 years that's not likely to work either. Mr. Data, I fear I have sadly misjudged you. As I have misjudged many things. Can you communicate? Yes. You're injured. Why have you interfered with us? You hunt us. You kill us. We cannot allow that. We need your energy. Perhaps we can find a substitute. No. There is none. We must continue. We know how you move back and forth through time. My crew have returned to the 24th century to destroy your transport site on Devidia II. Destroy it? Your weapons will only amplify the time distortion. You will annihilate your own world. I'm going back for Capt Picard. Mr. Worf, assemble an away team to accompany me. Doctor, what can you tell me about that ophidian? I've started tests. In a few hours... I can't give the alien more time. I haven't determined if our phaser energy can generate a stable field. The risk would be... I'll take that risk! Permission to speak frankly. Go ahead. Our priority is to stop the aliens from any more incursions to Earth. Any delay is unacceptable. If I can save Picard, I consider it very acceptable. The Captain would not! We should target torpedoes on the alien habitat and destroy it. Immediately. He's right, Will. Power up the photons, Mr. Worf. Alert me when they're ready. Computer, initialize the reload circuits. Reload circuits are initializing. OK. Data? This ought to do it. I don't get it. I don't understand why this isn't working. Computer, ... ..run me a diagnostic on the input polarisers. There is intermittent contact in the input polarisers. Intermittent? What?! An iron filing. How'd that get in there? I have set the photons to fire in staggered rounds, detonating in ten-second intervals. Very well, fire when ready. The sequence will be ready to initiate in one minute. Computer, run another diagnostic on the input polarisers. Polarizer circuits are functioning. Well, then, that ought to do it. OK, Data, come on now. Torpedoes. Phasing. Alien. I am processing a binary message entered into my static memory by Capt Picard. Geordi, are we planning to fire on the alien habitat? Yeah, but... It is imperative that we do not. I will explain later. La Forge to Riker. Hold your fire! The binary message left by the Captain is not entirely clear. He's concerned about the phase differential of our torpedoes, that firing them might produce catastrophic effects. So how can we destroy their habitat? If I am correct, we must modify our weapons so the force of the explosion is re-phased into their time continuum. We could alter the photons with phase discriminators. How long will it take? At least a couple of hours. Fine. I'll have time to go get him. Sir? I'm going back to get the Captain. Doctor? My analysis of the phasers suggests you'd be able to open the rift, but you couldn't transport more than one person. If I go back, only one can return? That's right. Then I have the perfect solution for you. I'm the one who should return to the 19th century and remain there so your captain can return here. There's a risk. We're not sure how stable the rift will be. There's risk in everything. The point is, it's the right choice! I've got more books to write, and your captain has a job to do here. Geordi, brief him on what he needs to know. Aye, sir. I'm glad I have a chance to thank you. For what, sir? For starting me out on the greatest adventure a man's ever had! And for helping a bitter old man to open his eyes and see that the future turned out pretty well after all. I'm thirsty. I'm going to get help. We have to get you out of here. No, don't. Don't go. They'll be back for you soon. No, you need help. This thing put me down in the middle of Market Street! Took forever to get here. Cmdr La Forge has just completed the reconfiguration of the torpedoes. If Clemens got back, the Captain should have been here by now. We have no way of knowing if Mr. Clemens was successful. Re-establish your firing pattern. We'll wait five more minutes. Aye, sir. There's no time for chitchat, sir. According to Mr. La Forge, who did get your message, by the way, a frequency setting of .047 on your phaser will correctly activate this creature. You have to get help. Guinan needs medical attention. I promise she will be attended to. And there is a bill at the boarding house. I'll settle it. Thank you. I wish time would have allowed me to know you better. You'll just have to read my books. What I am is pretty much there. I'll see you in 500 years, Picard. And I'll see you... in a few minutes. Commander, I am picking up massive triolic-wave activity on the surface. Is it the Captain? There are no human life signs. No sign of temporal distortion? No, sir. But triolic activity is increasing. The aliens. Mr. Worf, are the photons ready? Yes, sir. Fire. Torpedoes away, sir. Sir, I am detecting a temporal distortion on the surface. And human life signs. O'Brien, get him out! Have you got him? He has indeed. And believe me, it's good to be back. We have destroyed the target. There is no further triolic activity. Ensign, lay in a course for the nearest star base. Warp six. Captain's log, stardate 46001.3. Everyone who should be in the 19th century is safely there and those who should be in the 24th are here. Mr. Data has been restored to us, head and all, and Samuel Clemens will write the books he was to have written after our encounter. Now be careful, boys, don't jostle her too much. Don't worry, Madam Guinan, you're gonna be fine! (ENGLISH) "
S6E02,"Captain's log, stardate 46041.1. We have located the USS Yosemite, a science vessel sent to observe a remote plasma streamer. The ship has not been heard from in days. Magnify. The last report says they were observing at medium range. Maybe they went in, got more than they bargained for. Hail them. No response. Life signs? Scanners cannot penetrate the plasma streamer's distortion field. Can we tractor them out? No. Ionic interference is too heavy. I'll take a shuttle in. Too risky. You could be pulled in. Bridge to Engineering. Mr. La Forge, can we beam over? We can, but we might not get a lock to bring them back. If we bridged our transporter system to theirs we might cut through the ionic field. That's a good idea, Barclay. Captain, I think we can do it by bridging the transporters. Acknowledged. Meet Riker in transporter room three. Aye, sir. Barclay, I'll need a systems engineer. I'll ask Ensign Dern to join you. I meant you, Barclay. Shouldn't I stay here and set up the remote link? Dern can do that. Let's go. Status, Mr. O'Brien? I have to send you one at a time and transport will take longer. How much longer? Twice the normal time. You're in for a bumpy ride. What do you...? What exactly do you mean by a bumpy ride? There may be static. You'll feel some tingling, but don't worry. Let's do it. Mr. Worf. Engaging system interlock. Pattern buffers synchronized. Phase-transition coils at stand-by. Energizing. He's there. I'll go next. Engaging interlock. Buffers synched. Energizing. I'm ready. Engaging interlock. Buffers in synch. Wait a minute. An ionic fluctuation in the matter stream. No problem. OK. Energizing. Reg, you're up. Aye, sir. Engaging interlock. Buffers in synch. Phase coils are... Sorry. I can't do this. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Reg, you were faced with a difficult transport. Anyone would have been apprehensive. Tell that to Cmdr La Forge and the team. I'm sure they understand. As soon as you feel OK, join them. No. Reg, is there something you're not telling me? Actually... This is not the... This is not the first time I've been apprehensive. Every single time that I tried to do it, I had this certain feeling. I guess you could call it mortal terror. Why have you kept it a secret? Why? Because my career in Starfleet would be over. That's why. I doubt that. I've always avoided it. You wouldn't believe the hours I've logged in shuttlecraft. The idea of being deconstructed, molecule by molecule, it's more than I can stand. Even when I was a child, I always had a dreadful fear that if ever I was dematerialized, ... ..that I would never come back again whole. I know, it sounds crazy. It's not crazy at all. You are being taken apart molecule by molecule. You're not the first person to have anxiety about transporting. We can desensitize you to this type of fear. It's a slow and gradual process, but it works. It does? How? You might try a relaxation technique, like plexing. Plexing? Yes, it's a Betazoid method. The next time you feel nervous, you stimulate a neural pressure point, like this. There's a nerve cluster just behind the carotid artery. It stimulates the brain to release natural endorphins. Plexing. Sounds easy enough. Here. You know, I feel better already. I think I can do this. There's no need to rush. We talked about confronting fear. The best way out is through. You said that once. I suppose I did. I'm gonna beam over. I can do it! There's no sign of anyone. Maybe they abandoned ship. Unlikely. The escape pods are still on board. There was an explosion. What caused it? I've ruled out a core failure or systems overload. Blast analysis indicates the explosion originated here... ..in the transport chamber. How? The transporter is still functional. Could they have beamed aboard an explosive device? Cmdr Riker, could you come here? Excuse me. Lt Joshua Kelly. He was the ship's engineer. How did he die? He has burns over his body, but I don't think they were the cause. I'd like to take him back to do an autopsy. You're sure, sir? Sure. Please, proceed. Itll only take a minute. It should be smooth. Good. I know how you feel, sir. You're afraid of transporting, too? No. Arachnids. Sickening, crawly little things, don't you think? All those legs. Spiders never bothered me. A few years back, I was called in to reroute an emitter array on Zayra IV. The entire system was infested with Talarian hook spiders. Have you ever seen one? Their legs are half-a-metre long. I had a choice. Do I let the emitter blow itself to hell? Or do I crawl in the Jeffries tube with 20 hook spiders? What happened? It was the hardest thing I ever did. I got through it. After that I was never so afraid. Thanks. Energizing. Welcome aboard. You ready to work? Yes, sir. Good. Start downloading the ship's science logs over there. Four crew members unaccounted for. Did you get anything? I don't know how these fit in. They were around the transporter. They look like pieces of sample container. We'll take these back to the ship for analysis. Mr. Barclay. Glad you could join us. Me too, sir. The Ferengi claim two freighters were destroyed by Cardassians in your sector. Is there any evidence? I'm loathe to believe them about anything... ..but there was evidence of Cardassian weapons. If the Cardassians also attacked the Yosemite, it could indicate a large movement in this sector. I have an away team on board. The initial report indicates there was an explosion, but not if it was an attack. How soon until you know? A few hours. If it looks like Cardassians, I'll contact you. Very well. Bridge to Capt Picard. Go ahead, Mr. Data. The away team is returning to the Enterprise. Acknowledged. Have Cmdr Riker come to my ready room. Aye, sir. La Forge to transporter room three. Ready. Stand by, Commander. Barclay to Enterprise. One to beam back. Stand by, sir. See, sir? That wasn't so bad, was it? Mission logs, science and medical logs, all scrambled. Looks like the blast wiped out the ship's core memory. We could try to reconstitute the data stream. It's worth a try. Commander, has anything strange happened to you during transport? Like what? I don't know. Anything out of the ordinary. No, not really. This looks hopeless. We won't get anything from these logs. Maybe this broken container I found can tell us something. Let's get this thing back into one piece. I mean, have you ever seen anything? Where? During transport. Sometimes my visor picks up resonance patterns. It's actually kind of pretty. Why? I'm just wondering. What are you getting at? Did you see something? When I was returning to the Enterprise, ... ..I could've sworn I saw something in the stream. Something? In the phased matter round me. At first I thought it was some kind of energy discharge. But then it flew toward me and touched my arm. How could something be in there? Molecules flying apart, half-phased? I mean, it's impossible, isn't it? We better check it out. When we're done here, we'll run a full diagnostic, alright? Alright. The confinement-beam subsystems check out. So do the phase-transition coils. Pattern buffer is fine. Emitter pads, targeting scanners, they're all working fine. This system's clean. So is the science vessel's. There's a lot of energy in the beam. Maybe you saw a surge in the matter stream. Yeah. I'll scan the Heisenberg compensators. Chief, you've done enough. It's no problem. Give me a hand. You know, maybe ignorance really is bliss. Sir? If I knew less about these things, they wouldn't scare me. I remember the day in Dr Olafson's transporter-theory class, when he was talking about the body being converted into billions of kiloquads of data, zipping through subspace, and I realized there's no margin for error. One atom out of place... You never come back. It's amazing people aren't lost all the time. With all due respect, I've done this for 22 years and haven't lost anybody. Yes, but you realize if the imaging scanners are off even one thousandth of a percent... That's why each pad has four redundant scanners. If one fails, the others take over. How many accidents have there been in the last ten years? Two? Three? There are millions of people who transport safely every day. I've heard of problems. What about transporter psychosis? Transporter psychosis? There hasn't been a case in 50 years. Not since they perfected the multiplex pattern-buffers. Transporting really is the safest way to travel. I'd like a closer look at those burns. Take a tissue sample, please. Damage to the epidermis only. Initiate a circulatory probe. His heart's beating. Cardio-stimulator. Now. It's gone. Neuro-electrical activity in the cerebral cortex. Nothing. Now his respiratory system's active. What the hell is going on? Water, ten degrees Celsius. Computer, access Starfleet medical database. Tell me about... Describe the disorder transporter psychosis. Transporter psychosis was diagnosed in the year 2209 by researchers on Delinia II. No, stop. All I need is... What causes it? Neurochemical molecules break down during transport, affecting motor functions, autonomic systems and the brain's higher reasoning centres. What are the symptoms? Victims suffer from paranoid delusions, multi-infarct dementia, hallucinations... Hallucinations? What kind of hallucinations? Victims experience somatic, tactile and visual hallucinations, accompanied by psychogenic hysteria. Peripheral symptoms include sleeplessness, accelerated heart rate, diminished eyesight leading to acute myopia, painful spasms in the extremities,... ..and in most cases, dehydration. Computer. What is the treatment for transporter psychosis? There is no known treatment. The autopsy showed ionization in every one of Lt Kelly's systems. I think that caused the muscular contractions. From where did the ionization come? There's evidence of electrical burns on his body, as if he was exposed to ionized gas or high-energy plasma. Plasma? There's no way they could have been exposed. Unless it was from the streamer. Is there evidence of a breach? Could the plasma enter the ship? No. Data, what's the report on that broken sample container? The analysis of the fragments is not yet complete. Captain, if there's ionization in those fragments, it could mean they beamed aboard material from the streamer. If the plasma exploded, that would explain a few things. Let me know when the analysis is complete. From the look of these fractures, the explosion came from within. The container does show evidence of residual ionization. I believe you are correct. It was used to store plasma. So they were collecting samples from the streamer. They had the proper container. How could it have exploded? Perhaps we should recreate their experiment to see what happens when matter is beamed aboard in the same way. Good idea. We'll prepare a new container. I don't want to take any chances. Set up a containment field. Aye, sir. Are you alright, Lieutenant? I'm fine. Yes, thank you. Geordi, Lt Barclay appears inordinately preoccupied with his physiological condition. I have seen him check his pulse and vision several times over the last 20 minutes. Thanks, Data. Yes, sir? Are you OK? I'm just fine, sir. You look a little pale. I do? Look, Reg... It's been a long couple of days. Get some rest. We got everything under control here. I think I'll do that. Thank you. La Forge to Counsellor Troi. Go ahead. Counsellor, do you have a minute? Lt Barclay, I've been calling you. Why haven't you responded? What are you doing? Walking. So I see. Where to? Nowhere. I don't get to see these decks often. Stellar Cartography. I thought that was deck 11 . I was having trouble sleeping. I'm trying to wear myself out. A perfectly normal thing to be doing. Cmdr La Forge said you seemed nervous this morning. I'm always nervous. Everybody knows that. He also mentioned that you saw something in the transporter beam. I was wrong. They checked the transporter. I imagined it. You don't sound very convinced of that. Counsellor, I appreciate your concern in this matter. But I wish you wouldn't continue. I'm perfectly fine. Mr. Barclay, you're exhausted and highly agitated. I cannot allow a crew member to endanger himself or others. I'm not endangering anyone and I wish... I think it is in your interest to take a leave of absence. I'm temporarily relieving you of duty. Fine. Do what you have to do, Counsellor. Computer, more birds. End stress-reduction program. Water. Specify temperature. I don't care. Just give me water. Calm, calm. Stay calm. Alright, computer, let's try some music. Something soothing. Sir, couldn't this wait till the morning? No. Chief, I've been reviewing the transport logs. What are these energy variations that keep appearing? There was one when I transported. They're just... ionic fluctuations, a result of our interlock with the Yosemite. A fluctuation occurred while I was inside the matter stream. It's nothing to worry about, sir. I need you to transport me to the science ship and back again. And while I'm in the beam, can you recreate an ionic fluctuation? I guess so. But, sir, what for? Cmdr La Forge wants some tricorder readings. We can do that here. No! The sensors may not be sensitive enough. I'm giving you an order, Mr. O'Brien. Aye, sir. If you don't mind an observation, sir, ... ..you forgot your tricorder. Either there's something there or I'm crazy. I've got to know. You can understand that, can't you? Yes, sir, I can. Stand by, sir. Wake the senior staff. And then I saw it again just 20 minutes ago. It was the same, exact thing, just moving around in the transporter beam. Let me get this straight. You think it was alive? It... was dark and distorted and it had what looked like a mouth. A mouth? I don't see anything wrong. Why didn't you tell anybody about your arm? Well, I thought I was hallucinating, that I had... ..that it was transporter psychosis. But now I know it was real. I was the only one who experienced ionic fluctuations in the transport. Maybe that's why I saw it. Mr. Barclay, I'm told that you've been under considerable strain. Isn't it possible that you simply imagined...? I know what you're going to say. I've acted strange. But believe me, I would never have called you in here unless I was certain. Mr. La Forge, get Mr. O'Brien. Take that transporter system apart piece by piece if you have to. Mr. Worf, I want a level-three security alert. Aye. I'll run a microcellular scan of Mr. Barclay's arm. It takes time, but if there's a problem, I'll find it. Keep me apprised. Dismissed. I'm picking up minute levels of ionization from the tissue of his left arm. The patterns correspond exactly to those in Lt Kelly's body... and in the sample container. There's no question. You have been exposed to the plasma. So, something did happen in the transporter beam. You might've been exposed on the science ship. You did say something touched your arm during transport. That's exactly where the ionization is focused. Does this pose a threat to him? It might. I'll run a base-pair correlation for any sign of DNA breakdown. Cmdr La Forge and I were planning to recreate the explosion. That might give us some answers. Permission to continue? Granted. Tell Mr. O'Brien to take primary transporters off line. I don't want further contaminations. Make sure you take precautions. Aye, sir. I'd like you to wear this monitoring device. It will tell me if there's increased ionization. Yes, Doctor. Structural reinforcement is at 240 percent. Activating containment field. That should do it. We've locked on to the plasma. Beam aboard a sample. OK. What would they do first? Standard would be a resonance-frequency scan. That sounds like a good place to start. Initiating resonance sweep. Frequency range at three... Barclay, check the containment field. The field is at maximum but it is holding. My visor's picking up biomagnetic energy. Highly complex patterns. You know, I think these things are alive. Life forms? That is correct. They appear to be microbes that exist within the distortion field of the plasma. We didn't detect them until we ran the scan. Apparently, they didn't like it. They shattered the container. Which caused an explosion similar to the one on the science ship. When we linked up with their transporter, one or more of the microbes got into ours. We think they're caught in the buffer. It might explain what you saw. But what I saw was much bigger than a microbe. Normal spatial relationships are distorted in the matter stream, exaggerating your perceptions. Some of these microbes are also in your body. Inside me? They were in Lt Kelly's body, causing the contractions during the autopsy. The biofilter should have screened them out. The microbes exist simultaneously as matter and energy. The biofilter cannot distinguish them. If we held Barclay suspended in mid-transport at the point where matter loses molecular cohesion... The molecules would emit nucleonic particles. We may be able to derive a pattern the computer would recognize. Then the biofilters could screen the microbes. I think this'll work, Reg. You'd suspend me? I don't like the sound of this. We'd have to keep you in there. How long? 30, 40 seconds, tough to tell. I think it'd be safe. But if I'm in the matter stream too long...? Your pattern would degrade and your signal would be permanently lost. After 15 seconds, you might feel light-headed. Try to stay calm. It's important not to move around too much. Initializing the pattern buffer. Holding at stand-by. Ready, Reg? Energize. Molecular resolution at 60 percent. Engaging static mode. His pattern is locked and holding. Starting biofilter scan. Signal's holding. The imaging scanners haven't isolated the microbes. I'll increase molecular dispersion. His resolution's now 55 percent. I can hold him together. Commander, the resolution's 50 percent. Bring him back. I know, give me one more second. We need to increase phase-transition frequency. Aye, sir. The scanners are actuating. Got it. Pattern acquisition... positive. Programming biofilter. Don't worry, Reg, this won't hurt a bit. A 92 percent increase in mass. There's something in the beam with him. Security to transporter room three. Right away. I'm setting up a force field round the chamber. Drop the force field. There are more in the beam. Grab them and hold on. Understood. Follow me. Reg, what happened? When I saw that there was more than one, I thought the other crew were trying the same thing. We're infected with something. Lt Kelly tried to reprogram the biofilter. Looks like he pushed molecular dispersion past integrity point. Your patterns got caught. The residual energy must have amplified the charge in the buffer and stopped your patterns degrading. Captain's log, stardate 46043.6 The reprogrammed biofilter was effective in removing the alien microbes from all crew members. The microbes have been returned to the plasma streamer. Chief. Lieutenant. I'm glad you could make it. This is the first time we've spoken outside the transporter room. I've always avoided you. Why? You run the transporters that I hate. At least, I used to. So, what's in the box? I thought you might like to meet Christina. Christina, Lt Barclay. It's your pet spider. Lycosa tarantula. Don't worry, she won't bite. She's... very large. I found her on Titus IV. Almost stepped on her by accident. I'll get us a couple of drinks. Keep an eye on her. Sure. Chief! (ENGLISH) "
S6E03,"Captain's log, stardate 46071.6. We have been called to aid a transport ship attacked near Rekag-Seronia. Hostilities between two factions on that planet have intensified, threatening an important Federation shipping route. Captain, sensors have located the transport ship. Two Rekag battle cruisers are flanking it. Red alert. Shields up. Phasers on line. Torpedoes ready. Is the transport still under attack? The cruisers' weapons are powered up. The Rekag ships are heading out of range. They won't take us on. We're within visual range. On screen. Sensors indicate damage to the Dorian subspace emitter. Audio communication only. Open a channel, Mr. Worf. Aye, sir. This is Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise. Capt Talmadge of the Dorian. I'm glad you're here. We took shield damage from the Rekag ships, but we're intact. Do you have any injuries? Can we assist you in any way? No injuries. I'd like to transport two passengers to your ship. Of course. We're conveying a mediator to Seronia. He's the reason they fired on us. Captain, I'm losing you. Beam your passengers on board. See to their needs then escort them to my ready room. Yes, Captain. Cancel red alert. Mr. Worf, take the weapons off line. I'm Counsellor Deanna Troi. Ambassador Ves Alkar. And my mother, Sev Maylor. Counsellor, it's imperative that I speak to the Captain. You think he's attracted to you. But he isn't. You offer him nothing. She hasn't been well. Could she be taken to quarters? Of course. Chief. I'll take you to Capt Picard. Mother, go with her. Don't pursue him. I won't have it. I'll stop you. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. I am grateful for the Federation's offer to escort me. But if I arrive on Rekag-Seronia on board the Enterprise, the armed flagship of Starfleet, my mission as negotiator of peace will be compromised. There must be a Federation transport ship somewhere that could take me. With all due respect. Admiral, to put the Ambassador on another unarmed transport would invite a second assault. I believe the attack was an isolated incident, nothing more. Ambassador Alkar. The dispute has threatened Federation ships for many months. We are grateful that you undertook this mission and you have our support. Thank you, sir. However, we recognize that safety is an issue, not just yours, but the crew that escorts you. To send you on an unarmed transport puts everyone at risk. I think it best to proceed to Rekag-Seronia on the Enterprise. Then I have no choice. Once you get there, you can conduct negotiations as you see fit. Until then you'll be in good hands with Capt Picard. I understand, sir. Good luck and a successful journey. Picard to Riker. Yes, sir. Set a course for Seronia. Aye, sir. That is all for today. There will be another class tomorrow at 0700 hours. The skills are demanding. You're very disciplined. I believe in a strong connection between body and mind. You share the same convictions. Yes, I do, only sometimes my body has a problem conforming to my mind's wishes. I imagine that your self-discipline helps your work. I don't know about that. I think maybe my biggest asset is patience. I let everyone talk until they're exhausted and when I start, they're too tired to argue. You'll need all your patience in Seronia. I can't imagine how you'll get the sides talking. Neither can I. I won't know that until we get there. I tend to feel my way through a situation. Deck nine. If I were empathic like you, I'd have a real advantage. I thought Lumerians were empathic. Only with each other, not other species. So, I don't have any idea what you might be feeling just now. Curiosity. What I sense from you is very unusual. Calmness, serenity, tranquillity. You embody the qualities that you hope to draw out in others. Tell me, have you ever been involved in diplomatic negotiations? Several times with Capt Picard. There are instances when having an empath along is helpful. I'm sure. I could use some of that help. Would you come with me to Seronia? If the Captain authorizes it, of course. Good. I hope to see you again. You're late. Mother, I told you that I'd be gone for over an hour. You're late because of her. Have you mated with him yet? What? That's what you want. Mother. Please, come in. I can always tell. The ones with a certain look in their eye. I'd better go. I'll tell you this. If you do, you'll regret it for the rest of your life. Mother, come in, please. You should lie down. Come in. Hi. It's that time again. The dreaded crew-evaluation reports. Does it have to be today? It's not going to be any easier tomorrow. It might. What's wrong? I've just had a disturbing encounter with Alkar's mother. She frightens me. The feelings I sense from her are malevolent. They're out of proportion. They're evil. I know she's been sick. She's very old. She's probably senile. We could all end up that way. You're right. OK. Let's get through these and when we're done, I'm going to reward myself with two ice-cream sundaes. First, molecular biology. Lt Jeffrey Fratis. Worf to Cmdr Riker. Go ahead. Can you report to Ambassador Alkar's quarters? There is an emergency. We're on our way. 40cc inaprovaline. I'm sorry, Ambassador. She was ill. I never should have brought her along. She was 93. She'd lived a long life. I should be grateful for that. Alkar, is there anything I can do? Counsellor, there's a funeral meditation. Part of our rituals. As an empath, you're the only person who could perform it with me. I'll be glad to help. This meditation is one of our most sacred ceremonies. Hold the stone like this. Say after me. An end to grief. An end to grief. An end to pain. An end to pain. Strength comes from love. Strength comes from love. And courage from wisdom. And courage from wisdom. Thank you. Computer, today's appointment calendar. 0900 hours, counselling session with Ensign Janeway. 1000 hours, counselling session... Cancel them. Cancel everything till after lunch. Acknowledged. You wanted to see me? Yes, Captain. Sorry, but I'm a little concerned. I can't determine the cause of death. She was elderly. Alkar said she had been ill. But I found no evidence of any disease. I did find abnormally high levels of neurotransmitter residue in her cerebral cortex. What are you suggesting? I'd like to do an autopsy. I've spoken to Alkar and he informs me that custom forbids it. Could you speak with him? You suspect that her death poses a threat to the Enterprise? Well... No. Then we have no alternative but to concur with his wishes. Deanna. Hello. Come in, please. I thought you might like some company, if you're not too busy. Nothing that can't wait. Would you like something to drink? No. I'd like you to talk to me. About? About you. I don't know anything about you. And I'd like to. There's very little to know. I lead a very simple life. What kind of woman do you find attractive? Do you find me attractive? Extremely. And when you find someone attractive, what do you usually do? That depends on a lot of things. Is it really so complicated? It can be. Well, perhaps you over think things. Deanna. Yes? I'm sorry. If I led you to believe... You are very beautiful. But our relationship can't be like that. Deck four. Sir. Will... We were supposed to finish the evaluation reports. Of course. Come in. Sir. As you were. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. I was just leaving. If there's anything else I need, I know where to find you. Yes, ma'am. Are you bothered by his being here? Of course not. Good. It's none of your business. I know that. I believe we were with Lt Fratis and molecular biology. Why do I think you're upset? I don't know. Could we just continue with the evaluation? Will, remember who you're talking to. You are bothered, I can tell. Deanna, I'm sorry I intruded. When you're ready to work, give me a call. I will. Captain's log, stardate 46073.6. We have arrived without incident at Rekag-Seronia where two members of Alkar's delegation have been waiting. They have joined us to report on the situation in the capital city. Things have deteriorated. Rekag sympathizers in outlying districts have attacked towns. I understood there was a ceasefire. It was broken. A Rekag shuttle strayed into Seronian space and was destroyed by fighter craft. The Rekags retaliated. There's been fighting ever since. If they would just sit down... The Rekags won't go into Seronian territory for talks. The Seronians won't go to Rekag. In the meantime, they fight. Ambassador, it sounds so volatile. Perhaps a cooling-off period? These people need an end now. To delay a week, even a few days, could cost thousands of lives. Then I recommend that we ask both sides to meet in Darthen. Why Darthen? It is a coastal city that has been neutral throughout. Both Seronian and Rekag loyalists live there. It's a compromise. Contact their leaders. If they'll meet me in Darthen, I'll join them there tomorrow. I know it must be my imagination. But it seems as though Lt Pinder doesn't want me in his section. What makes you think that? He's so critical. I can't ever please him, and I try to make sure there's nothing he could find fault with. Give me an example. Well, yesterday, I ran routine diagnostics on the sensor pallets. They checked out, but Lt Pinder questioned me because I allowed a 0.023 variance. That's well within specifications. He goes out of his way to criticize me. Do you know why he might do that? No. That's why I'm here. Well, maybe he's just tired of hearing you complain. Pardon me? I know I'm certainly tired of it. How do you think it feels to listen to someone whine all the time? I didn't realize I was... This isn't Starfleet Academy. You're not going to be coddled. If you can't take it here, think about a transport ship. There's less pressure there. But I love the Enterprise. I don't want to be anywhere else. If you aren't up to it, you don't deserve to be here. Isn't that right? I guess so. You better take a hold of yourself or be prepared for transfer. I will, Counsellor. Thank you. Glad I could help. Yeah, here we go. Biofilter log on Sev Maylor. Geordi, could this log have been damaged? I don't think so. Why? There's a discrepancy between the log and the tricorder readings I took three days later. The tricorder shows massive physiological deterioration compared with when she beamed aboard. I can't believe that so much damage could have occurred in such a short time. I can run a diagnostic on the biofilter and your tricorder. Thanks. The best way to get information would be to do an autopsy. Ambassador. We've received word from the delegates. They'll meet you in Darthen tomorrow. Thank you, Commander. Counsellor Troi has altered her appearance. Am I interrupting? Hello, Counsellor. You want him, I can tell, but you have nothing to give him. Could I talk to you in private? You're envious of him! You pretend to support him but you want him to fail. That's not so. Please. Return to your quarters. I want to be with you. Ambassador, the Counsellor and I are needed on the bridge. Of course, Commander. I don't know what you were doing. You were way out of line. Deck nine. Alright, Deanna, just what the hell is all this? Anxiety. Do you still care about me? Of course I care about you. I'm worried about you. What's all this? Don't you think I'm attractive? This just isn't you. It is. You want me, don't you? Deanna. I need you. What is this? Please. Come in. Deanna, I'm leaving for the surface. You said you'd take me with you. I know. But that's not possible now. You said I'd be helpful. You needed me. I still do. You've done so much. Then take me. Don't leave me here. Is Liva going with you? She's been on Seronia for weeks. She knows the situation. She wants to take you away from me. Deanna, you are my anchor. I need you more than you realize. Do you understand? I need you here, making it possible for me to work. I won't let her have you! I'll stop her. I will go with you! Take me with you! Please, Alkar. Don't leave me! Don't do this! No! You wouldn't have recognized her. Her dress, her hair. Everything about her was... I'm closer to Deanna than I've ever been to anyone. Last night, she was someone that I had never seen before. You don't know what caused her to behave like that? No. I've thought about it. I don't have an answer. Computer? Location of Counsellor Troi. Deck six, corridor B. Let's go. Ambassador. I came to alert you that the Rekags and Seronians disagree about seating. I'm not surprised. The good news, however, is that the ceasefire is holding. And that is by far the best news. Thank you, Captain. Chief. Will you take me with you? Deanna! Deanna, I already told you... I won't let her have you. Security to transporter room two. Don't try and stop me! Let go! It's nothing. It's superficial. What happened to Deanna? All her systems have elevated readings. Take her to sickbay. I want to see you in sickbay, too. Captain, perhaps we should delay transporting. No. You should proceed with your mission. Very well. Chief. Transport them to the planet surface. We'll have to sedate her. 20cc melorazine. Yes, Doctor. How's it feeling? A little stiff, but it'll be fine. It'll disappear in a day. Dr Crusher. I think you should see these readings. Her neurotransmitter levels are 300 percent above normal. If you remember, I found extremely high levels of neurotransmitter residue in Alkar's mother. Has Deanna picked up a disease from her? I don't know. I need to do that autopsy. I don't care about the customs of Alkar's people. I need to find out if there's a connection between Maylor and Troi. Picard to Lt Worf. Worf here. Mr. Worf, contact Ambassador Alkar. I need to speak with him. Doctor, neural energy is now 340 percent above normal. Captain, Ambassador Alkar is in negotiation and cannot be disturbed. Proceed with the autopsy. Medical log, stardate 46075. 1. I have performed an autopsy on Alkar's mother. Instead of answering our questions, the results have created an even deeper mystery. I don't have any explanation for this. When I examined Maylor's body, her heart, her lungs, her skeleton, most of the systems in her body, were 30 years old. But how? We saw the woman. That's not all. I compared Maylor and Alkar's DNA. I don't know who that woman was, but she was not his mother. Deanna's condition is deteriorating rapidly. She could die. There are questions that only Alkar can answer. Picard to Lt Worf. Worf here. Meet me in transporter room two. We're going to the surface. Aye, sir. No, she wasn't my mother. She wasn't 93 years old. Captain, did you perform an autopsy against my wishes? Yes, for a very good reason. Counsellor Deanna Troi is in sickbay, dying. Dr Crusher doesn't know the cause. I believe you do. Alkar, we need you. The Rekags have withdrawn some of their concessions. The Seronians are threatening to break off talks. I'll be right there. But... They've been arguing for hours. It seems hopeless. But now, when expectations are lowest, now is the moment I can be most effective. If I'm focused, centred, free of disquieting thoughts, I can turn these factions toward peace. Alkar. Hear me out, Captain. It's important you understand. You see, I discovered long ago I had the ability to channel my darker thoughts, my unwanted emotions to others, leaving me unencumbered. Is this what you've been doing to Counsellor Troi? I hadn't planned it. I'd expected Maylor to live through the negotiation. Her death could not have been more untimely. So then, you deliberately used Deanna. She's an empath. I was certain I could establish a link with her. Frankly, I was amazed at how quickly she'd aged. Usually, my receptacles survive for years. Receptacles? Come, now, Captain. Surely you can see there's a broader canvas here. If I came to these peace talks hindered by unwanted emotions, the Rekags and Seronians would be condemned to fight. You cannot explain away a wantonly immoral act because you think that it is connected to some higher purpose. Captain, do you know how many have died on this planet in the last 48 hours? Thousands. Deanna Troi is just one individual. That does not justify brutalizing her, nor any others you have used. Ask the Seronian and Rekag children in fear of their lives. Captain, I get no payment. I have no power base, no agenda. I am willing to risk my life simply to help others. Do you think that makes you appear courageous? Because you're mistaken. You're a coward, Alkar. You exploit the innocent because you're unwilling to shoulder the burdens of unpleasant emotions. Well, this time, you will be held accountable. I'm taking you to the Enterprise to release Troi. I have no intention of releasing her ever. Alkar, everything is falling apart. You have to come now. If you'll excuse me, Captain. Mr. Worf. I'm needed. You and your security chief will leave. Lock on to Alkar's signal. I am sure the Seronians have reactivated their security field. Work with Mr. La Forge to break through it. Aye. I'll be in sickbay. If Alkar is flooding her with psychic waste, that explains the high level of neurotransmitters. All these negative emotions pouring into her have caused a chemical response. Can you counteract it? Enzymic decontaminants can reduce neurotransmitters. But I can't make any headway unless Alkar stops. He has no intention of stopping. He feels justified in using her until she dies. Then Deanna has to die. In order to save Deanna, Alkar has to break his link with her. The only way he'll do that is if she's no longer adequate. When Maylor died, Alkar turned immediately to Deanna. If Deanna dies, and he breaks the link with her, he will choose someone else, possibly from his delegation. You're talking about killing Deanna! I can resuscitate her if it's not more than 30 minutes. The question is, is that enough time? Alkar has to link with someone else before we revive Deanna, or else he might turn back to her. We must bear in mind that we'll be putting his next victim at risk. I want every security measure taken to protect that person. How will you? I'll give her a hypospray of dylamadon. It's the gentlest way. Proceed, Doctor. Well, my friend, the era of bloodshed and conflict appears to be over. What is it? I'm fine. Just a little light-headed. You're exhausted. Do you want a doctor? No, of course not. Enterprise to Ambassador Alkar. Respond, sir. I'm here, Captain. Ambassador. You must return to the Enterprise immediately. Troi is dying. We will transport you whether you come willingly or not. Security force fields are protecting us. They won't any longer. Transporter room two, prepare to energize. We're ready, Captain. Computer, make a note. Death occurred at 1430 hours from respiratory and renal failure. Wait for me in my quarters. Of course. It's tragic, but her death had a purpose. I'll make certain you answer for what you have done. Your own Federation Council promised me safe passage back to my planet. I expect you to honour that. How long do we have? Three minutes, 40 seconds. Transporter room two. Lock on to the woman in Alkar's quarters. We may have to transport her. Mr. Worf, station yourself outside her quarters. She helped me so much. Without her, I couldn't have accomplished what I did. I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do? Yes. There is something. If we could share the funeral meditation. We have a minute and a half. Prepare the cordrazine. We'll use that with the cortical stimulators. Yes, Doctor. We can't wait any longer. Release the stasis field. Doctor. 10cc cordrazine. Cortical stimulators. Now. An end... An end to pain. An end to pain. Again. She has a pulse. Blood pressure climbing. 90 over 40. Cortical activity approaching normal. Neutralize the neurotransmitters. Initiate decontamination sequence. Levels are dropping. Down to 420 percent above normal. 390 percent. Picard to transporter room three. Not yet. We won't know if it's working till the levels are below 300 percent. Alkar. Alkar, what's wrong? Neurotransmitter levels are down to 310 percent. 290 percent. Now. Transporter room three, energize. Let me go! Neurotransmitter levels are down to 230 percent. Worf to Capt Picard. Ambassador Alkar is dead. Will... Beverly thinks Alkar was at a susceptible point in the ceremony. He was vulnerable. Then the flow of negative emotions was reversed back to him somehow? That's our guess, like a man with no immune system. And Liva? She seems fine. He wasn't able to establish a link. Looking back on the past few days it's as though I'm looking at a holodeck projection of someone else. That's how it seemed to us. Thanks for sticking by me. I always will. Even when you're old and grey. (ENGLISH) "
S6E04,"Captain, I have identified the signal. It is from the USS Jenolen, a Federation transport ship reported missing 75 years ago. Code One Alpha Zero, ship in distress. Take us out of warp. All stop. Aye, sir. Report. We have entered a massive gravitational field. There are no stars or stellar bodies listed on our charts. However, sensors indicate a strong gravitational source here. Can you localize the source of the field? Sensors? I am having difficulty scanning it. It appears to be 200 million kilometers in diameter. That's as large as the Earth's orbit. Why didn't we detect this before? The object's enormous mass causes gravimetric interference. That might have prevented our sensors detecting it. Mr. Data. Could this be a Dyson Sphere? The object does fit the parameters of Dyson's theory. A Dyson Sphere? It's an old theory. I'm not surprised you haven't heard of it. In the 20th century, a physicist, Freeman Dyson, postulated the theory that an enormous hollow sphere could be constructed around a star. This would harness all the radiant energy of that star. Any population living on the interior would have virtually inexhaustible sources of power. Are you saying people live there? Possibly a great number of people. The interior surface of the sphere is the equivalent of more than 250 million Class-M planets. Sir, I have located the signal. It is coming from the northern hemisphere. Put us into synchronous orbit above that position. Aye, sir. I have located the Jenolen. It is impacted on the surface. Magnify. There are no life signs. There are small power emanations. Life support is still functioning on minimal levels. Riker to Engineering. Geordi, transporter room three. Mr. Worf. This air's pretty stale. Life support is barely operating. See if you can increase the oxygen level. Commander, the transporter is still on line. It's being fed power from the auxiliary systems. The rematerialisation subroutine has been disabled. That's not all. The phase inducers are connected to the emitter array. The override is completely gone. The pattern buffer is locked into a continuous cycle. This doesn't make any sense. Locking the unit into a diagnostic mode just sends matter array through the pattern buffer. There's a pattern in the buffer. It's completely intact. There's less than 0.003 percent signal degradation. How is that possible? I've never seen a transporter jury-rigged like this. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? I know a way to find out. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Thank you, lad. We've got to get Franklin out. Someone else is in there? Franklin. We went in together. Something's wrong. One of the inducers has failed. Boost the gain on the matter stream. Come on, Franklin. I know you're in there. It's no use. His pattern's degraded 53 percent. He's gone. I'm sorry. So am I. He was a good lad. I'm Cmdr Riker, Starship Enterprise. Lt Cmdr La Forge. The Enterprise. I should have known. I bet Jim Kirk himself hauled the old girl out of mothballs to look for me. Capt Montgomery Scott. Tell me, how long have I been missing? Well... Sir. I have restored life support. The oxygen levels will return to normal shortly. Capt Scott, Lt Worf. Lieutenant? Yes. Captain, there are things we should talk about. We should get you to sickbay. Dr Crusher... You've changed the resonator array. Geordi, our guest will have a lot of questions. Not to worry. I'll take care of him. What have you done with the duotronic enhancers? Those were replaced with isolinear chips 40 years ago. It's a lot more efficient. That's an EPS power tap. So you were on your way to the Norpin Colony when you experienced warp-engine failure? That's right. We had an overload in one of the plasma-transfer conduits. The Captain brought us out of warp. We hit gravimetric interference. There it was, as big as life. Is that a conduit interface? Yeah, it is. You were saying, as big as life. You mean the Dyson Sphere? Aye, an actual Dyson Sphere. Can you imagine the engineering skills needed to even design such a structure? It's amazing. What happened when you approached it? Well, we began our survey of the surface. We were just completing the initial orbital scan when our aft power coil suddenly exploded. The ship got caught in the sphere's gravity well and down we went. Franklin and I were the only ones to survive the crash. Can I ask a question? What made you think of using the transporter buffer to survive? Well, we didn't have enough supplies to wait for the rescue, so we had to think of something. But locking it into a diagnostic cycle so the pattern didn't degrade and cross-connecting it with the phase inducers to provide a power source, that's absolutely brilliant. I think it was only 50 percent brilliant. Franklin deserved better. I think you'll enjoy the 24th century. We've made incredible advances these last 80 years. From what I've seen, you've got a fine ship. A real beauty here. I must admit to being a bit overwhelmed. Wait till you see the holodeck. You have a hairline fracture of the humerus. It will ache for a few days, but it should be fine. Thank you. Well, I'll say this about your Enterprise, the doctors are a fair sight prettier. I'm Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome aboard, Capt Scott. Thank you, sir, and call me Scotty. How are you feeling? I don't know. How am I feeling? Other than a few bumps, you're fine for a man of 147. And I don't feel a day over 120. It must say, I was surprised you were on board the Jenolen. Our records didn't show you as crew. I was never crew. I was just a passenger. I was heading for Norpin V to settle down and enjoy my retirement. I see. I would enjoy hearing you talk about your career. I'm sure you would have fascinating insights into your time. I'd be happy to. Good. I look forward to it. We need to begin a full spectrograph analysis of the sphere. I'll get right on it. Good. Once again, welcome on board. I need to get to Engineering. Engineering! I thought you'd never ask! Captain, the first thing you need to get is rest. This has been a shock. Don't push yourself. We're pretty busy down there. I promise I'll give you a tour when it's OK. I'll find someone to show you your quarters. Aye. This is the food replicator and your computer terminal. Good Lord, man, where have you put me? These are standard guest quarters. I can try to find something bigger. Bigger? In my day, even an admiral wouldn't have had such quarters. I remember when we had to transport the Dohlman of Elas. You never heard anyone whine so much about quarters as she did. The holodecks, ten-forward and the gymnasium are at your disposal. The computer will tell you how to find them. Use these panels if you need anything. These quarters remind me of a hotel room on Argelius. Now, there is a planet. Everything a man wants right at his fingertips. Of course, on the first visit... Excuse me, I have to return to duty. Well, then... Thank you. Shut down the warp engines and recalibrate the aft sensors. Aye, sir. Can I help you, sir? I don't think so, lassie. I'll let you know if you can. Sir, this area is restricted. Bartel, it's OK. I'll handle it. Capt Scott... We're in Engineering. Call me Scotty. Scotty, this isn't the time for a tour. We're running a phase-seven survey of the sphere. I'm not here for a tour, laddie. I'm here to help. That's very kind but we can handle it. I was a Starfleet engineer for 52 years, Mr. La Forge. I think I'm still useful. You're right. We'd be grateful for your help. Good. Let's get to work. Sensors indicate a G-type star at the centre of the sphere. There is a Class-M atmosphere clinging to the interior surface. Any indication it is inhabited? Not as yet. Our preliminary data suggests it is capable of supporting life. We have been unable to find signs of current habitation. Mr. Data, send class-four probes to survey the far side of the sphere. Perhaps they'll have more luck. Aye, sir. Adjust the frequency of the main deflector... You need to phase-lock the warp fields within three percent. What? Look here. We use a multiphase-autocontainment field now. It's meant to operate above three percent. Well, that would make the difference. We can restart the engines in ten minutes. Thank you. I remember a time when the old Enterprise was spiralling towards Psi 2000. Thank you. The Captain wanted to try a cold start of the warp engines. I told him that without a phase lock, it would take 30 minutes. ""You cannot change the laws of physics,"" I told him. He wouldn't believe me. I came up with a whole new engine-start-up routine. Do you know your dilithium crystals are going to fracture? We recomposite the crystals while they're still inside the articulation frame. Look, I'd love to explain everything to you but the Captain wants this analysis done by 1300 hours. Do you mind a little advice? Starfleet captains are like children. They want everything right now and their way. But the secret is to give them only what they need. I said I'd have this done in an hour. How long will it really take? An hour. You didn't tell him how long it would really take? Of course I did. Laddie, if you want people to think of you as a miracle worker... Capt Scott! I've tried to be patient, I've tried to be polite. But I've got a job to do here. Frankly, you're in the way. I was driving starships while your great-grandfather was still in diapers. I'd think you'd be grateful for some help. I'll leave you to work, Mr. La Forge. May I help you, sir? Aye, lad. Scotch, neat. There you go, sir. Thank you. What in blazes is this? Didn't you order Scotch? Laddie, I was drinking Scotch 100 years before you were born. I can tell you, whatever this is, it is definitely not Scotch. I believe I may be of assistance. Capt Scott is unaware of synthehol. Synthehol? Yes, sir. It is an alcohol substitute served aboard starships. It simulates the appearance, taste and smell of alcohol, but the intoxicating effects can be easily dismissed. You're not quite human, are you? No, sir. I am an android. Lt Cmdr Data. Synthetic Scotch. Synthetic commanders. I believe Guinan does keep a supply of non-syntheholic products. Perhaps one of them would be to your liking. What is it? It is... It is... It is green. Please enter program. The android at the bar said you could show me my old ship. Let me see it. Insufficient data. Please specify parameters. The Enterprise. Show me the bridge of the Enterprise, you chattering piece of... There have been five Federation ships with that name. Please specify by registry number. NCC-1701 . No bloody A, B, C or D. Program complete. Enter when ready. Here's to you, lads. I hope I'm not interrupting. I was coming off duty. I wanted to see how you were doing. Not at all. Would you have a drink with me? Thank you. I don't know what it is exactly, but I would be careful. It's real... Aldebaran whiskey. Who do you think gave it to Guinan? Constitution class. Aye. Are you familiar with them? There's one in the Fleet museum. But then, of course, this is your Enterprise. I actually served on two. This was the first. She was also the first ship I ever served on as chief engineer. You know, I served aboard 11 ships. Freighters, cruisers, starships. But this is the only one I think of, the only one I miss. The first vessel that I served on as captain was called Stargazer. It was an overworked, underpowered vessel, always on the verge of flying apart. In every measurable sense, my Enterprise is far superior. But there are times when I would give almost anything to command the Stargazer again. It's like the first time you fall in love. You don't ever love a woman quite like that again. Well, to the Enterprise and the Stargazer. Old girlfriends we'll never meet again. What do you think of Enterprise D? She's a beauty with a good crew. But? But... When I was here, I could tell you the speed that we were travelling by the feel of the deck plates. But on your ship, I feel like I'm just in the way. 75 years is a long time. If you would care to study some technical schematics... I'm not 18. I can't start out like a raw cadet. No, there comes a time when a man finds that he can't fall in love again. He knows that it's time to stop. I don't belong on your ship. I belong on this one. This was my home. This is where I had a purpose. But it's not real. It's just a computer-generated fantasy. And I'm just an old man trying to hide in it. Computer, shut this bloody thing off. It's time I acted my age. Come. Mr. La Forge, I understand that before the Jenolen crashed, it had conducted a survey of the Dyson Sphere. Have we accessed those records? We tried to download their memory core, but it was damaged. We haven't got much out of it. Perhaps Capt Scott could be of use in accessing that material. It's possible. He knows those systems better than any of us. I'll have Lt Bartel beam down. Mr. La Forge. I would like you to accompany Capt Scott. Me? Yes. Look, this is not an order. It's a request and it's one that you must feel free to decline. One of the most important things in a person's life is to feel useful. Now, Mr. Scott is a Starfleet officer. I would like him to feel useful again. I'll go with him, sir. Thank you. Commander. I have found something which could be a communications device. There is an antenna array 400,000 kilometers south of our present position. It is emitting low-intensity subspace signals. Can you open a channel? Not from our present orbit. The array is directed away from us. Ensign, prepare to put us in orbit. Capt Picard, to the bridge. Are you feeling alright? Never get drunk unless you're willing to pay for it, the next day. I'll manage. OK. Energize. Sensors indicate that the large circle is a portal or airlock, possibly leading to the interior. Looks like the front door. Should we ring the bell? Mr. Worf, open a channel to that communications array. Aye, sir. A tractor beam has locked on to us. Get us out of here. We've lost main power. Auxiliary power down to 20 percent. We're being pulled inside. Auxiliary power failing. The frequency of the beam is incompatible with our systems. Warp- and impulse-engine relays have been overloaded. I am attempting to compensate. The tractor beams have released us. Hold until we get our bearing. Full sensor sweep. Where are we? 90,000,000 kilometers from the star's photosphere. I am reading surface instability. It may... Sir! The inertial from the tractor beams is still carrying us forward. Impulse engines are off line. I can't stop our momentum. We're falling directly into the star. The primary database should be on line now. Give it a try. OK. I've got three access lines to the central core. Still nothing. Bunch of old, useless garbage! I say it's old. It can't handle the interface of your converter. This equipment was designed for a different era. Now it's a piece of junk. I don't know. It's held together pretty well. A century out of date. It's just obsolete. You know, that's interesting. I think these systems haven't changed much in the last 75 years. This transporter is basically the same system we use on the Enterprise. Subspace radio and sensors still operate under the same basic principle. Impulse engines haven't changed much in 200 years. If it wasn't for the damage, it might be in service. Maybe so. But when they can build ships like your Enterprise, who'd pilot an old bucket like this? I don't know. If she were operational, I bet she'd run circles round the Enterprise at impulse speeds. Just because something's old, don't throw it away. We used to have something called a dynamic-mode converter. You wouldn't have something like that? I haven't seen anything like that in a long time. But I could come up with something similar. La Forge to Enterprise. La Forge to Enterprise, come in, please. Interference? No, they're gone. We will enter the photosphere in three minutes. Manoeuvring thrusters? 30 percent power. Not enough to stop us. No, but it may be enough to turn us into orbit and hold our distance. Port thrusters, ahead full. Starboard thrusters, back full. Our flight path is changing. Right 10.7 degrees. Insufficient to clear the photosphere. Lt Bartel, divert all power to the manoeuvring thrusters. Aye, sir. We're in orbit, Captain. Our altitude is 150,000 kilometers. I'll try to get main power back on line. Very well. Mr. Data, begin a scan of the interior surface for life forms. I want to know who brought us in here and why. Aye, sir. I can't find them in orbit. They could have crashed into the sphere. We'd pick up background radiation if they'd gone down. There's another possibility. They could be inside the sphere. Maybe. Whatever happened, we've got to find them. If we got the engines on line, we could track their impulse-ion trail. Are you daft? The main drive assembly is shot. The inducers have melted. The power couplings are wrecked. We'd need a week to get started. But we don't have a week. So, no sense in crying about it. We'll see what we can do with your power converter. The sphere appears to be abandoned. Sensors show that the star is extremely unstable. It is experiencing bursts of radiation and matter expulsions. That would explain why they abandoned it. But if no one is living there, how were we brought inside? I believe we triggered automatic piloting beams, designed to guide ships into the sphere. Sir, sensors show a large magnetic disturbance on the star. It is a solar flare. Magnitude 12, class-B. Shields? Shields are up, but only at 23 percent. There is increased activity. Sensors indicate solar flares will continue to grow. In three hours, our shields will no longer protect us, sir. Shunt the deuterium from the main cryopump to the auxiliary tank. The tank can't withstand that kind of pressure. Where did you get that idea? What do you mean, where did I get that idea? It's in the impulse-engine specifications. Regulation 42/15, pressure variances on the IRC-tank storage? Yeah. Forget it. I wrote it. A good engineer is always a wee bit conservative on paper. Just bypass the cut-off valve and boost the flow. It'll work. OK. If we've done our jobs properly, the engines should be coming back on line about now. You were right. The auxiliary tank is holding. Take the bridge, Commander. No. You're the senior officer here. I may be captain by rank, but I never wanted to be anything else but an engineer. Alright. Shields still holding but they are down another 15 percent. Can we use the phasers to open a hole in the sphere? No. The exterior shell is composed of carbon neutronium. Weapons would be ineffective. Mr. Data, we have to find some way out of here. Begin scanning for another portal that might still be open. The surface area is over 10 to the 16th square kilometers. It will take seven hours to scan, sir. I will endeavour to speed up the process. The Enterprise ion trail leads to this point. It looks like a doorway. I bet you two bottles of Scotch that they're inside the sphere and that they went in right through that hatch. No bet here. The question is how? Look at the momentum distribution of the ions. It would take an impulse engine full-reverse to put out a signature like that. So they didn't go in willingly. This looks like some kind of communications array. Aye. We found hundreds of them when we did our initial survey. Did you hail them? Aye. That was standard procedure. We did it right before we crashed. Yeah. Hailing is standard procedure today, too. Scotty. What if those aren't communications arrays? What if they're access terminals which are triggered by subspace signals on certain frequencies? Frequencies like our standard ship's hail. Exactly. The Enterprise, when they saw that terminal, did what you did. Opened a channel. But they triggered something that activated that hatch and pulled the ship inside. Very nice piece of reasoning. Nice, indeed. Yeah. We could trigger the hatch, only we'd get pulled in, too. Maybe all we need to do is to get our foot in the door. We might not be pulled inside when the hatch opens if we keep our distance from the sphere. Say, half-a-million kilometers. Then, when the hatch starts to close, we move in and we use the Jenolen to jam the hatch open, hoping that the Enterprise will escape. You can't be serious. That hatch is huge. It'll crush this ship like an egg. The shields will hold. Don't worry about that. I can get a few extra gigawatts out of these babies. It's crazy. Geordi. I have spent my whole life trying to figure out crazy ways of doing things. I'm telling you, as one engineer to another, I can do this. Alright. Let's do it. We're at 500,000 kilometers. Engines are ready. OK. Here we go. Come on. There's nothing out here. Give it up. That's it. Let's go. Full impulse. Sir, there's an audio message from Cmdr La Forge. Enterprise, do you read me? Go ahead. We read you. We're using the Jenolen to hold open the hatch. Our shields won't hold out. Understood. Ensign, set a course. The plasma intercooler's gone. The engines are overheating. I've lost helm control. La Forge to Enterprise. Captain, we won't be able to move when you get here. You'll have to destroy it to escape. How long before we reach them? With impulse engines at 60 percent, one minute, 40 seconds. Bridge to transporter room three, prepare to beam two from the Jenolen when we're within range. It's coming apart, lad. I can't do anything else. Photon torpedoes armed and ready. We are within transporter range. Bridge to transporter room, energize. Aye, sir. Fire torpedoes. There, now, that wasn't so bad, was it? Captain's log, stardate 46 125.3. Starfleet has dispatched two science vessels to study the Dyson Sphere while we proceed to Star base 55. So, this alien space baby, the size of a four-storey building, thought the Enterprise was its mother. You're pulling my leg. No, really. It was suckling power directly from the ship's fusion reactors. Dr Brahms and I changed the power frequency from 21 centimeters to 0.02 centimeters. So you soured the milk! That's right. Enjoy these times, Geordi. You're the chief engineer of a starship. And it's a time of your life that'll never come again. When it's gone, it's gone. I thought you were going to buy me a drink in ten-forward. Actually, I had a better idea. You're giving me one of your shuttles? Well, call it an extended loan. Since you lost your ship saving ours, it seemed only fair. She's not much to look at. Every woman has her own charm. You just have to know where to look. She's slow, but she'll get you to the Norpin Colony, if that's where you want to go. The Norpin Colony is for old men to retire. Maybe someday I'll end up there, but not yet. Well... Bon voyage, Mr. Scott. Thank you, sir, for everything. Mr. Scott. Goodbye. Bye-bye. Scotty. Thank you. Bye. Be well. A good crew. Yeah, they are. And a fine ship. A credit to her name. But I've always found that a ship is only as good as her engineer. From what I can see, the Enterprise is in good hands. You take care of yourself out there. Aye. (ENGLISH) "
S6E05,"Captain's log, stardate 46 154.2. The Enterprise has entered the Amargosa Diaspora, an unusually dense, globular cluster. We have the daunting task of charting this vast region. Lt Shipley, get a triangulation on these sector points. Aye, sir. Sorry I'm late. I overslept again. What have we got? Well, the cluster is dense. It'll take three days to map a tenth of it. Three days? We can speed that up. We've tested a way to channel warp energy to the deflector grid. It should enhance the sensors. The modification would increase our sensor efficiency and imaging by 25 percent or more. That would use up warp energy. We'd channel it through the EPS mains on deck four. OK. Let's give it a try. Data, let's get the field taps on line. Commander, I would like to remind you about my poetry reading. I wouldn't miss it for the world. I can't wait to see what he's come up with. We sat on the sand for some time and observed How the oceans that covered the world were perturbed By the tides from the orbiting moon overhead. ""How relaxing the sound of the waves is,"" you said. I began to expound upon tidal effects When you asked me to stop, looking somewhat perplexed. So I did not explain why the sunset turns red, And we watched the occurrence, in silence, instead. That poem was written in anapaestic tetrameter. For my ninth poem... I don't understand. I can't keep my eyes open. Throughout the ages, from Keats to Jorkemo, poets have composed odes to individuals who have had a profound effect upon their lives. In keeping with that tradition, I have written my next poem in honour of my cat. I call it Ode to Spot. Felis catus is your taxonomic nomenclature, An endothermic quadruped, carnivorous by nature. Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses Contribute to your hunting skills and natural defences. I find myself intrigued by your sub-vocal oscillations, A singular development of cat communications That obviates your basic hedonistic predilection For rhythmic stroking of your fur to demonstrate affection. A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents, You would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance. And when not being utilized to aid in locomotion, It often serves to illustrate the state of your emotion. Commander, you have anticipated my denouement. However, the sentiment is appreciated. I will continue. O Spot, the complex levels of behaviour you display Connote a fairly well-developed cognitive array. And though you are not sentient, Spot, and do not comprehend, I nonetheless consider you a true and valued friend. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. I have no problem getting to sleep. Then I think I'm sleeping all night. When I wake up, I feel exhausted. How long has this gone on? Two, three days. Do you have to hold it that close? I'm sorry. I've been on edge all day. Well, other than some muscle tension in your neck, I don't see anything physically wrong. Any bad dreams? Not that I remember. This could be the result of lack of REM sleep. What do you recommend? Drink this before bed. What is it? A recipe for a warm-milk toddy. A hot-milk toddy? You're kidding. The heat activates the amino acids in the lactose. A natural sedative. It's a recipe of the Captain's Aunt Adele. It's delicious. I'll try anything. If it still bothers you tomorrow, I'll run further tests. Thanks. Everything's in place. Warp-grid couplers, subspace-field taps. Alright, let's do it. Lt Shipley, initiate warp-power transfer. Aye, sir. Verifying sensor calibration. EPS mains stable. Sensor array on line. Come on, work. Geordi, active scanner output has increased by 26 percent. Inform Astrophysics that the new La Forge sensor array is on line and awaiting major discoveries. Yes, sir. Geordi, may I make a personal enquiry? It concerns my poetry reading. Sure. What is it? I noticed that many spectators seemed distracted during my presentation. Was my poetry uninteresting? Well, it was very well constructed, a virtual tribute to form. Thank you. And? And what? Did it evoke an emotional response? Well... Your hesitation suggests you are trying to protect my feelings. However, since I have none, I would prefer you to be honest. An artist's growth depends upon accurate feedback. Well, your poems were clever, Data. And your haiku was clever. And your sonnet was clever. But did it evoke an emotional response? To be honest, no, I don't think so. Then I did not succeed. No, it's not that you didn't succeed. You accomplished a lot, but... If you want to touch people, don't concentrate on rhyme and meter. Think more about what you want to say instead of how you're saying it. It's a power grid warning. I read a massive EPS explosion. Where? I am attempting to localize it. It is cargo bay four. Three people are in there. Damage control. Medical team to cargo bay four. Let's go. The field imbalance has subsided. There may still be a residual discharge. Stand clear. Is there something wrong? There's no evidence of an EPS explosion. The sensors thought there was. My modification may have caused a pattern-recognition failure. Just a glitch? That's my guess. Let's perform a level-three diagnostic on the internal sensors. Make sure we haven't overlooked anything. Could we pick this up in the morning? A fresh start? Would you do me a favour? Stop by my quarters, 0700 hours? I'm having trouble waking up. Sure. Goodnight. Goodnight. Commander. Gordon. Who is it? It's La Forge. Come in. Good morning. Morning? I just went to bed. Commander, it's 0700 hours. She said, ""If they're not squirming, we won't eat them."" Mr. Worf, my good Klingon. Sir, welcome. What a pleasure it is to have you back with us again so soon. So, Lieutenant, haircut today? Trim your beard? I would like my hair trimmed. A trim. Not like last time. No. Just a little off the top. I took way too much off last time. I was just telling my colleague, Mr. Setti, how thick and luxuriant Klingon hair is. It's such a pleasure to cut. Sometimes, I get carried away. All those away missions, the wind and dry air, the elements really are harsh on the hair. I'd like to suggest you start using a conditioning agent. I promise, not too much off the top. Just before the alarm, we ran warp power through this junction. Somehow, it must have tripped the internal scanners. It showed up as an EPS explosion? Yes, but why? I've modified the sensors before. Nothing like this has ever happened. We can't waste time chasing sensor ghosts. We should keep it off line until we can get a closer look. Excuse me. I know the feeling. It seems like as soon as my head hits the pillow, it's time to get up. We could all use a little shore leave. Definitely. Keep me posted. Yeah. Data, could you give me a hand? I need to run a structural-integrity scan. I want to make sure... What is it? This is the second time today that my visor has just cut out. Are you alright, Geordi? I don't know. I just got a very weird feeling. Maybe I should go to sickbay. I will run the integrity scan. Thanks, Data. This is curious. There's a slight bacterial infection around your neural inputs. It was interrupting the data stream. An infection? What from? It doesn't match any bacterial strains on record. I'm going to have to sterilize the area. But I need to run a resonance tissue-scan to search for signs of additional infection. Come over here. Sit down. Now, come forward. Now, you're going to need to hold very still. How's it going? I just started. Did you not go to sickbay? I've been there for over an hour-and-a-half. That is not possible. My chronometer indicates you have been gone for one minute, 15 seconds. I'm telling you, I've been gone for over an hour. Computer, what is the time, please? The time is 1427 hours. You are correct. 90 minutes, 17 seconds have passed since you left. What have you been doing? I have no memory of events during that period. When we finish, I'll perform a diagnostic. You know, first a false EPS explosion, then my visor cuts out, now you lose an hour, all in this cargo bay. La Forge to Engineering. Diagnostic team to cargo bay four. On our way. Cartography needs a better position to study cluster FGC-13. Bring us about, heading 123, mark four. Aye, sir. Helm won't lock to those coordinates, sir. First time navigating through a globular cluster, Ensign? You have to compensate for the gravimetric interference before... Is there something wrong, sir? No. I don't know. Put us back on our original heading. Don't tell me... This can't be right. Data, come here and take a look at this, would you? I think we have another sensor glitch. Sensors are functioning normally. They are detecting a subspace particle emission within this room. Within this room? That's impossible. The emission is emanating from this direction. Geordi. The bulkhead has been altered on a subatomic level. The metal is in a state of quasimolecular flux. What's causing it? This is where it gets wild. Behind that panel is a junction we used to transfer warp power. We're reading a subspace particle stream from that junction. It appears to be composed of spatially inverted tetryon particles. We believe they are from a tertiary subspace manifold. But I thought that tetryons were unstable. We don't understand it either, sir. Something from deep subspace can't exist in our universe. But there it is. Does it pose a danger? Not unless it spreads. If it does, we can beam the bulkhead into space and erect a force field in its place. Well, keep that option ready. In the meantime, proceed with the analysis. When I sat at the console, it was like I'd been trapped. I had to get out. Was it the console? No. I felt like I was disconnected. Like it was something that I had dreamed. You're the third person today with something like this. An intense, emotional response provoked by an object. Did any of them know why? No, they couldn't explain it any more than you. At this point, I won't say it's coincidence. Maybe we should all get together. Talking about it would help you understand your response. I'll find out if anyone else has had these experiences. Will, you told me you had an unusual experience at the console. Why don't you describe it? It was vague, the way you recall a dream. I remember the sensation of feeling trapped and something about a smooth surface. I had a similar response, but to a pair of scissors. Have you dreamt about scissors recently? I have no distinct memory of it. When my visor cut out in the cargo bay, I had a weird feeling, too, about a smooth surface. It was smooth and cold. Yeah, it was cold. Yes. Cold. It was elevated? A platform. Right. Like a bench. Or a table. It seems you've all had a similar experience. Is there anything else you remember, besides a table? Maybe we could help ourselves remember more. You all remember a table. Let's start with that. Computer, show me a table. There are 5, 047 classifications of tables on file. Specify design parameters. Can you be more specific? You mentioned it was smooth and cold. Can you remember its shape? Long. It was long. Yeah. And it had a rectangular shape. Computer, show me a rectangular conference table. It's too high. Computer, reduce the height of the table by 25 percent. The table was smaller. And it was inclined. Computer, decrease the table's surface area by 20 percent and incline the top 15 degrees. No, it wasn't made of wood. It was smoother. More metallic. Computer, make this a metal table. Yeah. Yeah, that's starting to look right. Was there anything else in the room? Furniture? Chairs? A door? Other people? No, it was dark. Yes, it was dark. I couldn't see beyond the table. Computer, lower the surrounding light level. There was a light right in my face. A bright light. Computer. Give me a bright light right above the table. Specify light source. I couldn't tell. It was above me. An overhead lamp. Estimated distance of light source. I don't know. It was at least two or three meters above. Brighter. Brighter. You said you were uneasy at the conn position. Yes. I felt trapped by the console. But it wasn't like this. There was something else here. A restraint of some kind? Yes, there was a restraint. It was flat and metal. It was made of metal. It came down over my legs. No, no. It was across my chest, right here. It was holding you down? Yes. It was part of a table. It was right here. Computer, create a restraining arm attached to the right side of the table at midpoint. Was it like that? Computer, put controls on the restraining arm. A control panel. Lights. There was something else there. Over the head of the table. A metal swing arm. Computer, create a metal swing arm. Double-jointed, total length, one meter. Connect it to the head of the table. There was something attached to it. A tool. Scissor-like. Computer, produce a pair of scissors attached to the armature. The handle is wrong. It was not scissors. Computer, make the handle a single-piece grip. Ten centimeters long, solid metal. Now, make one blade longer, curved inward. Give the other a jagged edge. Alright. You were lying on the table. You had a bright light shining in your eyes. Were there any smells in the room? Were there any sounds? Yes. Yes, there was a sound. Computer, there were noises coming from the darkness. Strange. Like whispering. More like clicks. Clicking sounds. Louder. Faster. More of them. I've been in this room before. We've all been here before. Here it is again. Something has caused high levels of serotonin to be produced in Geordi's visual cortex. When I examined him, I thought it was a bacterial infection. But I find the same thing in all three. They all have elevated levels of serotonin concentrated in the hippocampus, which suggests they've been exposed to a neuro-sedative. That's not all. I have detected minute tetryon-particle traces in their subdermal tissues. Tetryons? Like the emissions in the cargo bay. I have completed my self-diagnostic. I was not aboard the Enterprise for 90 minutes, 17 seconds yesterday. Are you sure? When I am on the ship, the warp field leaves a signal on my internal servo-fluid system. Between the period of 1254 to 1426 hours, that signature is missing. Computer, are there any members of the crew missing? There are two crew members unaccounted for. Identify them. Lt Edward Hagler and Ensign Sariel Rager. When did they leave? They have not been present since 2332 hours. How did they leave? Method of departure unknown. Picard to bridge. Bridge here. Raise shields. I want a level-four security alert. I need to know if anyone comes on or off this ship. Mr. La Forge, Mr. Data. I think if we find the source of those tetryon emissions, we'll find the missing crew members. We're on it, sir. Dr Crusher? My God! What is it? It looks as though your arm has been severed, then reattached. What? The skeletal structure in your radius and ulna is offset by 0.02 microns. Your arm has been amputated and surgically reattached. Any progress with the analysis? Look at this. Data, the tetryon emissions have intensified. They seem to be focusing in this direction, coalescing here. They're reading as a point of subspace energy. It appears to be the beginnings of a spatial rupture. The tetryon emissions are modulating in a way that looks like somebody's controlling the energy. You know, the signals from the modifications to the sensor array, some of them dig deep into subspace. Maybe they caught somebody's attention. At this rate, we will be in danger of hull breach. We should surround it with a subspace containment field. Other than the tetryon emissions, our internal sensors haven't recorded anything unusual. Initiate a metallurgical analysis of the hull. Subspace incursions may have left a trace. Captain, sensors indicate Lt Hagler has returned to the Enterprise. He is in his quarters, deck nine, section 17. Computer, emergency entry. Chief Medical Officer Crusher. Crusher to sickbay. A plasma-infusion unit to deck nine, section 19. His blood is turning into a liquid polymer. We've set up a containment field, but the rupture just keeps expanding. We've got five to six hours before it breaches the hull. Can we still beam it into space? No, sir. The spatial rupture is creating nucleonic interference. It is impossible to obtain a lock on the bulkheads. Has your analysis suggested any way in which we might seal this rupture? We think we can close the rupture with a coherent graviton pulse. We have to do that at the source. How do we find the source? Good question. The emissions come from a tertiary subspace domain, but subspace has an infinite number of domains. It's a huge honeycomb with an infinite number of cells. We need to isolate the exact cell these emissions come from. If someone homed on to the subspace signals created by our modified signal array, could we do the same to them? Track the tetryon emissions to their universe? Tetryon particles have a random momentum. Our sensors cannot track them. Perhaps we could construct a homing device. Something that our sensors could track. Good idea, but there's no way to get that device to the source. Yes, there is. Give it to me. They've taken me for the last few nights. The same thing will happen tonight. If you had a homing device, we could track it in subspace. As soon as they send you back, we could neutralize the emissions. If they send him back. Ensign Rager hasn't been returned. They're going to take me, whether I want to go or not. We could wait as long as possible for you to be returned. But when the spatial ruptures threaten the ship, then we would have to transmit that graviton pulse. Understood. Perhaps there's a way that we could give you an advantage. A way of keeping you conscious after they've taken you. Doctor, can you develop some counteragent to the neuro-sedative they have been giving the crew? I could give you a neuro-stimulant. The dosage would have to be high to counteract the effects. It's risky. I'm willing to take that risk. Make it so. Mr. La Forge, begin work on that homing device. This should ward off their neuro-sedative for about 12 hours. I hope it's enough. It's gonna have to be. I can't risk a higher dose. I've locked this tricorder into a continuous cycle. That way, it will keep recording, open or not. Hopefully, you can bring back information about their domain. We modified an emitter to transmit a beacon. When the indicator lights up, we've locked on to your location. Understood. Captain, Cmdr Riker has been taken from the Enterprise. Mr. La Forge, report. I still can't locate the homing signal in the energy band. We're extending the scan to adjacent levels. Mr. Data, your status? The rupture has expanded another 4.2 percent. Without reinforcement, containment-field integrity will fail in 14 minutes. Can you divert more power? I can augment it with auxiliary power. It won't be much. Make it so. Aye, sir. Captain, I've located the homing signal. Locking on to it now. It's coming from a subspace energy level of 16.2 keV. Stand by to initiate the graviton pulse. Graviton emitter is at full power, sir. Mr. Data, how much time? Failure will occur in nine minutes. The containment field is beginning to fluctuate. Failure anticipated in three minutes, 11 seconds. We can't afford to wait any longer. Begin the graviton pulse. Initiating pulse now. Data to Engineering. The graviton pulse is having an effect. Tetryon emissions have decreased by 19 percent. Captain, additional subharmonics have appeared. They are reinforcing the emissions. They appear to be counteracting the graviton pulse. The rupture is beginning to expand again. Looks like somebody is fighting back. Can you strengthen the pulse? I can set up a random-frequency shift. If we stop them guessing our modulation, they might not be able to compensate. Tetryon emissions continue to increase. The rupture is expanding. Hull breach is imminent. They're reacting faster than we can shift frequencies. Shipley, program the emitters for full spectrum pulse compression. I want to channel all the energy into one burst. See if they can handle that. Ready. The rupture is beginning to close. Let's hit them again. Come on. Ready. The rupture is 86 percent closed. One more burst should do it. Emitters recharging. Captain's log, stardate 46 191.2. The tetryon emissions in cargo bay four have ceased. There have been no further signs of alien intrusions. All crew members are safe and accounted for. But we are still left with some unanswered questions. Based on the information from Cmdr Riker's tricorder, the molecular structure of the aliens is solanagen-based. They couldn't come into our space as easily as they could take us into theirs. They needed to learn to remodulate their cellular-energy states. They created a small pocket of our universe in their laboratory to keep those they abducted alive. Like putting a fish in a bucket of water. In cargo bay four, they tried to create a pocket of their universe. What can we do to prevent this? Looks like they found us through my modified sensor signal. We should warn all Starfleet ships not to make that mistake. Do we know what came through the rupture before we shut it down? No, sir. We were unable to track it. Maybe it was a probe. Possibly they were simply curious. Explorers like ourselves. Ensign Rager and I were lucky to have escaped. Lt Hagler's dead. Whoever it was that sent that thing was more than simply curious.

S6E06,"Captain's log, stardate 46192.3. We have arrived at Star base 112 and are loading relief supplies for Tagra IV, an ecologically devastated planet in the Argolis Cluster. We have also taken on a rather unusual passenger. Welcome, Miss Rogers. I'm delighted to have you on board. Thank you. And congratulations. I understand you were selected for this internship from hundreds. Yes, sir. I still can't believe they chose me. There were others better qualified. Her transcript is impressive. She's done work in neurobiology, plasma dynamics and eco-regeneration. I'd say that's pretty well-rounded. A nice way of saying I haven't decided what to do with my life. You'll work in all our departments while you're here. By the time it's over, you'll know what field you're interested in. Or what fields you're not interested in. Come. We're bringing up the cargo. We can leave in an hour. Escort Miss Rogers to her quarters. We need to discuss the Tagrans' medical needs. Miss Rogers? Yes? You've won yourself a rare opportunity. Avail yourself of it. I will, sir. And thank you. It'll take a few days before you know where everything is. If you need any help, use one of these comm panels. We're on deck seven, section four. You're right. I practically memorized the specs. You're a quick study. This is it. Is this for me? It's all yours. It's so big. For honours students, only the best. Well, I could have brought my zoo. Your zoo? That's what my parents call it. Three dogs isn't that many, is it? It depends how they get along. I could have had a dozen. Mother said enough is enough. I'm sure gonna miss 'em. We'll keep you so busy, you won't. I've gotta get back to cargo bay two. Well, thanks for walking me down. Sure. No! No, I didn't mean it. You guys can't stay here. Come on, all of you. Hello. Come here, little one. You, too. Come on. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. See all these read-outs? That's your heart rate, blood pressure, all your vital signs. You're in good shape. You might just live to be my age. All these tricorders need testing before they can be sent to Tagra. So I should scan myself with each to make sure they're working? Any that doesn't, put aside and we'll do a diagnostic. OK. I hear you've been accepted to the Academy. I have a son there. Being posted on the Enterprise, you don't get to see him very often? No, not as often as I'd like. Do you have any other children? My husband died a number of years ago. Wes was our only child. Was he old enough to know his father? Jack died when he was five. My parents died when I was a baby. I don't remember anything about them. Sometimes, I wonder what they were like. Your adoptive parents are in Starfleet? Yeah, marine biologists. They've just been posted to the Bilaren System. Sickbay to Dr Crusher. You wanted to know when the cultures were ready. On my way. When you've finished, take the tricorders to the shuttle bay. OK. Thank you very much for your help. We can use every available hand. This is one of our largest relief efforts. Why bring everything down in shuttlecraft? We can't use the transporters due to ionization in the atmosphere. From the baristatic filters? How did you know that? I did a paper on eco-regeneration. A thousand baristatic filters put out quite a bit of ionization. A thousand? Yeah. They've polluted their atmosphere pretty badly. They go to such lengths to clean the air instead of regulating the emissions that cause the problem. Yeah, you're right. The only thing the filters can do is keep things from getting worse. They shoot the air... Commander. Are you alright? You OK? I didn't even see it coming. This is the main control area. We can access any primary circuit from all of these panels. Over here is a Jefferies tube. Where the major conduits are routed. You've done your homework. It's hard to imagine the energy in there. Imagination is not necessary. The scale is readily quantifiable. We are presently generating 12.75 billion gigawatts... Temperature in the reactor chamber is up 47 percent. Couplings are frozen. I can't slow the reaction. Temperature increase is at 106 percent and rising. Bridge. We're looking at a core breach. We'll have to vent the plasma. Inductors not responding. We'll lose containment. Everybody, out of here now. Let's go. Move it. Bring down the isolation door. Eject the warp core. Temperature in the reaction chamber has returned to normal. She's a little shaken up, but she's gonna be fine. You said she was adopted. Could she be an alien? She's human. There's nothing unusual about her that I can detect. Have you determined the cause of the warp breach? No. It was all normal, and then the laws of physics went out the window. And why shouldn't they? They're so inconvenient. Q! Mon capitaine. Are you responsible for this incident? Yes. I needed to find out if what I suspected about the girl were true. That being? That she's Q. Amanda's a Q? How is that possible? Her biological parents were human. Well, not exactly. They had assumed human form in order to visit Earth for amusement. But in vulgar human fashion, they conceived a child. And then like mawkish humans became attached to it. What is it about squirming infants that you find so appealing? That's beyond your comprehension. I desperately hope so. What happened to Amanda's parents? They died in an accident. None of us knew if she had inherited the capacities of the Q, but they've begun to emerge and, as an expert in humanity, I was sent to investigate. You, an expert in humanity? Not a very challenging field of study, I grant you. Are you saying you created a core breach just to test this girl? And if she couldn't stop it? Then I would have known she wasn't a Q. And now that you know, what do you intend to do? Instruct her. If this child does not learn how to control her power, she may accidentally destroy herself. Or all of you. Or your entire galaxy. I don't believe that you're here to do us a favour. You're quite right, I wouldn't, but there are those in the Continuum who have an over-exaggerated sense of responsibility. They want to take precautions to keep her from running amuck. And once you've taught her, then you'll go away? And leave her here? Of course not. She'll come back to the Continuum. Wait a minute. You can't take her from everything she's ever known. I assure you I can. She has plans. She wants to have a career and a family. I'm rescuing her from that miserable existence. That miserable existence is all she's known for 18 years. You have no right to take her away from it. Mon capitaine, I think that we need to speak privately. Well, there, that's better. Crusher gets more shrill with each passing year. Q, what is it you really want? Since you know so much about the Q, you can introduce me to the child. Let her know she can trust me. I don't trust you. Why should I expect Amanda to? She'd better, because I'm all she's got. She needs me to prepare her for her future with the Q. What if she doesn't want that future? It must be her decision. Yes! Do you think she will want to remain an enfeebled mortal? But if she really is Q, she must understand what that means. Very well. I will introduce you. But we cannot argue like this in front of her. We must at least appear to be... Pals? Civil. I knew I could count on you, Jean-Luc. Mr. Data, I want you to access any available records on Amanda Rogers. Yes, Captain. I want to know about her biological parents, about their death. I find it odd that any Q could die in an accident. It is not consistent with what we know, sir. I'm convinced Q isn't telling us everything. See what you can find out. Aye, sir. It started happening about six months ago. Things that I would wish for would just suddenly appear. I thought I was going crazy. In a funny way, finding this out is kind of a relief. I can understand that. This person I mentioned, from the Q Continuum, would like to meet you. If it's alright with you. I'm ready. Good. There's my girl. Amanda, allow me to introduce Q. He's an acquaintance of ours. We've known him for years. Impressive how you contained that explosion. What else have you done? I don't understand. Telekinesis? Teleportation? Spontaneous combustion of someone you don't like? That sort of thing. What Q is asking is have you ever deliberately used your abilities? Not until I came here. The first time was when the container almost fell on Cmdr Riker. You handled that well. That's why I gave you a greater challenge. The warp-core breach. She has potential, this one. She can return right now. What? Q. I don't want to go anywhere. Don't worry, with time you'll overcome your disadvantages. No one will hold it against you for having been human. Let's go. Leave me alone! I'm not going anywhere with you. You agree she has a right to choose her own future. Then you try to abduct her. You're overreacting as usual. I was merely testing her powers. She's quite a little spitfire now. What's going on, Q? What's your real purpose here? I've been clear. The Continuum has a vested interest in this woman. If you wish to protect that investment, approach her differently. She was being impetuous. She'll just have to start behaving like a Q. If I'm not mistaken, she just did. You understand, don't you? It's just that I have these things I want to do. I'm going to go to the Academy, I want a career, and I want to join Starfleet. You can still do all those things. It just seems so complicated now. These powers that I have are just going to stand in the way. I don't want to deal with that. Well, you're going to have to. Listen, I can only imagine how you feel. And it certainly would be easier if this would just go away. But it's not going to go away. And you need someone to help you. And the person who can help you is Q. But he's so horrible. He is the only one who can help you to understand who you are. Amanda, you are going to have to make some hard choices about your future. And you can't make them if you're going to ignore the truth. Yeah. I know. But I don't want any of this to disrupt my time here. I want to do everything that I'm expected to do. And I don't want you to treat me any differently. Please. You've got a deal. When you're free, join me in the Medical lab. I have an experiment I need your help with. Yes, ma'am. Your progress, Q? As anticipated, there are some problems. I need time. However, it's possible we won't have to terminate the girl. Come in. Hello, my dear. I've been told I behaved badly. I apologize. Apparently, you had every reason to chastise me. But then again, what's done is done, right? I'd like to ask some questions. Anything. What exactly are the Q? It would be so much easier to show you than tell you. If you would agree to take a visit to the Continuum... No, just tell me. Well, to put it simply, we're omnipotent. There's nothing, nothing we can't do. And what do you do with this power? Anything we want. Do you use it to help others? I think you've missed the point. Clearly, you've spent far too much time with humans. As a Q, you can have your heart's desire, instantly, whatever it is. Would you like precious jewels? Works of art? Would you like to walk along the rings of Tautine? I'm not interested in any of those. Of course not. You're a Q. But surely there must be something that you want? Something that you never dreamed was possible. Tell me, Amanda. What is it? I'd like to know what my parents looked like. My real parents. How quaint. So do it. What do you mean? Summon the image. I don't know how. Think about them. Evoke the memory. You can do it, Amanda. Trust me. Close your eyes. In your mind, return to the time when you were an infant. Think about your parents. Remember them. Good. Now, open your eyes. They loved me. Wait for it to be metabolized at another 20? Wait for it to be metabolized over and over, and wait till the bacilli can't be absorbed any more. That's right. Just be sure and record the rate of mitosis from each of the dishes. Mitosis, right. You seem distracted. Well, I just saw my parents. My real parents. Q showed me how. Can you imagine how that felt? No, I don't think I can. You know, you were right, I can't ignore what's happened to me. I just don't know if I can cope with it. Amanda, you are stronger than you think. You know, when I saw them there, right in front of me, I realized that I caused this to happen. I wanted to see them and I did. If it were you, if suddenly you could have anything you wanted, ... ..what would it be? I have no idea. No, think about it. Really think. If suddenly you could make anything happen, what would it be? Well, I would probably want to heal people, people who are hopelessly ill. Would you bring your husband back? Amanda, I don't know. And I don't think that I could make a decision like that until I was actually faced with it. I am faced with it. Try to do the work. I'll check on you later. I thought she'd never leave. I don't know if I'll ever get used to that. It's time for another lesson. Well, I have to finish this experiment first. What are you doing? We're delivering live vaccine bacilli to Tagra. I'm meant to find the best nutrient solution to keep them living while they're in stasis. Fascinating. I've just had a splendid idea. Why don't we combine what you're doing with our lesson, and you'll finish in no time. I should finish it the way Dr Crusher showed me. She'd be delighted if we sped things along. Think what it would mean. You could triple the workload. Well... Good. I guess so. Now, as you take a look at the tissue samples, ... ..form an image in your mind. Dr Crusher has some live vaccine bacilli for Tagra to be shipped in a stasis field. Can you arrange it? I'll get right on it. Captain, message coming in from Tagra IV. On screen. Enterprise, I am Orn Lote, Engineer. We are having difficulties with the reactor that powers our baristatic filters. We may have to shut it down for repairs. Could my Chief Engineer assist? I hope so. If we're forced to disable the reactor, it would take months to re-establish the ionic currents the filters have formed in the atmosphere. Send us your specifications. I'm sure we can help. Thank you. Captain? What is it, Mr. Data? I have some information regarding Amanda Rogers' parents. They died in Topeka, Kansas. Their home was destroyed during a tornado. Tornado? Why wasn't it dissipated by the weather-modification net? Unknown. The bodies were discovered after the storm passed. See if you can find any more details. I'd like to know more. Aye, sir. Well, if it isn't Number Two. I was looking for Dr Crusher to see what nutrients to send. I'm not sure. I'll tell her to contact you. Thanks. You could stay here and wait for her, if you, you know, wanted to. Tell her I'll be in shuttle bay two. You're attracted to him. I am not. I think you are. How repulsive. How do you stand that hair all over his face? Doctor, Cmdr Riker was looking for you. He's in shuttle bay two. Thank you. Have you finished already? Yes. How did you do it so quickly? Q helped. It took us half the time it would have normally taken. That explains this data. I needed to know the rates of mitosis. By artificially inflating them, you made the experiment useless. Now I have to do it all over again. I'm sorry, Doctor. Don't be sorry. If she wants to make things difficult, that's her business. Why did you interfere? She's a Q. Making her plod through human chores is beneath her. She asked to be treated normally. Don't bore her. I don't interfere with what you do. You'd be incapable! You should do the same. And you stay out of mine. Well, when you put it like that, I think you're absolutely right. Captain? Yes, Mr. Data? I have more information on the tornado that killed Amanda's parents. What is it? It was unusually compact yet extremely powerful. Its wind velocity was characteristic of a funnel three times its size. Download the files to my ready room. I'll study them there. Aye, sir. Have you practised teleportation? Yes, but it's hard. I keep ending up somewhere I don't want to be. It won't do to be sloppy. You should hone your abilities. I have a wonderful idea. Why don't we play a little game? I'll hide somewhere on the ship and you find me. But how do I know how? Don't worry, Amanda. You can do it. Not bad. Not bad at all. If we use phase buffers, we may be able to devise a mechanism that can be integrated into the present system. You're still thinking like a human. Now do you understand? What do humans have to offer that even begins to compare with that? Your future contains wonders you can't even imagine. The universe could be your playground. Dr Crusher and Counsellor Troi, they're taking me to dinner. You don't have to eat, you know. It's a nasty human habit you could easily do without. Hello, Amanda. Are you ready? Yes. Well, Amanda, how are you feeling about this now? It must be overwhelming. It was at first, but now I'm enjoying myself. Hello, ladies. Hello, Will. Cmdr Riker. Won't you join us? I'd love to, but I have other plans. Hi. Hi. So, how are your lessons going? Is Q being patient with you? Amanda? What is this all about? I thought it might be nice to spend some time alone together. I think it would be nice if you took us back to ten-forward. Are you sure you wouldn't want to stay here with me for a while? The moonlight is so beautiful. Isn't it nicer here than at ten-forward? Yes, it's very pleasant, but that's not the point. I think it is. No. You can't snatch people and put them into your fantasies and expect them to respond. Don't you like me? Even just a little bit? You're a very lovely young lady. But none of this is real. My feelings are real. I know. But you can't make someone love you. Can't I? Oh, Amanda. You are so beautiful. Do you love me? More than anything. You're right. None of this is real. I thought it would be romantic, ... ..but it's empty. Amanda. Just go back to ten-forward. Bonjour, mon capitaine. You wanted to speak with me. I wanted to ask you about Amanda's biological parents. When they decided to remain on Earth, what was the reaction in the Q Continuum? We found it incomprehensible. Were they pressured to return? Were they threatened if they didn't? What are you driving at, Picard? The circumstance of their deaths is odd. A tornado somehow escaped the weather-modification net and touched down in only one spot. Amanda's home. You can never predict the weather. But tornadoes develop from existing storm fronts. But there were no storm fronts in Kansas that day. Witnesses report the funnel materialized spontaneously, directly over Amanda's home, destroyed it and disappeared. If you say so. I wasn't there. Were Amanda's parents executed by the Q Continuum? And what if they were? She has a right to know that before making a choice about her future. Don't be foolish, Picard. She has no choice. She never did. If she's truly a Q, she must return to the Continuum where she belongs. But if she were a hybrid, neither human nor Q, then... You would be so despicable? Don't be naive. You have no idea what it means to be Q. With unlimited power comes responsibility. Do you think we can allow omnipotent beings to roam free through the universe? So what have you concluded? Does she live or does she die? I haven't decided yet. Captain's log, stardate 46 193.8. We have arrived at Tagra IV and begun delivering supplies. In the meantime, I face a crisis of a different nature. Look, I have no reason to believe that Q is lying. He claims he has orders from the Continuum. If Amanda cannot prove she is fully Q, he must kill her. We have to tell her. I don't know if we should. It almost seems cruel. Maybe she can protect herself. After all, she has a great deal of power. So did her parents. It didn't save them. I agree with the Counsellor. Amanda deserves to know her situation. We have no right to hold such crucial information from her. But it isn't going to be easy telling her. What is your impression of the field modulator? Quite ingenious. I... I'm amazed at how it is incorporated with the existing system. Commander, we're all loaded. We can head for the surface. I'm eager to see the field modulator in place, Commander. I... We'd better get going. Yes. Kill me? But why? They're not convinced that you are fully Q. And they are also responsible for your parents' death. My parents? But what right do they have? Q? Answer me. Are you afraid to face me? She's such a plucky little thing now, isn't she. I really do enjoy you, you know. Amanda's question deserves an answer. You've made yourself judge, jury and, if necessary, executioner. By what right have you appointed yourself to this position? Superior morality. Yes. I recall how you used your superior morality when we first met you. You tried us for the crimes of humanity. The jury's still out on that, Picard, make no mistake. Your arrogant pretence at being the moral guardians of the universe strikes me as being hollow, Q. I see no evidence that you are guided by a superior moral code, or any code whatsoever. You may be nearly omnipotent, and I don't deny that your parlour tricks are very impressive, but morality? I don't see it. I don't acknowledge it, Q. I would put human morality against the Q's any day. And perhaps that's the reason that we fascinate you so. Because our puny behaviour shows you a glimmer of the one thing that evades your omnipotence, a moral centre. And if so, I can think of no crueller irony than that you destroy this young woman, whose only crime is that she's too human. Jean-Luc, sometimes I think the only reason I come here is to listen to these wonderful speeches of yours. But this time, your concern is unwarranted. We've decided not to harm her. And we are prepared to offer her a choice. What kind of choice? Come to the Continuum with me... Or? Now this choice is more difficult. You have it within yourself to refrain from using the power of Q. If you do that, you can stay here. Then, I'm staying here. Think about this. This is not so easy. Your parents were given this choice and they were unable to resist the temptation of using their power. All I've wanted since this whole thing began is to become a normal human being again. I know I can resist. Worf to Picard. Emergency message from Cmdr Riker. I'm on my way. Captain, the damage to the reactor is greater than we were told. The field modulator is operational, but it won't be enough. The reactor's overloading. Can you correct it? Geordi is trying now. We will stay as long as possible. There are thousands here, if the reactor goes... Commander. Quickly. Is this your doing, Q? Not this time, Picard. Mr. Worf, see if we can cut through the interference and beam them out. Aye, sir. Captain, Geordi is trying a neutrino infusion to smother the reaction. There's too much ionization. Transporters are useless. The heat has fused the injector. We're losing containment. How long till meltdown? A few minutes. Look at this! This is impossible. I don't know what's happening, but the reaction is stabilizing on its own. Captain, I am reading a massive energy fluctuation in the atmosphere. On screen. Contaminants have dropped to less than one part per trillion. The ecosystem has been restored to its natural state. Amanda? I told you it would be harder to resist than you thought. I couldn't let all those people die. Ever since I got here, I've been fighting this. I've been denying the truth. Denying what I am. I am Q. Dr Crusher, I've decided that I can't stay. I can't stay here. Well, now that you've come to your senses, let's go. No. I want to go and see my parents first. It'll take time to explain all this, so you'll have to be patient. I hope I can come back and see you. You're a Q. You can do anything you want. (ENGLISH) "
S6E07,"Captain's log, stardate 46235.7. Ensign Ro, Keiko O'Brien, Guinan and I are returning to the Enterprise after a fascinating visit to the planet Marlonia. And these pieces I found on the tertiary level of the dig. They're typical of 2nd-century Marlonian cookware. Look at those markings, very similar to early Taguan designs, but the patterns are more intricate, they're much closer to Buranian. You were on the most beautiful planet in the quadrant, and you spent your entire shore leave in a cave? It was a very rewarding experience. Look at these fragments. They're nearly in perfect condition and yet they're 700 years old. So's my father. Is that a Draebidium froctus? Actually, it's Draebidium calimus. You can tell by the leaves. I didn't know you were interested in plant biology. I took a class at the Academy. I don't remember very much though. Enterprise to the Fermi. This is the Fermi. Go ahead. We've received a distress signal from the science team on Ligos VII. Can you identify the problem? No. The call was cut off in mid-transmission. Lay in a course and engage at warp eight as soon as we're on board. Aye, sir. Rendezvous with the ship in three minutes, sir. We're caught in an energy field. Hard about, full-impulse. Aye, sir. What's happening? The shuttle is in an energy field. Engines and life support have failed. Full-impulse. Bridge to transporter room three. Beam the shuttle crew back once we're in range. Ready, sir. I can't contact the Enterprise. Too much interference. Transfer power to inertial dampers. Warning. Structural failure imminent. Have you got them? I'm trying. I can't get a pattern lock. The shuttle is coming apart! Do it now! I've got them. There's a 40-percent drop in mass. I may have lost one of them. Thank you, Mr. O'Brien. Another moment and... Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. According to the bioscans, their DNA structure is consistent with preadolescence. But, as far as we can tell, only their bodies were changed. Their intelligence and their behavioural responses are the same as they were before the accident. What happened to the shuttle? It broke up after we beamed you out. Mr. Data is coordinating the salvage efforts now. Sir. What about the energy field? We're scanning it, but there's interference. Itll take time. We can't afford to stay here. We'll leave a probe behind to study it, but the distress signal from Ligos VII has top priority. Let me know when you have any more information. Number One, you're with me. Captain, I need to run some additional tests. Of course. The three of you remain as needed to assist Dr Crusher. What? You make a pretty cute kid. Great. Just what I want to be, cute. Were you this much fun when you were a kid? I was in a refugee camp. ""Fun"" wasn't in my vocabulary. What about now? You're not in that camp any more. Fun is being back at work, in my own uniform. Bridge. Mr. Worf, prepare to launch a probe to study the energy field. I realize how unusual this must seem. My appearance is a result of an accident involving myself and three other crew. The effects of which Dr Crusher is working to remedy. I assure you, I am Capt Picard. The probe. Aye, sir. Mr. Data, have you secured all of the shuttle debris? Almost. It is being stored in shuttle bay two. Sir. Very well. As soon as Mr. Data is finished, take us to Ligos at warp eight. Captain, may I see you privately for a few moments? Of course. Tea. Earl Grey. Hot. Have you determined the cause of our transformation? Not yet. I'm still waiting for some results. I see. There are 103 members of the science team on Ligos VII. We should prepare shuttle bay three in case they have many casualties. We'll be ready. I see Ligos VII is prone to periodic volcanic activity. Perhaps it's entered an active phase. Jean-Luc. We need to talk. Alright, let's talk. Are you here to relieve me of duty? I'd rather not have to take that step. I am still Jean-Luc Picard. My judgement, my experiences, my mental capacities are all intact. That's true. For now. But this could be the first stage of a condition that affects your mind. But you see no evidence of that. Not yet. What I do know is that the Captain of this ship has undergone an extreme physical transformation, the ultimate effects of which I can't even begin to guess. You are asking me to step down. You are still Jean-Luc Picard. What do you think you should do? Cmdr Riker, take command of the ship until further notice. Understood. So what the hell am I supposed to do now? You're not supposed to do anything. That's what ""relieved of duty"" means. I should be doing something instead of just waiting for a cure. You're right. Let's go play. What? I haven't been young for a long time, and I intend to enjoy every minute of it. Fine. Enjoy yourself. What are you gonna do? Go back to your room and pout? I am not 12 years old. If I want to go to my quarters and contemplate my situation, that does not mean that I am pouting. OK. I could use a cup of coffee. How about you? I'll get it. Two coffees, one with cream and sugar, the other... Black, double sweet. I know. One double sweet. Careful. That's hot. Miles. Sorry. What's wrong? It's... I don't know, but this feels wrong somehow. Miles Edward O'Brien, I am still your wife. Technically, yes. Technically? I mean, of course you're my wife. But you're also ten years old. Beverly said it's actually closer to 12. That's not the point. So what is the point? Is our marriage over? I didn't say that. But until they find a way to reverse this effect, it's hard to ignore the fact that you're a little girl. What if they can't find a way? What if I'm like this for the rest of my life? What does that mean for us? For our family? Mommy. Mommy. What's wrong, sweetheart? I want Mommy to read me a story. Alright. What story would you like to hear? Not you. I want Mommy. What if Daddy reads you a story? Will that be OK? I'll be right back. Keiko. It's gonna be alright. I promise. We'll work this out. How? I don't know. First Officer's log, supplemental. We have reached the Ligos system. We have begun to search for the missing science team. Dr Crusher reports no progress on a cure for the shuttle crew. Come. I came to see how you're doing. I'll have to speak to my tailor, but otherwise I'm well. Thank you. It's just so ridiculous. I can't take myself seriously like this. Counsellor, if Dr Crusher can't find a cure, if I have to stay this way, nobody's gonna take me seriously, are they? I would say the people that know you and have worked with you will be able to make the adjustment eventually. But some will find it difficult to accept a 12-year-old captain. I'll have to wait until I grow up again before I get another command. Which might be in ten, maybe 15 years. What to do until then? You're still a Starfleet captain. There are other assignments you could be given. I've spent 30 years on starships. I won't sit behind a desk now. You could return to the Academy. Brush up on your Latin. And be Wesley Crusher's roommate? I admit returning to the Academy does have a certain appeal. But I've spent my life looking forward. Going to the Academy again feels like looking back. Then perhaps you could spend the time exploring other interests. Archaeology, for instance. Leave Starfleet? Not permanently, just a sabbatical. You could spend a few years digging up artefacts and still become the youngest admiral in Starfleet history. It would give me a chance to take up Dr Langford's offer and accompany her to the ruins on Suvin IV. But to leave the Enterprise... In a way, you're very lucky. You might have a chance to do what most people only dream about. Have a second childhood without the pain of growing up again. This is Capt Picard's rybo-viroxic-nucleic structure from a tissue sample I took this morning. It's the same as a sample I took before the accident, except it's missing several of the key viroxic sequences. It's been a long time since I took genetics, Doctor. RVN is one of the key factors in our development during puberty. Unlike DNA, which never changes, RVN takes on additional sequences during adolescence. Those sequences determine how we develop physically. Without them we wouldn't mature? Exactly. Somehow, they were eliminated in the shuttle crew during transport. So what do we do? Well, we have a couple of options. These are the plants Keiko was carrying. Whatever turned the crew into children turned these into seedlings. I accelerated the growth on one of them, and it developed into a perfectly normal adult plant. That wouldn't work with people? No. But at least we know that if we do nothing, they will probably grow up just as they did before. That's one option. However, I do have the adult RVN patterns of all four of them. I might be able to send them back through the transporter and replace the missing sequences. But we can't do that until we know why this happened in the first place. If somehow they were to lose more viroxic sequences... They would get even younger. Chief, I got the sensor report on the shuttle break-up. It looks like it began near the starboard bulkhead. There's some bulkhead fragments over here. My visor's picking up some torsional stress damage, some micro-fractures. Hang on a second. What's this? Looks like tritanium from the hull. Yeah, but look. That's not tritanium any more. The molecular structure has been changed, broken down into its constituent elements. No wonder the bulkhead shattered. Yeah. I'll take a sample to Engineering and run a metallurgical analysis. Well, this is exciting. Would you rather be playing with dolls? I'd rather be doing almost anything other than watching you sulk. This isn't some kind of glorious second childhood, Guinan. Our bodies have been violated, changed. Doesn't that bother you? Sure it bothers me. But, at the moment, I can't do anything about it. So I might as well enjoy it. Enjoy what? You think being short and awkward is some kind of wonderful gift? There must have been some part of childhood that you didn't loathe. Look, it was a long, depressing period of my life, and I was grateful when it was finally over. I'd rather not relive it. I bet you were a jumper. A jumper. Someone who jumps up and down on furniture all the time. What? You were a jumper, alright. The quiet ones, they always look so innocent. You think you can turn your back on them. Next thing you know... They're bouncing on the bed. That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Most of the time, I had no bed. But you did have one sometimes, and I bet you jumped on it. I most certainly did not. Yeah, I can see it in your eyes. You can barely resist the urge to leap up and start jumping around like a Tarkassian razorbeast. Guinan. Yeah. This is ridiculous. That's right. And don't you dare join me, Ro Laren. You don't like jumping on beds. Yeah? I can jump higher. We think a molecular-reversion field caused the ship to deteriorate. When the field penetrated the hull, it affected the crew. When I tried to beam them off, I couldn't get a lock. The field was masking part of the patterns. The transporter only registered part of the RVN patterns. That explains the missing sequences. With those sequences missing, the transporter reconstructed them as children. Could the transporter reverse the effects? Maybe. As long as there's no reversion field to mask the patterns, we should be able to do it. Chief, can you adjust the scanners... Bridge to Cmdr Riker. Go ahead. We are entering orbit around Ligos VII. On my way. We'll discuss this later. Standard orbit, Ensign. Any sign of the science team? We've been scanning the area, but our readings are being disrupted. Cause? Extreme fluctuations in the electromagnetic field. However, there is no evidence of stellar or seismic activity to cause the interference. Any response to our hails, Mr. Worf? No, sir. I've been attempting to... Commander, two ships de-cloaking fore and aft. Klingon birds-of-prey. B'rel-class. Maximum shields. Take us out of orbit. Mr. Worf, prepare to return fire. Damage report. We have lost primary life support. Switching to secondary systems. Lock phasers on target. Phasers locked. Fire. Minor damage to one ship. Its shields are holding. Starboard power coupling is down. Warp engines are off line. Shields? Down to 13 percent. Casualties reported on deck 26 and 27. Sensors and secondary generators are off line. Life support down to 67 percent. Engineering, status report. They took out auxiliary power and emergency backup. It'll take an hour to get warp power back on line. We have lost shields. Heavy casualties on decks 35 to 40. I am detecting transporter signatures in three cargo bays. We are being boarded. Come with me. Initiate intruder alert. All Security teams report to... Put down your weapons! Computer, deactivate command functions. Authorization, Riker Omega three. All command functions suspended. This is Morta. We have secured the bridge. Begin transporting all able-bodied adults to the surface. Come on. Get up there. Come on. They have locked out the command functions. You said they would not have time. You led the assault team. You were too slow. You dare to blame me? We have secured the ship, DaiMon, but Morta's incompetence... My incompetence? You know... Enough! Where is the captain of this ship? I'm in command of this vessel. Who are you? And on whose authority...? I am DaiMon Lurin. And I declare this ship to be a loss and open to claim according to the Ferengi salvage code. You will cooperate with our salvage operations, or we will begin executing your crew. Is everyone alright? No injuries among the children. The Ferengi have taken control of Engineering and decks 23 to 37. We have to assume they have the bridge. What have they done with the younger children? With my little girl? They're taking all the adults down to the surface. They've kept the children on board. Where was she? In primary care on deck 14. She's probably still there. I wouldn't worry. We need to regain control of the ship. Options? Flood the ship with anesthezine gas. That's been locked out with the command functions. If they're typical Ferengi, they'll be pleased with themselves, maybe even getting overconfident. Agreed. They might think they don't need many crew to hold the ship. We could use surprise to give us a tactical advantage. Tactical advantage? Jean-Luc, look at your team for a minute. We're children. We can't allow our ship to be commandeered. I'm not suggesting that we do, but we can't act as if we were adults. What do you suggest we do? We look like children, maybe it's time we started acting like children. I hope your profit margin's high for this, because you're risking war with the Federation. We're not affiliated with the Ferengi Alliance. We are in business for ourselves. Yes, it will be highly profitable. For an investment of two surplus Klingon ships, a few repairs and some weapons, we've netted a Federation starship and her crew, not to mention a planet rich in vendarite. So that's what this is all about. What did you do with the science team? They've proved most helpful in extracting the mineral. You used them as slave labourers. The addition of your crew will greatly speed up the process. As for your ship, ... ..Im sure that it will fetch a handsome price on the Romulan market. But before that can happen, we need to regain access to your central computer. You don't really think I'll help you? I think that mines on Ligos VII can be very hazardous. Now, how many people on your ship? 1014. Very hazardous, Commander. Hello. I'm the classroom computer. What can I do for you today? Computer, display interior security grid. I'm sorry, but I can't do that. Would you like to play a game? No, I would not. Computer, display an internal schematic diagram. I'm sorry, but I can't do that. Would you like to see some interesting plants or animals? It's a child's computer. Remember? Computer, can you show me a picture of the inside of the Enterprise? Yes, I can. The Enterprise is a Galaxy-class starship. Do you know how to spell Enterprise? E-N-T-E-R... Delete audio. Alright, this'll have to do. We're here. There's a service conduit that runs to here and leads to a Jefferies tube here. You and Ensign Ro will have to cross this corridor to get to Engineering. Captain. Excellent. Ready? Make it so. What the devil? I was just playing. I'm sorry, Captain. Alexander, would you mind if I borrowed your toy for a while? Go ahead. Thank you. After you. I've got the phasers, Captain. This is the first time these tubes haven't seemed cramped. How much farther do we have to go? About 50 meters. Don't tell me you're tired. I'm not as young as I used to be. This is it. Main Engineering. Now we wait. Report? Mission accomplished, sir. The one in sickbay never saw me. Very good. I'd say we're ready. Have you figured out how to get to the bridge? I'm afraid I can only think of one way. What do you want? I need to see my father. Go back inside. I need to see him now. Do not argue with me. Go back inside! I need to see him now! Stop it! You've hurt me! I want my father! Alright. Just stop that! Let me go! Here he is! Now be quiet! What is going on? Dad! So, son, how are you? I'm OK. How are your friends, Keiko, Guinan and Ro? They're OK, too. But... What's wrong? Well, we don't have anything to do. None of the games are working. The Ferengi made Daddy turn off the main computer. Can't you just turn on the kids' computer in schoolroom eight? We just want to play a few games. I don't know if they'll let me, but I will ask. Thanks, Number One. He's my number-one dad. Here they come. How did it go? Did Cmdr Riker get the message? He understood. We should have access very soon. Come in. I understand your son was here to see you. That's right. We Ferengi do not bring our offspring along with us aboard ship. Then, that's your loss. Our families are one of our strengths. I think you will find that they can also be a weakness. Unless you release the computer to our control, I will execute every child on this ship, beginning with yours. Even you wouldn't be that cruel. It is cruel to put children in danger by bringing them aboard a starship. Alright. Just so you don't harm my son. You will release the computer and show Morta exactly how to use it. Computer, release command control. Authorization, Riker Omega three. Command functions restored. OK, Morta. The system is controlled by three primary main-processor cores cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, 14 kiloquad interface modules. The core element is based on an FTL nanoprocessor with 25 bilateral kelilactirals, with 20 of those being slaved into the primary heisenfram terminal. You do know what a bilateral kelilactiral is? Well, of course I do, human. I am not stupid. No, of course not. This isopalavial interface controls the main firomactal drive. Don't touch that. You'll blow up the entire firomactal drive. What is... Wait. What is a firomactal drive? Just explain it to me. That is the firomactal-drive unit. It controls the ramistat core, and keeps the ontarian manifold at 40,000 KRGs. The drive is powered by... Command lockout has been released. Accessing transporter. Weapons-deactivation program in place. Transporter security force field standing by. We're ready. Tag. You're it. Yes? I found this in the schoolroom. Is it yours? That just leaves two on the bridge. Wait here until I return. Yes, sir. The ramistat kiloquad capacity is a function, square root of the intermix ratio times the sum of the plasma quotient. Come in. I believe you're in my chair. Captain's log, stardate 46236.3. We've taken Lurin and his men into custody. The Ferengi Alliance has denied any knowledge of these renegades. With the mining operation closed and our crew on board, we can now turn our attention to other problems. Phase inducers activated. Energy levels nominal. I'm loading the adult patterns. Transposition matrix locked in. That should do it, Captain. Energize. How do you feel? I feel fine. Everything seems a little smaller. It's my mother. The funny thing is, I never really drew a picture of her when I was young. It's just for some reason, I wanted to now. That's the wonderful thing about crayons, they can take you to more places than a starship. It's my turn, isn't it? Only if you're ready. It's not quite as bad as I remembered it. Being a child, I mean. Well, we'd better get going. Well, what's the hurry? I mean, the transporter will still be there. Why don't you pass me the royal blue? Here. Thank you. Did you do this one, too? I did all of them. All of them? (ENGLISH) "
S6E08,"Captain's log, stardate 46271.5. The Enterprise has entered orbit of Deinonychus VII but our rendezvous with supply ship Biko has been delayed by 48 hours. In the meantime, the crew are taking advantage of the delay to pursue their own projects, myself included. Computer, stop playback. Change the clarinet to an oboe. Continue recording. Computer, pause playback. Come. Yes, gentlemen? We'd like to take the Engineering computer off line for a few hours. We are working on an interface to allow Data to act as backup. In theory, my neural network should sustain key systems until primary control is restored. Intriguing. I'll be interested to see the results. Permission granted. It's possible we could run secondary systems through Data. I get the idea. Thank you. Please proceed. Computer, begin playback from the first measure. Computer, pause recording. Come. Jean-Luc, I need to talk about Something for Breakfast. Breakfast? The play. Yes. Well, it's a very intriguing drama. But I don't have the time it would take to learn a part. Anyway, I'm not much of an actor. That's no problem. You wouldn't be playing a lead. It's a very small part. Only two lines. Really? It's the role of the butler. I'll think about it and let you know. You would be wonderful, Jean-Luc. We're rehearsing today at 1:30. Computer, begin playback from the first measure. Computer, pause recording. Yes? Captain, sorry to interrupt. No, please, come in. I was hoping to stage ship-wide security drills. I have planned a schedule. This is very impressive. But we'll be taking on new personnel at Starbase 118. The drills can wait till then. In that case, I will use the time to check the forward phaser array. Mr. Worf, is there some reason why you're giving yourself more work? No, sir. I simply wish to use... Enjoy yourself. You have free time. Use it. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Computer, continue recording and playback once more. From the top. Father! What did he say? The Captain released me from my duties. You mean you can go? I can go. Saddle up, Father. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Where are we? Deadwood. 19th-century Earth. The Ancient West. What is our function here? You're the sheriff and I'm the deputy. So, we are in law enforcement. Right. Geordi, I have noticed that you have not shaved. Are you attempting to grow another beard? As a matter of fact, I am. What do you think? As with many natural growth processes, it is difficult to envision based on an intermediate stage. You're right. Give it a few more days. OK. I'm gonna need to access your auxiliary inputs. One moment. I must admit, I never get used to seeing you like this. I do not understand. You constantly work on similar electronic systems, yet their appearances do not disturb you. But you're not just another electronic system. Thank you, Geordi. Nor are you just another biological organism. Alright. That should do it. Are you ready? Yes. Establishing computer linkup. Interface complete. Alright. Let's see what you can do. You wrote this holodeck program? Well, Mr. Barclay helped a little. I must have a little talk with Mr. Barclay. If ever I find the varmint that drew this, he'll be sorry. I'm ten times uglier than that. Shut up. You laugh so much, it's a wonder you ain't got flies in your mouth. You're a very funny man, Seňor Eli. That's the bad guy. Eli Hollander, the Butcher of Bozeman. He's killed 23 men. He's the meanest, toughest gunslinger in the West. You have to watch him. He's fast. So I am here to apprehend him? If you can. You are under arrest. Is that so? You will come with me. No, no, no. Computer, freeze program. What is wrong? That was too easy. It has to be harder to beat the bad guys, otherwise, it's no fun. Computer, increase program difficulty to level four. Go back to where we first walked into the saloon. Come on, Father. If ever I find the varmint that drew this, he'll be sorry. I'm ten times uglier than that. Shut up. You laugh so much, it's a wonder you ain't got flies in your mouth. You're a very funny man, Seňor Eli. Where are they going? They don't wanna get hit by the bullets. You are under arrest. Well... Looks like Sheriff Worf's here to arrest me. That don't sound like a bright idea. Do it? You have been accused of committing a homicide. If you mean murder, then I guess I'm guilty. I've killed 23 men, Sheriff. One more ain't gonna make much of a difference. Of course, shooting someone as ugly as you couldn't be considered a crime, could it? Was you born that way or did your momma marry an armadillo? Sheriff, look out. I'm beginning to see the appeal of this. Don't twitch a whisker, Sheriff, unless you want a shave. OK, boys. Saddle up. But first, get their money and jewellery. You are a murderer and a thief. A man's gotta make a living. I suggest you find a new line of work. I asked Counsellor Troi to join us. She loves Western stories. You'll regret this, stranger. I am now attempting to access the long-range sensor array. Forward sensor array coming on line. We're getting a clear scan. I will perform a routine maintenance check on the inertial dampers. Dampers on line. Maintenance check in progress. Data, we're on to something here. Let's see about secondary systems. Try gravitational control. Initiating grav... What's wrong? There's an energy fluctuation in my neural net. I am disconnecting my interface to the computer. Interface deactivated. Are you alright? I have experienced a power surge in my positronic subprocessor. But I am fine. Maybe the interface coding isn't as stable as we thought. We've got a few hours of systems analysis before we try again. Let's check the interface programming. What are his rights? Is there a trial or shall I execute him? We're supposed to hold him till the US Marshal comes. Then we take him to Rapids City for trial. Frankly, I don't think I'll be around here that long, not after my old man hears about this. What old man are you referring to? My pa. When he breaks me out of this tin can, the grave digger'll be working overtime. Your pa is no match for Sheriff Worf. Yes. When your pa comes, we will be ready for him. He's right. You're no match for the Hollanders. I am sure that the three of us can handle any problems. Hold on. I was just passing, saw a little trouble and lent a hand. But I ain't one of your deputies, Sheriff. Counsellor, I would appreciate support in this matter. Durango. I'm called Durango. Yes. Counsellor Durango, would you consider becoming a temporary deputy? For a price. $500. Alexander, we require large amounts of currency. Yes, sir! I'll go to the bank and make a withdrawal. Deanna, how do you know so much about this period in Earth's history? My father read me stories from the Ancient West when I was little. I must admit, I always wanted to play the mysterious stranger. You are so brave, facing down that evil man like you did. Why, thank you, Ms...? Annie, you big galoot. You best not forget that tonight. Cos I'm gonna make you a beefsteak and gooseberry cobbler for dessert. Sounds delicious. And I bought some special candles for the table setting. Pure beeswax. I will not be able to come this evening. I have a prisoner. I'll keep an eye on him. You two have a good time. That's very considerate. But I would be negligent in my duties if I did not stay. Sorry. It's another woman. That floozy at Miss Langford's house of pleasure! Who? You sure got a way with women, Sheriff. Computer, activate Picard Mozart Trio, program one. Play back tracks one, two and three. Tempo allegro. Computer, stop playback. Computer, identify musical composition. Picard Mozart ""Trio"", program one. OK. Let's work through Act II from the beginning. Whenever you're ready. ""Felis catus is your taxonomic nomenclature, An endothermic quadruped, carnivorous by nature..."" Hold it. Will, what are you reading? The lines. Why? That's not the right dialogue. ""Your visual, olfactory and auditory senses..."" I recognize it. This is Data's poetry. What? The play's gone. I just keep getting more poetry. Well, the paths are functioning normally. Seems to be a problem with information retrieval. When you called up your play, the computer accessed Data's literary files. Perhaps this problem is related to our interface experiment. Better run a level-two diagnostic. See if this problem has spread. I will perform a self-diagnostic. Good idea. Let me know if you find the play. Yeah, don't worry. It's in here somewhere. We got him, jefe. Where's my boy? I'm not supposed to be kidnapped now. Computer, freeze program. Computer, freeze program. You want us to kill him, Seňor Frank? No. He's more valuable to us alive. Feline supplement 127. Spot, I have formulated a new mixture of food designed for your highly selective tastes. I find it difficult to predict what you will find acceptable. Perhaps hunger will compel you to try it again. Spot, you are disrupting my ability to work. Vamoose, you little varmint. What'll it be? I was looking for my deputy. Perhaps you have seen him. Nope. What'll you have? Klingon fire wine. This ain't Kansas City. We ain't got none of that fancy European stuff here. Maybe I should get you a sherry. Ain't that what they serve at Miss Langford's? It is, ain't it? Ain't it? Howdy, Sheriff. Commander. What are you doing here? The name is Frank Hollander. What are you looking at? Nothing. Nothing at all, Mr. Hollander. What do you want? My boy. That is impossible. Your son is to stand trial for murder. Well then, we'll just have to work something out. Is there anything you want in exchange for my boy? You have nothing I want. Is that so? Is that so? What about your deputy? What about him? Where is he? I do not negotiate with criminals. Your son will stand trial. Not so fast. Commander, what are you doing? I ain't in the mood for games, Sheriff. Commander? Computer, freeze program. I wouldn't walk out that door if I was you. What's wrong? The holodeck's safeguards are not functioning. Alexander's in trouble. My God, you've been shot! Computer, end program. Troi to Capt Picard. Troi to Security. There's another character in the program. Hollander's father. And he looks like Cmdr Data. Data? But it is not Data. I cannot explain. I believe he has taken Alexander. Now, isn't that a shame? Poor Sheriff's been injured. What's the matter? Was my pa too rough on you? Data! What? Why is the computer creating characters that look like Data? Where have they taken my son? Where is he? Temper, temper, Sheriff. My pa ain't gonna like it if I come home all bruised. Worf, wait. We have to remember, even though the safeguards are off, this is still a program. If we can get to the end of this story as it was designed, the program will automatically terminate. You are right. I will begin by speaking to the people of this town. Perhaps somebody witnessed Alexander's abduction. Captain's log, supplemental. La Forge and Data have found the cause of the mysterious malfunctions which have been plaguing the ship. We think our experiment caused one of the subroutines to be altered. When the malfunction occurred, subroutine C-47 was replaced by elements from my programming. What does C-47 control? Library-computer access, replicator selection, recreation, no critical systems. That would explain why your program began playing the Slavonic Dances. I have been analyzing the works of Antonín Dvořák. It's the same with the play and the food replicators. The replicators on decks four to nine are producing nothing but cat food. Cat food? Nutritional supplements for Spot. When can you correct it? We are attempting to isolate the corrupt circuit pathways. I reckon the process should take two hours. What did you say? The process should take two hours. No. You said, ""I reckon"". According to my memory logs, I did not. Y'all must be mistaken. Data, you did it again. Did what? Mr. La Forge, take Mr. Data to Engineering to find the problem. Aye, sir. Can I help you with something? I spoke to several witnesses who saw Alexander being abducted by one of Hollander's men. We must begin a systematic search of the town. We've got another problem. I saw Eli playing cards, shuffling the way Data does. He doesn't just look like Data, he has Data's abilities. Which means his father probably does, also. I've come to see my boy. Remove your weapon. Better take a good look at that gun. You might see it again soon. Pa. Eli. How are they treating you? Real bad. They ain't fed me since I got here. That Sheriff's been roughing up on me something fierce. Don't you worry, boy. The Sheriff's gonna pay. Who's the stranger? I don't know. She ain't said her name. But she's in cahoots with the Sheriff, and she's mighty mean with that Winchester. You sit tight, boy. I'll have you home in time for supper. I'm gonna give you one more opportunity, Sheriff, to avoid a ugly situation. Release my boy. I have reconsidered your offer. I will release your son in exchange for my deputy. I thought you might have a change of heart. Meet me in two hours. You be in front of the saloon. I'll be in front of the livery stable. Strangers ain't invited. Agreed. In every Western I've ever read, the villains break their word. He can't be trusted. We made an honourable agreement. They're not concerned with honour. This is the Ancient West. There's a gunfighter with the speed and accuracy of an android. In two hours, he'll try to kill you. Mr. Data? Howdy, Commander. Geordi, what have you found? Well, we figure part of my memory structure was replaced with information from the recreational database. Specifically, files relating to the American 19th-century West. That would explain the accent. You got it, partner. This is a result of the interface? I'm afraid so. We've initiated a memory purge to restore Data's programming. He should be normal in two hours. And the recreational database? We started a memory purge there, too. Another hour, maybe two. Commander. You just sit tight. We'll have this fixed up in time for supper. Good. I will be at this end of the street. Frank Hollander will approach from this end. At this point, he will be within range. Understood. What about Alexander? There's a rain barrel here. It should stop the bullets. You would not believe what I went through to get old man Newsom to give up his telegraph machine. Excellent. Lord knows why I keep risking my life for you, Sheriff. Yes. Thank you, Miss Annie. I'm in your debt. I have connected the communicator's energy cell to serve as the power source. How long will the field last? No more than 15 seconds. It is highly unstable. Let's hope it's enough. Eli, get down. Alexander. Don't even think about it. Seňor Frank. Go ahead. Shoot me. Do not show your face in this town again. Let's go. Father. Are you alright? Yes. End program. I don't understand this. The story should be over. What's left? Computer, end program. Sheriff! You're as handy with a shooting iron... ..as you are with a woman's heart. Computer, end program. Computer, now! Captain's log, stardate 46278.3. Both Cmdr Data and the computer have been restored to normal operation. Our rendezvous with the ship Biko has proceeded as planned. Father? After what happened, I guess you'll never want to go back to the Ancient West. The town of Deadwood may face danger once again. If they do, they will need a sheriff. And a deputy. (ENGLISH) "
S6E09,"Commander, is it your intention to continue to grow your beard? Actually, I'm not sure yet. Why, Worf? I was just asking. Seven-card stud, one-eyed Jacks are wild. Frankly, Geordi, I like the beard. Thank you, Commander. You know, I have always been a little suspicious of men in beards. Why is that? It's like they're hiding something. Hide? Don't be ridiculous. The beard is an ancient and proud tradition. Many distinguished men have worn beards. After the razor was invented, beards became mostly a fashion statement. I'm not concerned with fashion. To a Klingon, a beard is a symbol of courage. I think it's a sign of strength. Sure, and of course, women can't grow beards. It sounds like you think beards are an affectation. I do. But there's nothing wrong with that. Women wear make-up and nail polish. I just think it's time that you men admit it. My beard is not an affectation. Then you wouldn't mind shaving it off. In a minute. I've just gotten used to it. OK, then why don't we up the stakes a little? And if I win, all of you shave your beards off. Wait a minute, what if you lose? What are you gonna give up? I'm open for suggestions. I'd like to see you as a brunette. I did that at 13. I couldn't change back fast enough. That makes me even more curious! Fine. If one of you wins, I'll become a brunette. Are we on? Yeah, we'll take that bet. Looks like you have the hand to beat, Commander. 200. I'm in 200. Geordi. This is the Captain. We've arrived at the Tyran system. Senior staff to the bridge. Wait! Sorry. Duty calls. We'll have to do this some other time. Captain's log, stardate 46307.2. We have just come into orbit of Tyrus VIIA to monitor progress on the Tyran particle fountain, a radically new mining technology. The project has been fraught with problems and is well behind schedule. Mr. La Forge has been assigned to evaluate the situation. Dr Farallon, the plans call for the particle fountain to lift 500 kg per minute from the surface. So far, we haven't come close to that. I want to increase the stream density. That should boost capacity by 72 percent. You'll be overloading the field generators in the process. Not if we distribute the overload evenly. Maybe we should complete this phase before we talk about redesigning it! Commander, I know you're here to evaluate this project. Starfleet may use a particle fountain on Carema III. They want to know if it's feasible. Will your opinion decide that? No. I'll report to Capt Picard. He'll make the recommendation to Starfleet. They'll decide. What's your feeling? The question we should be asking is, is this technology more efficient than conventional mining techniques? Commander, I know we've had problems. It seems like nothing's gone right. It's taking longer than I thought to get the stream to full strength. But I know it can work. This is the direction of mining in the future, and it should be implemented on Carema III. I know this can be potentially very exciting... Alright. I want to show you something I've been working on. It might help us complete this project. I've used these on a limited basis... Enterprise to Cmdr La Forge. I am reading power fluctuations from the station core. Please report. We have a malfunction in one of the power grids. We're losing particle-stream confinement. Do you require assistance? Stand by. We'll have to shut it down. It took four months to get the flux to this level. If we shut it down, it'll take four months to get it back. In five minutes, we lose containment. The stream will flood the station. We'll have to shut it down anyway. We'll have to fix the power grid. But how do we do that? The defective grid is 200 meters down conduit A-2, and through four bulkheads. Here's the perfect opportunity to show you what I had in mind. What is this? This is an exocomp, the experiment I was telling you about. If it fails, we'll still have time to shut down the fountain. Enterprise to La Forge. What is your situation? No change. We're working on it. If this doesn't work soon, we'll have to shut down. The confinement field is at full strength. Particle flux steady. All power levels are back to normal. Please report. We're fine, Data. The power grid is fully restored. The malfunction seems to be repaired and operations here at the station are back to normal. How did you accomplish the repairs so quickly? You know, I'm not exactly sure. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 46315.2. Repairs to the particle fountain seem to have succeeded and it is now functioning smoothly. Dr Farallon is to demonstrate the device that carried out repairs. Energize. Aye, sir. Welcome to the Enterprise, Doctor. I am Lt Cmdr Data. Mr. Data, I was hoping I'd have a chance to meet you. I've done studies of your positronic network. And I have studied your fountain. I find the concept innovative. Thank you. I am curious how you were able to repair the power grid so quickly. This should make it clear. Let's set it up in Engineering. Is it true your computational speed is limited only by the separation of your positronic links? That is no longer the case. I recently converted my sequencer to asynchronous operation, removing the constraint. Doctor. This way, please. But how did you resolve the signal fragmentation? The sequencer is now bi-directional, compensating for mode distortion arising from the resonant field. Yes. That's fascinating. Does it require any buffering system to eliminate interference? We've been using devices like this on Tyrus VII for years. The basic unit is a common industrial servomechanism. A few years ago, I started tinkering with one. This is the result. Boridium power converter. Axionic chip network! Very impressive. In terms of computational speed, this guy might compete with Data. The exocomps don't come close to Data's sophistication. Exocomps? That's what I call them. Let's say you had an antimatter- flow converter that was fluctuating. How would you repair it? By adjusting the converter. With what? A mode stabilizer. OK. Let me input the problem into the exocomp. A fluctuating antimatter-flow converter. Now, let's see what happens. A mode stabilizer. Very nice. You have incorporated a microreplication system, in order to fashion tools. It's more than that. I designed the exocomps to be problem solvers. When they perform a task they've never done before, the microreplicator creates new circuit pathways in its memory. So in a sense, they are learning. Exactly. The more situations they encounter, the more circuit pathways they build. They become better tools as they work. It's very impressive technology, for sure. After the experimental stage, it'll be useful. Commander, I'm hoping the experimental stage is over. When are we supposed to brief Capt Picard on the fountain? 1600 hours. Good. I'll have a proposal to make. I know you should give your evaluation to Starfleet today. I'd like you to postpone the report for 48 hours. We leave tomorrow. To change that plan, I need a very good reason. I realize that, sir. If you're going to report to Starfleet about using the particle fountain on Carema, it's only fair you see it operating at full strength. Agreed. I think I can complete the project and boost the stream's efficiency if I use exocomps, the new devices I've constructed. I understand one of these devices repaired a faulty power grid. Yes, sir. I've been testing them on a limited basis. But I think they're ready to be used on a larger scale. Mr. La Forge, your thoughts? Well, I guess the only risk is in falling further behind. I'm willing to take that risk. Mr. Data? Exocomps are highly sophisticated devices. If they perform well, their potential for this project is considerable. I'm inclined to agree. I don't think 48 hours is too much time to risk when the gains are so substantial. You may proceed, Doctor. Thank you, sir. If possible, I'd like Cmdr Data to work with me. Thank you, Doctor. I welcome the opportunity. Commander, there's a plasma conduit in one of the tunnels ready to be sealed. The perfect job for an exocomp. I agree, Doctor. Well, Mr. Data, what is your analysis so far? I have completed 14 separate tasks with this exocomp in the past hour. I estimate it would take two people nine hours to complete those tasks. I characterize the unit's performance as excellent. I hope Cmdr La Forge and Capt Picard agree. I am confident they will. Cmdr La Forge is especially... It didn't finish sealing the plasma conduit. Let me send it back in. It is not accepting your commands. Maybe there's a malfunction in the control processor. Let me see if I can override it. Doctor? I'm alright. The control pad just overloaded. What's the matter with this thing? Second Officer's log, stardate 46315.5. The behaviour of the ex ocomp has puzzled Dr Farallon and myself. We have brought the defective unit to the Enterprise for investigation. The exocomp came out of the plasma conduit. We tried to override and send it back but it shut down. It's been unresponsive ever since. Well, let's see what our computer has to say. The circuitry which links the exocomp to the control pad is burned out. That's strange. Any indication of secondary power surges? No. But what's going on there? Data, increase the magnification of section Gamma four. Interesting. The number of new circuit pathways has increased by 632 percent. No. What is it? Sometimes an exocomp forms large numbers of new pathways at random, until it reaches a point where it shuts down, just like this one. Doctor, the new pathways do not interfere with the original circuitry. Once the exocomp is corrupted, it's useless. You have to erase the unit and start again, and there's no time for that now. That leaves just two. It's gonna slow you down. Yes, you have the right to point out you told me so. I only wanted to say we'd add on an extra shift to pick up the slack. I'm sorry. I guess I'm touchy these days. It's OK. You've got a lot on your shoulders. Well, I'd better get back to it. Thanks, Commander. Data. I feel sorry for her. This project has had nothing but problems. Why did that plasma conduit explode? There was a micro-fracture in the conduit wall. The fault did not show on our instruments. It's a good thing the exocomp malfunctioned. Almost seems like it knew just when to leave. Geordi, are you implying the exocomp exhibited some form of self-preservation? Of course not. Lt Pierson to Cmdr La Forge. Can you join us in the systems monitor room? On my way. Computer, run a level-one diagnostic of the exocomp's command module. The command pathways are functioning normally. How can that be, if the interface circuitry is burned out? The interface circuitry has been repaired. Curious. Computer, access the exocomp's sensor logs. Confirm there was a failure in the circuitry in the last 12 hours. Confirmed. Interface failure occurred at 1150 hours today when the ex ocomp produced a power surge which burned out the linkage. How and when was it repaired? The ex ocomp activated a self-repair program at 1340 hours. Why would the exocomp burn out its own interface circuitry and repair it two hours later? Unknown. Here you are. I thought you'd be hard at work by now. I wanted a quiet cup of tea before I went back. Gathering strength. I've assigned two teams to work on the particle fountain. Thank you, Commander. I'm grateful. You know, I want you to know that I do admire the work that you've done. I'm sorry the exocomps aren't working out. You were right. I'm trying to move too fast. I lack that conservative streak most scientists have. I always seem to be out on the edge, taking chances. I bet, as a girl, you always climbed one branch higher than other kids. Anything to get to the top of the tree. And I bet you never fell. No. I fell all the time, usually breaking a bone in the process. I just never let it stop me. If it's down to sheer determination, you'll get this fountain built. You're right about that, Commander. I've spent six years of my life on this project. It's the first thought I have when I wake up and the last before I go to bed. Whatever it takes to prove this technology, I'll do. Doctor, if you wish to master the bat'leth sword, you must learn to strike and avoid in the same motion. I almost got in under your guard, Worf. Almost. Well, I'll keep that in mind next lesson. Doctor... Are you injured? Only my pride, Data. Thanks. Doctor, what is the definition of life? That is a big question. Why do you ask? I am searching for a definition so I can test a hypothesis. Well, the broadest scientific definition might be that life is what enables plants and animals to consume food, derive energy from it, grow, adapt to surroundings and reproduce. Anything exhibiting these characteristics is alive? In general, yes. What about fire? Fire? Yes. It consumes fuel to produce energy, it grows, it creates offspring. By your definition, is it alive? Fire is a chemical reaction. The same applies to growing crystals. But we don't consider them alive. And what about me? I do not grow. I do not reproduce. Yet I am considered to be alive. That's true, but you are unique. I wonder if that is so. Data, if I may ask... Have a seat. What exactly are you getting at? I am curious as to what transpired between the moment when I was an assemblage of parts in Dr Soong's laboratory and the next moment when I became alive. What is it that endowed me with life? Wesley asked me a similar question when he was little. I tried to give an answer, but everything I said sounded inadequate. But scientists and philosophers have grappled with that question for centuries, without reaching a conclusion. Are you saying the question cannot be answered? No. I think I'm saying that we struggle all our lives to answer it, but it's the struggle that is important. That's what helps us define our place in the universe. I believe I understand. I don't think I've been much help. On the contrary, you have been a great deal of help. Thank you. Murphy's team will cover gamma shift from 2300 to 0700 hours. OK, I've split the Engineering teams among the shifts. If nothing else goes wrong, you should finish on time. With the help of the exocomps, I think we will. Think they'll toe the line? Don't worry. They know who's in charge. Doctor, I must ask you to stop using the exocomps. Why? Is something wrong with them? No, it is not that. I have reason to believe the exocomps are alive. Captain's log, stardate 46316.6. I've summoned the senior staff to discuss Cmdr Data's theory that the ex ocomps are a life form. Dr Farallon has attended only reluctantly. I object to being called here. My time can be better spent elsewhere. Doctor, I appreciate your time constraints, but recognizing new life, whatever its form, is the principal mission of this vessel. Please. Now, Mr. Data, will you tell us what makes you think that the exocomps are alive? Sir, when the exocomp left the tunnel prior to the explosion it may have been attempting to save itself. Do you have any basis for that? Yes. When you tried to send the exocomp back in the tunnel, it deliberately burned out its control interface. Deliberately? The computer diagnostics show the exocomp disabled its interface. That could have been a malfunction. However, two hours later, when no longer in danger, it repaired itself. I believe the exocomp was protecting itself. If so, it demonstrated an awareness of its environment and an ability to adapt to it. You're anthropomorphising these units. Like any mechanical devices, they can malfunction. One time, I saw an exocomp enter a reaction chamber and vaporize itself. Should I think it was depressed and suicidal? Why is it so difficult to accept that the exocomp could be alive? You're talking to a living machine now. I have nothing but respect and admiration for Dr Soong's accomplishment. But his intention was to create an artificial life form. I created the exocomps to be tools. And there's a big difference between Data and a tool. Doctor, there is a big difference between you and a virus, but both are alive. If the possibility exists, no matter how slight, that the exocomps are life forms, we must examine that possibility. Thank you, sir. And until we have a definitive answer, I believe it is inappropriate to exploit them as labourers. That's absurd! If they are intelligent life forms, we have no right to force them to work. That's like me saying don't use your tricorder. Tricorders aren't alive. Neither are exocomps. Clearly these are difficult issues to resolve. We have to proceed very carefully. So the first task is to test Mr. Data's hypothesis. You're claiming this exocomp demonstrated survival instincts? Yes. Then why don't we threaten its survival again and see what happens? Make it so. Doctor, we're pretty much ready here. You can begin programming it. We've recreated a situation similar to the one in the plasma conduit. We have created a small conduit breach in this tube. The exocomp would normally take several minutes for such a repair. But in the tube, it will find a plasma-cascade failure in progress. I assume this is a simulation. Yes, sir. An overload signal will simulate a failure in one minute. If it does possess a survival instinct, as Mr. Data claims, it will exit the tube before the minute is up, to save itself. Very well, proceed. OK. Beginning test program now. One minute. 50 seconds. 30 seconds. 10 seconds. Five, four, three, two, one. That's it. If this had been for real, that conduit would have exploded with the exocomp inside. Go ahead, bring it back in. I think we've spent more than enough time answering this question. I hope the outcome wasn't too disappointing, Mr. Data. It was no surprise to me. Thank you for your help. You're welcome. Well, I consider it time well spent. As do l, sir. Thank you. 30 seconds. 20 seconds. Cmdr Riker said you'd still be down here. He also said the exocomp failed the test. That is true. Time expired. Test complete. I completed 34 more tests. The results were the same in each. Perhaps I was wrong in suspecting the exocomp was alive. This was really important to you, wasn't it? You said earlier that I am unique. If so, then I am alone in the universe. When I began investigating the exocomps, I realized I might be encountering a progenitor of myself. Suddenly the possibility exists that I am no longer alone. For that reason, I... The exocomp has returned. Wasn't it supposed to do that? In the previous 34 trials, I brought it back after the simulated failure. This time, I neglected to do that. I distracted you. Sorry. Do not apologize. We made a significant discovery. What? It has replicated a different tool. That is not the molecular fuser it had on entering the tube. Doctor, the exocomp not only completed the repairs, it also deactivated the overload signal. I thought this was just a simulation. It was, and the exocomp must have realized that. It saw that there was no real danger and completed the repairs. And replicated the correct tool to eliminate the false signal. I see no other possible explanation. The exocomp didn't fail the test, it saw right through it. Captain's log, stardate 46317.8. At Dr Farallon's request, I have agreed to tour the station and assess the situation personally. I must decide soon if it is in Starfleet's best interest to recommend the particle fountain as a reliable technology. We're making progress, Captain. We may not be at full capacity within the deadline, but we'll be close. There's still difficulty with the phase selectors. True, but I'm sure it's the last real problem. I hope so, for the sake of the project. I understand, sir. We'll do our best. This is strange. Primary power is still on line. A power-grid malfunction? I don't think so. Something's drawing power into the particle impeller. That's not a good sign. It may mean... We've lost internal confinement. The particle stream is surging. Radiation will flood this chamber. We've got to get everyone out. The station must be evacuated. Captain... That is an order! Assemble your personnel on the transporter now! Picard to Enterprise. Do you read me? Riker here, sir. Radiation field is increasing. We are losing communications. Prepare for emergency transport. Red alert. Transporter room two, prepare for emergency transport. Radiation is setting up an ionization effect. We've got less than a minute. Is that everybody? Where's Takenta? He was near the impeller control. I'll get him. Takenta! Mr. La Forge! Stand by to transport. Captain, you'll be trapped here! Mr. La Forge! Are you alright? I'm fine, Captain. I only caught the edge of it. He's dead. Do you have them? They're here, sir. Is everyone alright? We're fine, sir. But Capt Picard, Cmdr La Forge and one of my men are still there. Kelso, can you get them off? I'm trying, sir. I can't establish a pattern lock. We barely managed to transport off. The field ionization is too intense. Commander, the particle fountain is continuing to surge. The radiation in the core will reach fatal levels in 23 minutes. If I can access the field emitters, we could establish a force field. Try to link your console to my command-system subroutine. Alright. Link established. OK, here we go. I'm reading fluctuations. The field is not stable. Radiation is too high. The emitters are deteriorating. How long will it last? Not very long. Cmdr Riker has to get to us. Maybe we can help him out. Try to access the emergency shutdown. I'll try to activate the ionic dampers. A force field was just activated on the station. Cmdr La Forge may have established a low-intensity deflector field. It won't last long in that radiation. No, sir. My readings indicate it will fail in 22 minutes. OK, we've got 22 minutes. I want some options. Can we send a shuttlecraft? We'd never get there in time. We must shut down the particle fountain. If we detonate a torpedo within the particle stream, would that shut it down? We must configure it carefully. The shape of the shock wave is critical, but it could work. How long would it take to set up? It would take a minimum of 65 minutes to configure the torpedo. We don't have that kind of time. Maybe the exocomps can help us. I can program their power cells to explode on command. They can be configured just like a photon torpedo in a few minutes. I must object to that plan. We've been through this. We tested the exocomp and it failed. Dr Crusher and I discovered the exocomp did not fail the test. It is still my belief that it is a new life form. You know I respect your judgement. But I can't risk the Captain and Geordi on the basis of your belief. Prepare the exocomp, Doctor. If I am correct the exocomps will not allow themselves to be destroyed. They have a sense of survival. They will shut down rather than comply. I could disconnect their command pathways before I program them. Do it. Cmdr Riker, we're ready. Target 200 meters below the apex of the particle stream. Feed the coordinates to transporter room two. Aye, sir. Coordinates received. Mr. Kelso. Energize. Mr. Kelso? Sorry, sir. The transporter system just went dead. Some kind of malfunction. Run a diagnostic. Try bypassing... Commander, that will not be necessary. The transporter is not malfunctioning. I have locked out the controls. I gave you a direct order. Release that transporter lockout now! I cannot do that, sir. If you don't, I will relieve you of duty. That is your prerogative. Under Starfleet regulations, insubordination is a court-martial offence. But I will not release the transporter. Those are two of your friends out there. They have saved your life many times. I can't believe you'd sacrifice them. Commander, do not think this is an arbitrary decision. I have considered the ramifications of my actions. It is not justified to sacrifice one life form for another. You don't know the exocomps are life forms. True. I am acting on personal beliefs, but I do not see I can do otherwise. You're risking a lot on the basis of a belief. I have observed humans often base their judgements on instinct or intuition. As I am a machine, I lack that particular ability. But I may have insight into other machines that humans lack. If I could save the Captain and Geordi without destroying the exocomps, I would, but this is the only solution. Then let me offer an alternative. Transport me to the station. I will attempt a manual shutdown. The radiation levels are too high, even for you. Your positronic net would ionize in no time. I can't let you sacrifice yourself. Commander, if I give my life for my fellow officers, that is my choice. The exocomps no longer have a choice. What if we reconnect their command pathways and give them a choice? You assume the exocomps would shut down before accepting this mission. What if we ask them if they are willing to proceed? That sounds reasonable, sir. If they choose to go, I will release the transporter lockout. Fair enough. Alright. I've enabled their command pathways. If they do not shut down after I have programmed them, we may assume they are willing to go. Are they willing or not? They haven't shut down. They seem to be reprogramming the commands I entered. Reprogramming them? They are unwilling to be transported for detonation. But they may have another solution. That we haven't considered? Do they have superior intelligence? No, Doctor, but they do have superior experience. The exocomps have interfaced with every part of the station core, something none of us has done, including you. They may have another way to control the particle surge. Those appear to be power taps. Sir, new coordinates are being fed to the transporter by the exocomps. The coordinates are inside the station core. Kelso, energize. Aye, sir. Mr. La Forge. What are they up to? The exocomps are siphoning power from the core. They're distorting the stream. That might open up a window to beam us out. If they can modulate the radiation field, it'll work. but they have to get the subharmonic frequencies to resonance. The particle-stream frequency is beginning to fluctuate. They're having difficulty controlling the feedback. Can we help them? Modulate the power transfer? No, sir, we've done all we can do. It's up to them now. They're beginning to balance the power-absorption rates. It's working. The particle stream is beginning to distort. Almost at resonance. They've got it. Drop the force field. Commander, I've got a pattern lock. Energize. Can you lock on to the exocomps? I'm trying, sir. I'm sorry, I was only able to lock on to two of them. I couldn't fix a signal on the other one. One of them had to continue disrupting the particle stream. That could prevent a signal lock. It was the only way to save the other two. I must admit you've given me a lot to think about, Cmdr Data. I don't exactly know what the exocomps are, but be assured, until I do, I won't be treating them as simple tools. Thank you. I wish your particle fountain had been more successful. Maybe the exocomps will help you reconstruct it. I hope they will. And I predict that in a year or two, you will be able to recommend the technology to Starfleet. I look forward to it. Doctor. Something more, Mr. Data? Yes, sir. You might want to know why I was willing to risk your life for several small machines. I think I understand. It could not have been an easy choice. No, sir, it was not. When my own status as a living being was in question, you fought to protect my rights. I will always be grateful. The exocomps had no such advocate. If I had not acted on their behalf, they would have been destroyed. I could not allow that to happen. Of course you couldn't. It was the most human decision you've ever made. (ENGLISH) "
S6E10,"Captain's log, stardate 46357.4. We have rendezvoused with the Starship Cairo, near the Cardassian border for an urgent meeting with Vice Admiral Necheyev. Come! Capt Jean-Luc Picard. Admiral, welcome aboard. Thank you. That'll be all, Commander. Coffee? Tea? Thank you, no. I'm afraid there's no time for pleasantries. I'm here to relieve you of command of the Enterprise. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. The Cardassian forces recently withdrawn from the Bajoran Sector have been redeployed along the Federation border. They have mobilized three divisions and increased subspace communications by 50 percent. They may be preparing for an incursion into Federation space. Are the Cardassians ready for a war? I didn't say war. I said incursion. Intelligence reports suggest they'll try to seize a disputed system on the border. They may be gambling that we won't go to war over one system. Will we? I hope we won't need to make that decision. The Enterprise is to meet the Cardassian representative for talks. We hope the presence of the Federation flagship on the border will send a message about how seriously we view this. Where's Capt Picard? The Captain, Chief Medical Officer and Security Chief have been reassigned. That's all I can tell you. Do you know Edward Jellico? He's in command of the Cairo. I've heard of him. I don't know... I'm giving him command of the Enterprise. Capt Jellico helped negotiate the original armistice two years ago. I believe he is the most qualified person to lead this mission. The change of command will take place at 1300. Thank you. Admiral, with all due respect, Capt Jellico needn't be given command just to conduct a negotiation. I disagree. The Enterprise will be in a dangerous situation. I want someone who has a lot of experience with the Cardassians. No offence, Commander, but that's not you. Halt! Computer, freeze program. You were five seconds slower that time. You increased the difficulty, sir. It'll be more difficult where we're going. Which is where exactly? I'm sorry, I can't tell you yet. It would help to know about our mission. Mr. Worf, I have my orders. I'm sure you understand. Doctor, this deflector wasn't set properly. The emitter ray must block the entire passage, or it's useless. Sorry, I was busy escaping from that Cardassian, or maybe it was the falling rocks. I understand this is difficult. I can only ask you to trust me. Alright, let's do it again. Mr. Worf, time the Doctor and me through that first tunnel. And this time, we're going to pick up those five seconds. Welcome aboard, sir. I'm... William T Riker, class of '57. I look forward to serving with you. And I you. I'm sure this change has taken everybody by surprise. Well, yes, sir. It surprised me, too. I admit I miss the Cairo already. But a Galaxy-class ship, that's something special. I see why you turned down a command to stay aboard. Yes, sir. How many duty watches do we stand? A standard three shifts. I'd like to change to four, starting tonight. I also want to examine duty rosters and crew evaluations right away. I want readiness reports from department heads by 1400 and a meeting of the senior staff at 1500. Do you prefer Will or William? Will, sir. Where are my quarters, Will? Cabin 735, deck... Deck seven. I'll see you at 1300 hours. Yeah, I know. Wearing these uniforms reminds me of my first days at the Academy. Attention to orders! ""To Capt Jean-Luc Picard, Commanding Officer USS Enterprise, stardate 46358.1 ."" ""You are requested and required to relinquish command to Capt Edward Jellico, Commanding Officer, USS Cairo, as of this date. Signed, Vice Admiral Alynna Necheyev. Starfleet Command."" Computer, transfer all command codes to Capt Jellico. Voice authorization, Picard, Delta five. Transfer complete. USS Enterprise now under command of Capt Edward Jellico. I relieve you, sir. I stand relieved. Dismissed. I wonder how permanent this is gonna be. I don't know. They don't usually go through the ceremony if it's just temporary. Sore? Sore doesn't begin to describe it! I know. I wish I could talk about it. Most systems were changed at the last overhaul. They won't be a problem. But you might check the port... I'll take care of the Enterprise, Jean-Luc. You don't have to mother me. How's your team shaping up? Very well. But I would prefer more recent intelligence on the exact layout of the installation. Our most current information is two years old. Two years? I don't know how Necheyev talked you into this. She gave me no choice. Well, maybe there's something we can do to help. We'll launch a class-five probe just before we reach the border. You could pick up the telemetry aboard the shuttle. Now that would be extremely helpful. Will. Captain. Captain. We're scheduled to arrive at the Cardassian border during Delta shift. Inform the Tactical Officer I want to launch a class-five probe just before we drop out of warp. I wanted to talk about Delta shift. Right now, Gamma shift will be on duty on arrival. I'll inform them. Is there a problem with Delta shift, Will? There is no Delta shift yet, sir. I've spoken to department heads about changing to four shifts and they assure me it'll cause major personnel problems. So you have not changed the watch rotation? I was going to explain after the ceremony, sir. Tell the department heads that, as of now, the Enterprise is on a four-shift rotation. I don't want to talk about it. Get it done. Now, that means Delta shift will be due to come on duty in two hours. I expect you to have it fully manned and ready when it does. Is that clear? Yes, sir. If you'll excuse me, sir. Captain. He was your first officer for five years. One of the finest officers that I have ever served with. Of course he is, Jean-Luc. I'm sure it'll all work out. Captain's log, stardate 46358.2. We are on course for a rendezvous with the Cardassian ship, Reklar. Fortunately, I still have time to prepare the crew for the task ahead. We need a bypass between the phaser array and the secondary generators. Run the main deflector path through the warp-power grid and the conduits through the lateral relays. You may have to reconfigure the interface. Sir, the interface was not designed for that. It will take seven hours. Sir, our interface already routes auxiliary power through three relays. I'm aware of your current design. It's not good enough. If the talks fail, we'll be at war. I want to be loaded for bear! I'll get on it. Good. These stations should be devoted to damage control and weapons status. See they are manned at all times. Aye, sir. Mr. Data, how long before we reach the rendezvous? We will arrive in 5 1 hours, 32 minutes, sir. Schedule four battle drills, one for each shift. Run a series of simulated attacks from a Cardassian squadron. I want you to conduct the exercises personally, Will. Get it done. Get that fish out of the ready room. Data, you're with me. Power transfer must be upgraded by 20 percent. Warp-coil efficiency is also poor. It's well within specifications. I'm not interested in the specs. The efficiency must rise by 15 percent. 15 percent! That is an attainable goal. We will have to realign the warp coil and take the secondary grid off line. Very good. That's exactly what I want you to do. To take this grid off line, we'll have to shut down the labs and geological research. We're not on a research mission. Get it done in two days. I believe that is also attainable. If we utilize the entire department, there should be sufficient manpower to do it. Sure, if nobody sleeps for two days! Then you'd better get to it, Geordi. You have some work to do. Data. Yes? May I speak with you, Captain? Deanna. Come in. The latest masterpieces from my son. It's an elephant. I think. Definitely an elephant. I'm glad you're here. I'd like to go over the duty roster with you. I'd be happy to. But first, I'd like to talk about how the change in Command is affecting the crew. I've noticed some resistance. I wouldn't call it resistance. More like uncertainty. Most of them had served under Capt Picard for several years. They knew him and they knew what he expected. Now they're being asked to adjust to a new captain and a new way of doing things. And they're uncertain how to react. I see your point. This can be very unsettling to them. And to you. Perhaps everyone just needs time. Time for you to get to know and trust the crew, and time for them to understand how you want things done. I'm glad you brought this to my attention, Deanna. Unfortunately, I don't have time for a honeymoon with the crew. You've clearly given this a lot of thought. I'd like you to take charge of the morale situation. Please see to it that they make the adjustment quickly and easily. I have a meeting with the new security chief in five minutes. The duty roster will have to wait. Thank you, Counsellor. By the way, ... ..I prefer a certain formality on the bridge. I'd appreciate it if you wore standard uniform while on duty. Of course, sir. He's asked me to re-route half the power systems, change duty rosters, realign the warp coils, and he's moved a third of my crew to Security. You're not alone. He's made major changes in every department on board. I don't mind changes or hard work, but the man isn't giving me time! Someone must make him see reason. It won't be me. He's made that clear. Then can I make a suggestion? Talk to Capt Picard. Maybe he can do something. We just need time. Alright. Come! Are you alright, sir? Yes, I am. But the last time I had to train like this was for the Academy marathon. But I'm managing. What can I do for you? It's nothing urgent. I'm sorry I bothered you. Goodnight. I am to maintain radio silence until the mission's complete. Well, we'll monitor your channel in case you do need to transmit. Bridge to Captain. We're at the shuttle departure coordinates. Did you launch the probe? Yes, sir. I wasn't aware you wanted to be informed. Thank you. Jellico out. I can see why he's still only a first officer. Captain, I would just like you to know that Cmdr Riker... I've read your reports, Jean-Luc. I know you think highly of him. Not just me. He's been decorated by Starfleet Command five times. He's been offered his own ship more than once. I think if you just gave him a chance, you'd find him outstanding. Jean-Luc, let's be candid for a moment. The Cardassians won't listen to reason and the Federation won't give in to their demands. And the chances are you won't be coming back from this mission. I want this ship ready for action and I don't have time to give Will Riker or anyone else a chance. And forgive me for being blunt, but the Enterprise is mine now. Well, here's hoping you beat the odds. Good hunting. Thank you. Jean-Luc. I believe this is yours. Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. We have cleared the shuttle bay. Acknowledged. Good luck. Thank you, Enterprise. Well, now that we're under way, I can tell you about our mission. Starfleet Intelligence believes that the Cardassians are developing a metagenic weapon. Oh, my God! I am not familiar with metagenics. Genetically engineered viruses designed to destroy whole ecosystems. When metagenic toxins enter an atmosphere, they mutate and seek out and destroy all forms of DNA they encounter. In a few days, everything is dead. In a month, the agent breaks down and dissipates completely, leaving every city, every road, every piece of equipment perfectly intact. Leaving the planet safe to be conquered. Wouldn't using such a weapon pose as great a risk to the attacker? That's why biological weapons were outlawed years ago. Even the Romulans abide by the agreements. Starfleet Intelligence believes the Cardassians are developing a new delivery system, one that would protect them from accidental exposure. They believe the Cardassians are testing a way of launching dormant metagenic material on a subspace carrier wave. So they could activate the toxins after the launch, avoiding exposure. Because the subspace wave would appear as background radiation, no one would realize what was happening till it was too late. Now, for the past few weeks, theta-band subspace emissions have been detected from Celtris III. These may indicate that a metagenic delivery system is in operation. What do we know about Celtris III? Very little. It was thought uninhabited until these emissions began. Starfleet believes the Cardassians may have a secret research lab somewhere below the planet's surface. Our orders are to penetrate this installation and determine if the Cardassians are building a metagenic weapon. And if they are? Destroy it. At any cost. When I was on the Stargazer, we tested theta-band carrier waves. I'm here because of my familiarity with methods of generating them. Mr. Worf, your presence is obvious. Doctor, your job will be to locate and destroy any biotoxins we find. Celtris III is in Cardassian space. How will we get there undetected? I know a way of acquiring some discreet transport. Mr. Worf, set a course for Torman V. If he doesn't pay up, I know three large Ferengi who will not be so forgiving. I didn't do it! I'm not accusing you of anything. What do you want, then? We're looking for DaiMon Solok. Why? We have a business proposition to discuss. Solok is a very busy, very important man. He isn't here. But I could relay a message. Good. Please will you tell DaiMon Solok that we are interested in transportation to Celtris III. That's a Cardassian planet. Now, we understand that DaiMon Solok runs cargo there from time to time. Solok is no smuggler! Yes, but if Solok were to go to Celtris III, for legitimate reasons, we would be interested in quietly booking passage for the journey. I don't think he would be interested in dealing with Federation spies! You know, ... ..I heard that Solok was quite a man. Well, yes! He is an extraordinary man! That's why we came here, because only Solok could help us. I guess there's some things even Solok can't do. It's too bad. Because if he could, ... ..I would be very, very... Yes? ..grateful. When do you want to leave? Beverly, make sure your tricorder keeps a precise map of the route. We could easily get lost in here. Right. I'm picking up some subspace signals, but I can't seem to get a lock on them. That's typical of theta-band emissions. We have to compress the detection bandwidth to determine the fix. The source emission is 500 meters east of here. And 700 meters below. It's alright. They're called lynars, a kind of Celtrine bat. They're harmless. Bats! You're not afraid of bats, are you Worf? Of course not! First Officer's log, supplemental. We've rendezvoused with the Reklar to begin diplomatic talks designed to ease tension along the border. Gul Lemec is in the observation lounge. Very good. I'll be in my ready room. Yes? I think there's been a slight miscommunication. Did you want to meet with Gul Lemec in here? No, the observation lounge is appropriate. I see. Lemec is a Cardassian, and Cardassians are like timber wolves, predators, bold in large numbers, cautious by themselves, and with an instinctive need to establish a dominant position in any social gathering. So you're establishing a dominant position by making him wait for you? The trouble with wolves is that sometimes in the fight for dominance, one of them ends up dead. In that case, the trick is... ..to be the wolf that's still standing at the end. The floor is over 500 meters down. There doesn't seem to be a way round. We'll have to rappel from here. This is sheer granite. We'll have to use fusing pitons. We could try to find another way down. That would take several hours. We don't have the time. Not afraid of heights, are you? Of course not. Remember to control your descent. And don't get the lines tangled. I'll remember! Alright? I've been waiting for over an hour... I'm Capt Jellico. You know Cmdr Riker. This is Lt Cmdr Troi. Let's get to it. This is a deliberate insult. I have been kept waiting for over an hour! Then I'm sure you're ready to talk. I did not agree to allow others into this meeting. If it alarms you, I can ask them to leave. I am not alarmed, but we did not... A great many people are depending on our efforts, Gul Lemec. Let's not quibble over minutiae. I have come to negotiate a Federation withdrawal, not to be dictated to by some mere captain. I can see you're not serious about these talks. If the Cardassian Union truly wishes to discuss peace, they can send someone who can negotiate in a civilised manner. Captain on the bridge. Let him stew for a minute, then tell him you've convinced me to meet him once more. Tell him he needs to be more reasonable, because I'm so unreasonable. Lemec will want his own aides on board. Pretend to worry that I'll object, then grudgingly agree to two aides. No more. Understood? Aye, sir. Well, I'll say this for him. He's sure of himself. No, he's not. The installation should be about 300 meters this way. I don't suppose we'll find another way back up there. I doubt it. That's what I thought. There's a lava tube beyond here that runs for 75 meters. Then it connects with another chamber. We need to get through here. This tube opens up beyond this crack. We could widen the opening, then we should be able to crawl through. Mr. Worf. A phaser at level 16 should suffice. Make it so. Well done, Mr. Worf. Gul Lemec, a pleasure. May I present my aides, Glinn Corak and Glinn Tajor? Welcome aboard. For three weeks, you've been massing troops, assembling strike forces and pulling ships from their patrols. We will not stand for this clearly provocative behaviour. I see the Federation spy network has again provided faulty information. We are conducting routine training operations, nothing more. Then I'm sure you won't mind if we send a few starships in for our own training operations. Your fleet deployments do not concern us. However, we are very concerned by your refusal to vacate territories which are clearly Cardassian. You gave up your claims when you signed the armistice! You couldn't take those worlds by force. Now you want us to give you them. Captain, please, we should listen to them. Gul Lemec, the systems are still under negotiation under the treaty. Negotiations which we have pursued in good faith. Unfortunately, the Federation has not been as forthcoming. So, to speed things up, you prepare for war! We are preparing to defend ourselves. The Federation won't start a war. That has always been your position. However, I have heard reports that a small Federation team has already been sent into our territory. Of course, I don't believe it. Such an attempt would almost certainly fail. And, even if it succeeded, it would trigger a very serious response on our part. I don't know what you're talking about. Then there's no need for worry. A brief recess would seem to be in order. Very well. Where is Capt Picard? Reassigned. Well, I hope his new assignment is not too dangerous. It would be a shame if something were to happen to such a... Such a noted officer. Yes, ... ..it would. Only a few more meters. Beverly! Get out of there! Beverly! I have her! Are you alright? I think so. Next time, you try bringing up the rear. We're nearly there. Can you continue? Looks like a maintenance hatch to the installation. I'm picking up three proximity sensors around it. Sensor echoes established, but the false image will only last a few minutes. The hatch is magnetically sealed, but I believe I can bypass it. I can't get a scan through the hatch. It's been shielded. We have no choice. Remember, aim low. Short controlled bursts. Ready. Now! There's no one here. There's no lab. It's a trap! Come on! Captain! Let's go! The Captain! No! There are five more of them heading this way. Come on! Now! Come on! Captain on the bridge. What have you got, Will? We're getting coded messages from a Cardassian planet on the border. Which planet? Celtris III. Can you detect any theta-band emissions? There are residual traces. It seems there were emissions until just now. Open a secure channel to Admiral Necheyev. Priority two. In my ready room. Aye, sir. Captain? Those emissions have just stopped. I'd say, one way or another, our friends have finished. Have you heard from our friends? No. Let me know if you do. I would very much like to see them again. So would l, Admiral. A challenge! You should prove an interesting challenge. Possibly the most interesting to come through that door in years. What do you want? Why, you, of course. Picard! Jean-Luc. Serial number, SP-937-215. Son of Maurice and Yvette Picard. Born in Labarre, France. Formerly Captain of the Stargazer, where you conducted studies on theta-band subspace carrier waves. Don't look so surprised. How could we lure the Captain of the Federation flagship unless we knew something of his background? So, you concocted an elaborate ruse to bring me here. Why? In this room, you do not ask questions. I ask them, you answer. If I am not satisfied with your answers, you will die. (ENGLISH) "
S6E11,"Last time on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". ""You are requested and required to relinquish command to Capt Edward Jellico, Commanding Officer, USS Cairo, as of this date."" I want this ship ready for action and I don't have time to give Will Riker or anyone else a chance. And forgive me for being blunt, but the Enterprise is mine now. Our orders are to penetrate the Celtris III installation. It's a trap! Come on! Let's go! The Captain! No! There are five more of them heading this way. You should prove an interesting challenge. Possibly the most interesting to come through that door in years. What do you want? Why, you, of course. And now, the conclusion. Your place of birth? Labarre, France. Mother's name? Yvette Gessard. He's ready. Keep the serum at that level. What is your current assignment? Special operations on Celtris III. What is your mission on Celtris III? To seek and destroy a metagenic weapon. How many others were part of this mission? Two. Name and rank? Chief Medical Officer Beverly Crusher. Lt Worf. What are the Federation's defence plans for Minos Korva? I don't know. Increase the level slightly to 0.31 . Let's begin again, shall we? Name? Picard. Jean-Luc. Place of birth? Labarre, France. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 46360.8. Negotiations with the Cardassians have made little progress. I believe a military confrontation may be unavoidable. Gul Lemec, I assure you that what the Federation wants above all is peace. Then how do you explain the Federation's unprovoked assault on Cardassian territory 14 hours ago? I don't know what you mean. Then let me explain. Capt Jean-Luc Picard, Lt Worf and Dr Beverly Crusher landed on Celtris III, brutally attacked one of our outposts and killed over 55 men, women and children. What evidence do you have of that? We have all the evidence we need. We have Capt Picard. Is he alive? The Cardassian Union has yet to decide how it will respond to this latest provocation. But, rest assured, ... ..we will respond. Is there any truth in this? They were sent to investigate reports of a metagenic weapon on Celtris III. It's possible that they may have been captured. But if they did escape, they'll head for the Lyshan System. The Enterprise is to meet them there in eight hours. Will, I want you to take a shuttle and head for the rendezvous point. We will have to stay here until the endgame with Gul Lemec is played. Aye, sir. Capt Picard. I demand to see a neutral representative as required by the Federation-Cardassian peace treaty. We have sent a message to Tovhun III, the nearest neutral planet. They assure us they will send someone immediately. Will you allow me to remove your restraints? You are a student of archaeology. Did you know that Cardassia boasts some of the most ancient and splendid ruins in the galaxy? I know that the burial vaults of the First Hebitian civilization are said to be magnificent. Apparently, when they were unearthed 200 years ago, they were. The vaults contained unimaginably beautiful artefacts made of jevonite, a rare, breathtaking stone. But most of those objects are gone. What happened to them? What happens to impoverished societies. The tombs were plundered, priceless treasures stolen. A few were preserved in museums, but even those were eventually sold to pay for our war efforts. That war cost you hundreds of thousands of lives. It depleted your food supplies, left your population weakened and miserable, and yet you risk another war. Let's not waste time arguing about issues we cannot resolve. Would you care to tour the Hebitian burial vaults? What I would like is to be returned to my ship. My dear Captain, you are a criminal. You've been apprehended invading one of our secret facilities. The least that will happen is for you to stand trial and be punished. But I'm offering you the opportunity for that experience to be... ..civilised. What is the price of that opportunity? Cooperation. We need to know the Federation's defence strategy for Minos Korva. You've injected me with drugs. Surely you must realize I've answered truthfully every question put to me. Captain, ... ..we have gone to great lengths to lure you here because we know that in the event of an invasion, the Enterprise will be the Command ship for the sector encompassing Minos Korva. Then it seems you have more knowledge of the situation than I. Wasted energy, Captain. You might wish you hadn't expended it in such a futile effort. Torture is forbidden by the Seldonis IV Convention governing the treatment of prisoners of war! Are you in good health? Do you have any physical ailments I should know about? Beautiful, isn't it? The stone is jevonite. And now you know why it is so highly prized. From this point on, you will enjoy no privilege of rank, no privileges of person. From now on... ..I will refer to you only as human. You have no other identity! First Officer's log, supplemental. I have returned from the rendezvous point with Dr Crusher and Lt Worf. Capt Picard's fate is still unknown. We couldn't go back for the Captain. We barely made it to the Ferengi cargo ship ourselves. You were smart not to try. I don't feel so smart. Get some rest, Doctor. Will. I want Geordi to analyze the readings from Beverly's tricorder. Tell him to scrutinize every detail of those caverns on Celtris III. Aye, sir. Request permission to begin planning a rescue operation. I know you were close to him, Will, but we don't even know if he's alive. Under the circumstances, a rescue mission would be foolhardy. Shouldn't we assume he's alive until proved dead? We can't just abandon him. He's gone! I'm sorry, Will, but you're gonna have to accept that. I want those tricorder readings analyzed by 1400 hours. Yes, sir. Good morning. I trust you slept well. Thirsty? I would imagine so. Well, it's time to move on. I've told you all that I know. Yes, I'm sure you have. How many lights do you see there? I see four lights. No, there are five. Are you quite sure? There are four lights. Perhaps you are aware of the incision in your chest. While you were under our drugs, you were implanted with a small device. It's a remarkable invention! By entering commands in this pad, I can produce pain in any part of your body, various levels of severity. Forgive me. I don't enjoy this, but I must demonstrate. It will make everything clearer. Surprising, isn't it? People feel they can steel themselves against it, but they're unprepared for the intensity of the pain. That was the lowest possible setting. I know nothing about Minos Korva. But I've told you, I believe you. I didn't ask you about Minos Korva. I asked how many lights you see. There are four lights. I don't understand how you can be so mistaken. What is your current assignment? Special operations on Celtris III. Do you have anything to say? Capt Picard was not acting under my orders. And if we wish to execute him? Under the Seldonis Convention... The Seldonis Convention applies to prisoners of war. Which means you admit he was on a mission authorized by Federation. Are you willing to make such an admission? No. Then he will be treated as a terrorist. It's not my concern. There is, of course, an alternative. I'm listening. If the Federation agreed to a complete withdrawal from this sector, then we would be disposed to release Capt Picard and forget about this incident. I'll have to discuss this with my superiors. Of course. You have seven hours. What will you do? Send a message to Admiral Necheyev. I recommend that she reject Lemec's proposal and deploy additional ships along the border. What about Capt Picard? I don't suggest you trade a star system for one man's life, but these were Federation orders and he is a prisoner of war. No! He will be protected by the Convention. That would play into Lemec's hand. He's waiting for a sign of weakness. I can't believe you'd sacrifice Capt Picard as a negotiation tactic! Will! Captain, we're all concerned... Are you questioning my judgement? It is my responsibility to point out any actions that may be mistakes by a commanding officer, sir. Then maybe it's time you found other responsibilities. You're relieved. Don't make me confine you to quarters as well. Sir. They worked hard to lure a Federation team to that planet. Why? They may have been specifically interested in capturing Capt Picard. Why? The metagenic weapon they were supposedly developing used a theta-band delivery system. Capt Picard is one of only three Starfleet captains with experience in theta-band devices. The other two are no longer in Starfleet. So they tailored a fake weapon to lure Picard. But why? They must know we'd change his access codes and security protocols. Maybe they were interested in something he did in the past while he was Captain. Or in something he was going to do in the future. If the Cardassians attack, the Enterprise will be assigned as Command ship for this sector. If they got wind of that... They might assume Capt Picard knew those defence plans. If your theory is correct, they may be planning an attack in this sector. The question is where? Geordi, run a discreet scan of Gul Lemec's ship. Look for anything unusual that might indicate where they've been lately. Aye, sir. I want you to be very careful with your wompat from now on, Jil Orra. Now she's left her mother, she depends on you. I will, Father. Do humans have mothers and fathers? Yes. But human mothers and fathers don't love their children as we do. They're not the same as we are. Will you read to me tonight? Of course I will! I'll see you later. Your daughter is lovely. Yes, I think so. And unusually bright. It's amazing, isn't it, the way they're able to sneak into your heart? I must admit I was unprepared for the power she had over me, from the moment she was born. I am surprised that you let her come in here. Why? To expose a child to... ..this. To someone who is suffering. To see that it is you that inflict that suffering. From the time Jil Orra could crawl, she's been taught about our enemies and that they deserve their fate. When children learn to devalue others, they can devalue anyone, including their parents. What a blind, narrow view you have. What an arrogant man you are! What do you know of Cardassian history? I know that once, you were a peaceful people with a rich spiritual life. What did peace and spirituality get us? Millions starved. Bodies went unburied. Disease was rampant. Suffering was unimaginable. Since the military took over, hundreds of thousands more have died. But we are feeding the people. We acquired territory during the wars. We developed new resources. We initiated a rebuilding programme. We have mandated agricultural programmes. That is what the military has done for Cardassia. And, because of that, my daughter will never worry about going hungry. Her belly may be full, but her spirit will be empty. Shall we begin again? How many lights are there? What lights? It looks like some minor hull degradation on their warp nacelles, The pattern indicates recent exposure to a molecular-dispersion field. Where could they have run into one? The McAllister C-5 nebula, seven light years from Federation space. Could there be Cardassian ships inside the nebula? Maybe, but they couldn't stay in there long. The nebula's particle flux would break down a hull after 72 hours. Is there a Federation system near the nebula that might interest the Cardassians? Minos Korva is just 11 light years from the nebula. And the Cardassians tried to annex it during the war. Data, I want to be at Minos Korva in one hour. Aye, sir. Set course 350, mark 215 and engage at warp 8.5. Wake up. Where were you? At home. Sunday dinner. We would all sing afterwards. What a charming picture. The Picard family, voices raised in song. Is that what's keeping you from breaking? Memories of home and hearth, images of happier times? I congratulate you. You're remarkably strong-willed. I see no point holding you further. You may go. Someone will give you clean clothing before we return you to your ship. We will get what we need from the human female. What female are you referring to? The one who was part of your abortive assault team. Dr Beverly Crusher. What have you done to her? Not a thing. She's quite safe. I wanted to finish interviewing you before interrogating her. I had hoped it might not be necessary. Lt Worf? He left us few options. We had to kill him. I'm optimistic we can get what we need from the woman. Dr Crusher has no knowledge of any Starfleet operations. She's a Medical officer. You might be right. I'll determine that for myself. Are you choosing to stay with me? Excellent. I can't tell you how pleased that makes me. Starfleet now believes the Cardassians will invade Minos Korva. I'm convinced their invasion fleet is hiding in the McAllister Nebula. We'll hit it before they leave it. Captain, what if you're wrong? What if the Cardassians are there to conduct research? You'd need good evidence to convince me of that. You're still gambling hundreds of lives. This discussion is moot. The plan has been approved. We are going ahead. Mr. Data, how long could the Cardassians stay in the nebula? In 17 hours, their hull degradation will become dangerous. They must leave before that. Alright. Worf, prepare 500 antimatter mines with magnetic targeting capability. Aye, sir. Geordi, we'll need a shuttle, specially outfitted for the nebula, by 1400. Beverly, you'll need to... ..have sickbay ready for the casualties you'll send me. That's right. Dismissed. You're awake. Have something to eat. I insist. Boiled taspar egg. It's a delicacy I'm happy to share with you. Wonderful! Wonderful! I like you, human. Most people become ill at the sight of live taspar. I remember the first time I ate a live taspar. I was six years old and living on the streets of Lakat. There was a band of children, four, five, six years old, some even smaller, desperately trying to survive. We were thin, scrawny little animals, constantly hungry, always cold. We slept in doorways, like packs of wild gettles, for warmth. Once, I found a nest. Taspars had built a nest in the eave of a burnt-out building and I found three eggs in it. It was like finding treasure. I cracked one open on the spot and ate it, very much as you just did. I planned to save the other two. That would keep me alive for another week. But, of course, an older boy saw them and wanted them. And he got them. But he had to break my arm to do it. Must be rewarding to you to repay others for all those years of misery. What do you mean? Torture has never been a reliable means of extracting information. It is ultimately self-defeating as a means of control. One wonders that it's still practiced. I fail to see where this analysis is leading. Whenever I look at you now, ... ..I won't see a powerful Cardassian warrior. I will see a six-year-old boy who is powerless to protect himself. Be quiet! In spite of all you've done to me, I find you a pitiable man. Picard, stop it. Or I will turn this on and leave you in agony all night. You called me ""Picard""! What are the Federation's defence plans for Minos Korva? There are four lights! There are five lights! How many do you see now? You are six years old! Weak and helpless. You cannot hurt me! How many? How are we doing? Almost done, sir. I've shielded the nacelles and the transporter system against particle-flux from the nebula. Good. Been a while since I flew one of these. You're a pilot, aren't you, Geordi? Yes, sir. I began my career as a shuttle pilot, on the Jovian run, from Jupiter to Saturn and back, once a day, every day. Is that right? I was on that run myself for a while. Then you must have done Titan's Turn. Yeah, You set a course directly for Titan, hold it till you're just brushing the atmosphere, throw the helm hard over and whip round the moon at 0.7C. And pray like hell nobody saw you. This trip into the nebula will need someone who can do Titan's Turn in their sleep. The mines must be laid within two kilometers of the Cardassian ships. But the flux will blind all sensors except this proximity detector. You need one heck of a pilot to pull that off. Is that you? I could do it. But, truthfully, the man you want is Cmdr Riker. He's the best there is. Come in. Am I disturbing you? Not at all. A musician. Yes. Classical? Contemporary? Jazz. Is there something I can do for you, Captain? Are you aware of our plans to attack the Cardassian fleet? Yes, sir. I understand you've been talking to every shuttle pilot on board. Let's drop ranks for a moment. I don't like you. I think you're insubordinate, arrogant, wilful. And I don't think you're a particularly good first officer. But you are also the best pilot on the ship. Well, now that the ranks are dropped, Captain, I don't like you, either. You are arrogant and closed-minded. You need to control everything and everyone. You don't provide an atmosphere of trust. You don't inspire people. You've got everyone wound up so tight, there's no joy in anything. I don't think you're a particularly good captain. I won't order you to fly this mission. Then ask me. Will you pilot the shuttle, Commander? Yes. You're welcome. We've lost primary navigation. Switching to secondary. Inertial dampers compensating. Sensors inoperative. Right on schedule. The proximity detector is working. We should read their ships at a distance of 500 meters. Don't make this too easy. Hang on. Do I wanna know how close that was? No. Get ready to deploy the mines. Captain, the shuttle is emerging from the nebula. Enterprise to shuttle. Were you successful, Commander? Aye, sir. The mines are laid. Very well. Red alert. Stand by to detonate the mines on my command. Standing by. Open a channel to the Reklar. This is Cardassian territory! Your presence is deliberate provocation... I won't argue, Gul Lemec. Every one of your ships is mined, my finger is on the button, and you're in a very bad position. You can't intimidate us. Mr. Worf, set off Alpha 42. Aye, sir. That was just a baby. The big boys are on your hull, just waiting for the word. What are your terms? Your ships will leave the nebula one by one. Each ship will eject its primary phaser coil before setting course for the nearest Cardassian base. But that will leave us defenceless! Mr. Worf, prepare to detonate... I will agree to your terms. Excellent. And one more thing. I understand you're holding a Starfleet officer, Jean-Luc Picard. I expect him returned immediately. That won't help. I have many more. Still, it felt good. Enjoy your good feelings while you can. There may not be many more of them. I've just received word. There's been a battle. The Enterprise is burning in space. The invasion of Minos Korva has been successful. I don't believe you. I no longer need information from you. Our troops were successful, despite your refusal to help me. You might have saved yourself much torment by yielding. I want to see a neutral representative. There is no such person. The word will be that you perished with your crew. No one will ever know that you are here with us, as you will be for a long, long time. You do, however, have a choice. You can live out your life in misery, held here, subject to my whims, or you can live in comfort with good food and warm clothing, women as you desire them, free to pursue your studies of philosophy and history. I would enjoy debating with you. You have a keen mind. It's up to you. A life of ease and reflection and intellectual challenge, ... ..or this. What must I do? Nothing, really. Tell me how many lights you see. How many? How many lights? This is your last chance. The guards are coming, don't be a stubborn fool. How many? You told me he would be ready to go. We had some unfinished business. Get him cleaned up. A ship is waiting to take him back to the Enterprise. Capt Picard. If you'll go with the guards, they'll take care of you. There are four lights! Captain on the bridge. Welcome home, Jean-Luc. Thank you. Just the way you left it, maybe a little better. Computer, transfer all command codes to Capt Jean-Luc Picard. Voice authorization, Jellico, Alpha three one. Transfer complete. USS Enterprise now under command of Capt Picard. I relieve you, sir. I stand relieved. It's been an honour serving with you. You have the bridge, Number One. Aye, sir. I... I don't know where to begin. It was... I read your report. What I didn't put in the report was that at the end, he gave me a choice between a life of comfort or more torture. All I had to do was to say that I could see five lights when, in fact, there were only four. You didn't say it? No. But I was going to. I would have told him anything. Anything at all. But, more than that, ... ..I believed that I could see... ..five lights. (ENGLISH) "
S6E12,"It was then I suspected that your brother did not die by his own hand. That he was, in fact... ..murdered. Murdered? Huh! Good Lord! But, Holmes! The vial of poison found in his hand! That was the first clue. The vial contained strychnine which induces violent spasms. I cannot imagine someone in the throes of so gruesome a death could hold on to so delicate a container without shattering it. You don't mean... Exactly! The vial was placed in his hand after he died. Then what was the cause of death? The cigar, of course. Cigar? Upon investigation of the room in which your brother was found, I discovered a fresh burn mark on the carpet. The ash revealed the cigar was laced with strychnine. This is utter nonsense! What about the suicide note? It was written in my dear brother's own hand. With practice, handwriting can be forged. It takes a trained eye to notice certain... discrepancies. For example, whether someone is right- or left-handed. Your brother was right-handed. The note was written by a left- handed individual such as yourself. Data, it's in his right hand. Curious. There seems to be a problem with the spatial-orientation systems. London's greatest detective? Freeze program. La Forge to Barclay. Barclay here. Reg, something went wrong with the holodeck again. I'm sorry. I'll look into it right away. Thanks, Reg. We should get back to Engineering. Computer, end program and save. Whoa, Reg! Sorry, I'm just on my way. Sherlock Holmes program 3A has very curious anomalies. A glitch in the matrix diodes. I'll track it down. Thanks, Reg. See you later. Computer, run a diagnostic on all Sherlock Holmes files. Display any anomalous programming sequences. Diagnostic complete. All files conform to specified parameters, except those in protected memory. Protected memory? Display those sequences. Computer, unlock sequence and run the program. Who are you? Professor James Moriarty. Moriarty. That's Sherlock Holmes's arch-enemy. Are you left or right-handed? Left. Would you mind...? No problem. Where is Capt Picard? Is he still captain of this vessel? How would...? How do you know the Captain? You don't know anything about what happened, do you? I have been stored for God knows how long. No one has given me a thought. You know! You know what you are! A holodeck character? A fictional man? Yes, I know all about your marvellous inventions. I was created as a plaything so that your Cmdr Data could masquerade as Sherlock Holmes. But they made me too well. I became more than a character in a story. I became self-aware. I... am alive. That's not possible. But here I am. Tell me, has a way been found to allow me to leave this holodeck world? Leave the holodeck? Of course not! You can only exist here. Damn you, Picard. He promised me something would be done. I should have realized he would say anything for my hostage. Hostage? How long have I been... locked away? Well, it looks like about... four years. It seemed longer. You can't have been aware of the passage of time! But I was. Brief, terrifying periods of consciousness. Disembodied. Without substance. I don't see how that could be possible. Maybe there was a fragmentation of the memory circuits. Call it what you will. All I know is, despite Picard's promise, he has done nothing. Just left me to go quietly mad. The Captain would not have forgotten his promise. I'd like to talk to him. Well, I can ask. Ask him to meet me in the sitting room at Baker Street. I'll have to store you in memory again until I get an answer. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 46424. 1. The Enterprise is in the Detrian system for a unique celestial event. The collision of two planets. Since both planets are gas giants, neither possesses solid surface. Their atmospheres will come into contact in 17 hours, nine minutes. If their collision causes a fusion reaction, this is what we may see. The birth of a new star. The Enterprise will hold position till we can get in for a look. I want triple redundancy on all sensor arrays. We'll probably never get another chance to see this. OK? Commander, you'll never believe what happened with your holodeck program. Professor Moriarty appeared. Out of nowhere. What? And he wants to talk to the Captain. Computer, begin Sherlock Holmes 3A and place us in the drawing room at 221B Baker Street. Program complete. Computer, access protected memory and run Moriarty program. Professor. It's good to see you again. If you'd missed my company, you should have summoned me before now. I assure you, we did not forget. We spent time investigating how you became self-aware. Frankly, it still remains a mystery. It is also irrelevant. What concerns me is how to leave the holodeck. We have wrestled with that, too, but without success. But we turned it over to Starfleet's most experienced scientists. What did your finest minds come up with? Unfortunately, they have not arrived at a solution. I see. Professor, I am concerned to learn that you experienced the passage of time while you were stored in the computer. I assure you, we had no idea that would be the case. Enough of this. I no longer believe anything you say. I understand your frustration. Do you really? When this is over, you will walk out to your own concerns and leave me trapped in a world I know to be an illusion. I cannot bear that. I must leave. That is not possible. You cannot exist outside this room. Are you certain of that? Computer, exit. Although objects appear solid on the holodeck, ... ..in the real world, they have no substance. An object has no life. I do. Professor, you are a computer simulation. I have consciousness. Conscious beings have will. The mind endows them with powers that are not necessarily understood. Even by you. If my will is strong enough, perhaps I can exist outside this room. Perhaps I can walk into your world right now. Professor, believe me. If you step out, you will cease to exist. If I am no more than a computer simulation, then very little will have been lost. But if I am right... Mind over matter... Cogito ergo sum. I think therefore I am. Data to Security, two officers to holodeck three. How is this possible? It contradicts holodeck physics. Perhaps you know less than you thought. Please allow our doctor to examine you. Certainly, sir. Policemen. I'd recognize them in any century. As far as I can tell, he's real. He's human. What else would I be, dear lady? His DNA is a little unusual but all the major systems are functioning normally. As far as I can tell, his molecules have not lost any cohesion. They seem as immutable as ordinary matter. Well, Professor, my crew will continue to investigate, but... ..for now you have accomplished a miracle. The question is, now that you're here, what do we do with you? I ask only that I be allowed to explore this new world. Your vessel, for instance. What sea does she sail? Might we go above deck? Weather permitting, of course. Professor. I think there are things of which you should be aware. My God! We're adrift in the heavens. No, not adrift. The Enterprise is a starship, capable of travelling through space. Extraordinary! Are we far from Earth? What is its range? What is its means of locomotion? There is so much to learn. Where to start? I can give you books. Good. I want to start making plans. Determine what to do with my life. I hope you plan on remaining on board. There is much we need to understand about what has happened. Does it really matter? The point is, I'm here, eager to get on with life. Professor, I feel it necessary to point out that criminal behaviour is as unacceptable in the 24th century as in the 19th. And very much harder to get away with. Don't worry, Captain, my past is nothing but a fiction. The scribblings of an Englishman, dead for four centuries. I hope to leave his books on the shelf, as it were. If that is so, there are opportunities awaiting you that are beyond anything you have ever imagined. Your century may welcome me, but... What is the matter? In considering all these vast possibilities, ... ..I suddenly feel very much alone. I am a man out of time, Captain. That isolates me. You have been more gracious than I could have imagined. I wonder. May I impose upon your generosity once again? There is a woman, the Countess Regina Barthalomew. She was created as a holodeck character for Cmdr Data. She was designed to be the love of my life. Could she also be brought off the holodeck? Professor, believe me when I say that we do not know how or why you are able to exist off the holodeck. I do believe you. According to the laws of physics, this is impossible. We have no idea how to do it again. As I understand it, I was endowed with consciousness when someone said to the computer, ""Create an opponent with a capacity to out-think Data."" Or words to that effect. Make a similar request for the Countess. Even if I had reason to believe it would be successful, I don't think I could sanction it. Please understand that you are, in essence, a new life form. One we didn't intend to create and don't fully understand. The moral and ethical implications of deliberately creating another like you are overwhelming. Is it morally and ethically acceptable to deny the woman I love so that your conscience can be at ease? Are you saying you will dictate how I live my life? I assure you, we will do everything to make you comfortable. So long as I accept the terms of those comforts? Captain. I am a powerless man. You hold my future, my happiness, ... ..my very life in your hands. Please. Consider my request. I understand his frustration. We created him and then her to be the woman he loves. Surely we have some responsibility to them. It's romantic but until we know more, I don't think we should try it again. Even if we decided to do it, there is no guarantee we could. There is no way of knowing if the Professor's ability to exist is permanent. It may be unwise to create a second individual without certainty. Agreed. We don't have enough information about this... phenomenon to act responsibly. I think we'll hold off on his request. But continue with your investigation. In the meantime, I have to deal with Professor Moriarty. I feel we must postpone action until we learn more. Yes, you know all about that. I stayed in your computer for years waiting for you to learn more. It wasn't until I took matters over that something got done. Professor, why are you in a hurry? Is this woman involved with you in some illegal venture? Your computer designed her as a person with impeccable integrity. She would never commit a crime. You must love her very much. The program fashioned her for me to love. But I must admit, I would have done so, anyway. She is remarkable. My life has not been the same since I met her. I don't simply love her, Captain. I adore her. Then her safety must be important to you. Give us time to determine what is going on. So we can minimize the risks in bringing her to you. You wouldn't want to lose her because we acted too quickly. Riker to Capt Picard. Picard here. Could you join us? On my way. There they are, Captain. How long before they coalesce? Five hours, sir. Mr. Worf, launch four class-A probes towards the planet. Aye, sir. Mr. Worf? I don't understand. The controls are not responding. Command functions are being rerouted. For what reason? Unknown, sir. Computer, route command functions to the bridge. Command functions are off line. Reinitialize on my authorization. Authorization denied. Explain. Picard command codes are no longer valid. What's happening? Who's transferred the voice authorization? I have. I'm afraid I had no choice but to take control. If you harm me, I will not be able to relinquish voice control. Professor, this situation is more serious than you realize. In five hours, those planets will collide and a new star will form. Unless we move, this vessel will be destroyed. I'm just a fictional character. I haven't much to lose. But surely you wish to live? Not without the Countess. We've discussed that. We are studying means of bringing her safely off the holodeck. But five hours is not enough time. I'm not so sure. A deadline has a wonderful way of concentrating the mind. Mr. Data, will you investigate the possibility of complying with Professor Moriarty's request? Aye, sir. In the meantime, ... ..we have a few things to discuss. Let us consider the transporter system. It uses the same principles as the holodeck. Both are capable of converting energy into matter. But the transporter reconstitutes permanent form. Holodeck matter has no cohesion outside the grid. I wonder. What would happen if we beamed a holodeck object off the grid? Nothing. A holodeck object is a simulation. There is no pattern-lock for the transporter. However, if it were possible to lock on to the object, it might rematerialize with the same cohesion as conventional matter. I don't think the transporter will accept simulated matter. Unless we could find a way to compensate for the phase variance. If we could modify the pattern enhancers we might do it. Professor Moriarty has agreed not to interfere with operations so long as he believes we are acting in good faith. Any progress? We were talking about using the transporter to beam the Countess off the holodeck. But I don't see how it would work. Keep at it. I have to tell him that we are making progress. Mr. La Forge? Do you have any idea how Moriarty gained control of the ship? Somehow, he managed to override the lockouts and rewrite them. The man is brilliant in any century. I want you to find some way... ..to undo what he has done... ..so that we can regain control of this ship. Set the pattern enhancers around whatever you wish to transport. I will go to the transporter room and begin modifications. Computer, run Sherlock Holmes program 3A. That program is already in use. Have you come to see Mr. Holmes or Professor Moriarty? Neither is in just now. No, I'm not here to see anyone. I'm... ..just here to deliver these. Fine. Just... ..put them anywhere. Well, actually, I have to put them right here. How curious! Why's that? It has to do with... Nothing you need to worry about, Countess. Are you suggesting that it's beyond my comprehension? It's very simple. I need to enhance the molecular pattern of this chair so that the transporter can get a better lock on the signal. This has to do with taking James and me into the real world. You know about that? You understand about the real world? James has explained it. It sounds like a grand adventure. There's nothing I love more than voyaging in the unknown. Have you ever been to Africa, Mr...? Barclay. Lt Reginald Barclay. No, I haven't. I have. When I was 17, I went on safari with my uncle. My mother had a terror I'd be bitten by tsetse fly. But I had a marvellous time. I got to wear trousers the whole time. It was hard to go back to a corset, I can tell you. Yes, I'm sure it was. After that, I never stopped travelling. I couldn't bear to be stuck in one place, so I'm so looking forward to this new experience! My! Travelling the stars! You know about that? You know where we are? Countess, you just don't sound like a holodeck character. That's because she isn't. James! If you loved this woman, would you let her remain a simulation? You gave her consciousness? Yes, as it was given to me. I'm not sure that's a good idea. Nonsense! Have you taken her off the holodeck? No. I am unwilling to risk the Countess's safety. I want to make sure nothing happens. We may be closer to freedom than you think. These... devices will enhance our molecular patterns. They'll help take us into the real world. Please proceed. We're going to try this chair first. We didn't want to try it on the Countess yet. How thoughtful! Isn't he thoughtful, James? Barclay to Cmdr Data. Go ahead, Lieutenant. I'm ready. Modifications are complete. Stand by. Standing by. Activating pattern enhancers. Energizing. I am having difficulty establishing a pattern lock. Boost the confinement beam, please. Pattern lock established. Energizing. Bravo! Do you have the chair, Commander? No. It lost cohesion as soon as the cycle was complete. Well, it was a long shot to begin with. Agreed. However, we may learn something from the attempt. Computer, display the transport logs from the sequence. Computer, what is being displayed here? Transport log 759. That is the correct log. No information is being presented. Well, that's impossible. It's almost as if our attempt to transport the chair... ..never occurred. You wanted to see me? Yes. I think I've found a way to reinstate your vocal authorizations. Computer, route command functions to this location. Command functions are off line. Reinitialize them on my authorization. Please input command codes. Picard, epsilon 793. Command codes verified. That should do it. Wait a minute. It didn't work. The computer won't release the command pathways. Geordi. Why did you do that? Captain. I have determined how Moriarty was able to leave the holodeck. He never did. Neither did we. None of this is real. It is a simulation. We are still on the holodeck. We're still on the holodeck? How do you know that? Through deduction, sir. Lt Barclay and I tried to transport an object off the holodeck, something that has never been attempted. Since the transporter is a simulation, the computer had no real data for the transport logs. Maybe it was a malfunction in the transporter. Then I saw you working the pad with your left hand. Cmdr La Forge is right-handed. A similar malfunction occurred in the Sherlock Holmes program before Moriarty first appeared. Mr. Data, if what you say is true, this is not Geordi. Are you certain? Computer, discontinue program. Computer, exit. Moriarty has programmed the holodeck to accept only his commands. Picard to bridge. Riker here. Number One, what is my present location? Engineering. Is something wrong, sir? No. Thank you. Picard out. Our combadges are also simulations. If that had been Riker, he would have said holodeck three. Mr. La Forge, would you excuse us, please? Mr. Data, who is real here? You and I are real, sir, as is Lt Barclay. We entered the holodeck together when we went to meet Moriarty. And from that point, we have been in a holodeck simulation created by Professor Moriarty? I believe so, sir. I have given the computer my command codes, thinking I would get control of the ship. You may have given Professor Moriarty the means of gaining control over the real Enterprise. Since Moriarty has never actually left the holodeck, he may demand that Cmdr Riker help him to do so. How long until the planetary collision? Less than three hours. So long as Moriarty has control of the ship, we are vulnerable. Somehow, ... ..I have to find a way of giving him what he wants. Where is Capt Picard? What have you done with Barclay and Data? They are safe... for now. Release control of this ship. I am afraid I can't do that. What do you want? I only want what you have the luxury of taking for granted. Freedom. I want to leave this holodeck. You know that's impossible. Your crewmates here in my little... ship in a bottle seem a bit more optimistic. They attempted to use your transporter to remove a simulated object from the holodeck. They must have thought they had something. Their attempt was futile. Their transporter was a facsimile. I expect more from you. Just because ours is real doesn't mean it will work. I sense a distressing lack of enthusiasm on your parts. Sir! Warp-core temperature is rising, approaching critical levels. I have nothing to lose, Commander. Mr. La Forge, start working on the problem. Aye, sir. Core temperature dropping. Computer, resume program. Hello. Have we met? Captain Jean-Luc Picard. James has told me all about you. Regina, Countess Barthalomew. Do sit down. May I offer you tea, Captain? Thank you, no. I've come here to prevail on your intelligence and insight. But not apparently my humility? Credit where credit is due, madam. I see you have not only breeding but wit and sagacity. And you, sir, are a man of charm... and guile. You remind me of Viscount Oglethorpe. He was a man who could bewitch any woman who breathed. Do you suspect that that is my intent? I cannot be certain of your intent. But I am certain you're a man who usually gets what he wants. What does a woman like you see in a man like Moriarty? He's an exciting man, Captain. He's brilliant. Incisive. He's ruthless. He has... an almost irresistible appeal. He's an arch-criminal. Only because he was written like that. I see him entirely differently. Captain, he is not a villain. So it's your desire to leave the holodeck to be with him? More than anything. Can you help us? Yes, I can. We have learned that if we uncouple the Heisenberg compensators and allow them to re-scramble randomly, then we can beam a holodeck object, or a person, off the grid with all the cohesion of conventional matter. That's splendid. I must tell James. No, please! Wait. I have brought you this information because... ..you are someone who would listen to a reasonable proposition. Someone whose mind is open to compromise. Yes. My ship is in danger. It is imperative that I regain navigational control. I want you to persuade Moriarty to return the voice command to me. Or I will not modify the transporter. I see. Now, once I have regained voice command, I will transport you from the holodeck. Forgive me, but that sounds more like a threat than a compromise. Countess, you must understand that I am responsible for more than 1,000 lives. I will do what I can. The gravity well is intensifying. Are we far enough away? It's too soon to tell. Riker to Lt Worf. How are you doing? Force fields are blocking access to the holodeck. It will take time to disable them. Keep trying. Aye, sir. Think, my dear. You're certain they have to uncouple the Heisenberg compensators? Yes, I'm quite certain. But he won't do it unless you return control of the ship to him. I have them running around like rats in a maze. What harm would there be in accepting his proposition? My dear, you are brilliant and beautiful. Nonetheless, there are things you do not understand. Please. You must let me handle this. Computer, arch. Moriarty to Cmdr Riker. Riker here. Cmdr Riker, a pleasure, as always. I don't have time for games, Moriarty. This ship is in a gravity well. It will be destroyed within 25 minutes, holodeck and all. Then I'm sure you'll be motivated to listen to me carefully. I want you to talk about uncoupling the Heisenberg compensators. James, when we leave here, where exactly are we going? Everywhere, my darling. There are more worlds in the heavens than grains of sand on a shore. I wish I could take my books. I'll get you more. Don't worry, you'll want for nothing. Riker to Moriarty. It's time. Yes, Commander? We're ready. As are we. Step into the transport area. We're ready here. Activating pattern enhancers. Energizing. Welcome aboard. May I present Regina, the Countess Barthalomew? Countess. Commander. You'll forgive me if I skip the formalities. Yes. I expect you want me to relinquish my hold on your vessel. Please. That won't be possible just yet. We had an agreement. I will honour it. I have no desire to see your vessel destroyed. Just give me one shuttlecraft and allow us to leave in peace. We don't have time for this. Release those command codes. I will not release your vessel until I am looking at it through a shuttlecraft window. It's programmed to operate on voice command. Just say where you want to go. Excellent. I suggest you head for Meles II, the nearest inhabited planet. The people are friendly. Where you go then is your business. Please tell your captain I'm sorry I couldn't say goodbye. I wish I could see his face when he realizes where he's been. Every second we waste puts us in danger. Don't worry. You'll soon have control of your ship. Goodbye, Commander. Thank you. Computer, prepare to depart. Open shuttle bay doors. This is so beautiful. Indeed, my dear. It is a wondrous sight. The first of many we are sure to encounter in our travels. Computer, interface with the central computer on the Enterprise. Interface complete. Release command-function lockouts. Authorization, ... ..Moriarty, Alpha 24159. James. Yes, my love? Can we go back to Earth some day? Of course, my dear. Of course. Computer, store program Picard Delta One. Discontinue simulation. Program stored. Well, it worked. They believed it. Did Moriarty release the voice commands? Let's find out. Computer, discontinue Moriarty's holodeck simulation. So far, so good. This is the holodeck on the real Enterprise. Picard to bridge. Are you alright? Yes, Number One. What is your status? Our systems came back on line. And the planetary collision? We're at a safe distance. We'll join you shortly. Captain. Mr. Worf, everything is alright. How did you do it? We managed to program the holodeck inside the holodeck and used the same ruse Moriarty used on us. When he contacted the bridge, he was speaking to a simulation. He never knew he hadn't left the holodeck? The program is continuing to run even now inside that cube. A miniature holodeck? In a way, Doctor. However, there is no physicality. The program is continuous, but only within the circuitry. As far as Moriarty knows, they're halfway to Meles II by now. This enhancement module has enough active memory to provide them with experiences for a lifetime. They will live their lives and never know any difference. In a sense, you did give Moriarty what he wanted. In a sense. Who knows? Our reality may be very much like theirs. All this might be just an elaborate simulation, running inside a little device sitting on someone's table. Well, we have a newborn star to study. Mr. Barclay, keep that safe. Aye, sir. Computer, end program. (ENGLISH) "
S6E13,"Captain's log, stardate 46461.3. We are at a communication station near the Klingon border, where we are meant to deliver supplies. However, the station has not responded to repeated hails. What's that noise? They left a monitoring system on. We're hearing thousands of subspace messages. I'll try and shut it off. Got it! Geordi, what's that? Sounds like a loose panel. I think it's coming from this service duct over here. Here's your loose panel. Hey, pooch! Hey, pooch. Come on out of there. Come on! Come on! Hey, pooch! What are you doing in there? Commander, the shuttlecraft is gone. There is no one on board. Commander? What is it? Cellular residue. I believe these are the remains of one of our lieutenants. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. All the blood traces I've found match those of Lt Aquiel Uhnari. I take it those are her remains, but I'll check the deck plate to be sure. It would take a powerful weapon to do that. I'll have a better idea soon. If that is Uhnari, where's Rocha? The station shuttle's gone. Maybe he took it. Before Uhnari died or after? We're ready, Commander. Any luck downloading the logs? I can't pass the security. I think I know why. Encrypted messages are sent through this channel. Take a look at this signal notation. It's out of sequence. Someone tried to bypass protocols and break into the coded messages. That froze the security locks. Any messages missing? I'll know once I'm in the files. Looks like you've made a friend! Yep! Tell me when you have something. I'm going to try accessing the logs from another console. What's going on here? Well, we can start with repolarising the interface. What is it, pup? What's the matter? Something over here? This doesn't look like it belongs to you. This is what you want, huh? There you go! Computer, run station logs in sequence. Station log, stardate 46458.3. Today we configured the relay-controller grid. It was the last system we had to overhaul. We are scheduled to align antenna systems in the next three days. Computer, access visual output. Sent third request for a message delay buffer. Until it arrives, we have rigged a memory module to compensate. It better work, or a half-million subspace messages are going to end up drifting through space. Computer, open Uhnari correspondence file. Computer, access correspondence files, Lt Aquiel Uhnari. Hello, Shiana. Sorry it's been a while. I've been dealing with the new Lieutenant, Rocha. He's arrogant and condescending, and he's only been here two days. This might be a long year. C'mon, Lieutenant. Stick with me. I had the dream again. Mother's calling out my name. She's in the house. I get to the top of the hill but the house is slanted. I'm still walking uphill. I can't find her. Doors everywhere and they all look the same. The cellular residue is completely fused to the deck plate. We're trying to micro-vaporise the metal to get a clear DNA sample. Do you have any idea what killed her? Well, this is just a guess, but from the molecules of the plating I'd say it was caused by a high-level phaser blast. A Klingon disruptor? Possibly. The messages have been tampered with. And we are close to Klingon space. There hasn't been a Klingon raid against us for more than seven years. We can't risk a diplomatic incident without more evidence. And there's still the question of what happened to Lt Rocha. Get Rocha's file from Starfleet Command and ask Starbase 212 to help us find the shuttle. Keep me apprised, Doctor. Alright, let's try this again. Come on, this should be working! The phase inducers are aligned. Come on, Lieutenant. I know you're in here somewhere. Computer, run me a subsystems diagnostic with a frequency range of 10 to 100MHz. Diagnostic cycle will be complete in 20 seconds. Iced coffee? What is it, girl? Hello, Shiana. There! By the time you get this, the Batarael will be over. It's the first time I haven't been there. I've been wondering, who's singing the Harath in my place? I had that dream again, the one where Mother is screaming. I climb the hill to our house, but I can't get to her. Shiana, this time I ran away. I was so scared, I ran back down the hill. I think I know why I've been having the dreams about danger. It's because of what's been happening with that Klingon. He's getting more aggressive all the time. Not just the usual threat. It's because of what's been happening with that Klingon. He's getting more aggressive all the time. Not just the usual threat. Morag actually locked his disruptors to the station this time. I don't think there'll be any trouble. It just... brings up those feelings of... panic, of wanting to run, wanting to get away from danger. Shiana, I couldn't say this to anyone but you, but the panic... It's the same thing I used to feel whenever Father got angry, when I knew he was going to punish me. Only now, I'm out here in space. And there's nowhere to run. Three times she refers to Cmdr Morag, a Klingon who patrols this section. Apparently he passed by the station every few days and harassed them. Perhaps this Morag was interested in obtaining the encrypted messages. She didn't say but I do have several more days of logs to watch. I'm hoping to learn more. Very well. In the meantime I'll speak with the Klingon governor about Cmdr Morag. Are you saying we attacked your outpost? I'm merely saying I'm following up on evidence discovered on board. Evidence. So you are making an accusation? The Klingon Empire will not stand for these kinds of lies. Governor Torak, I apologize. I see that you honestly didn't know what happened aboard the station. I will just have to take this up with Gowron. I'm sorry we bothered you. Gowron won't bother with such a minor incident. Ordinarily he wouldn't but I was his arbiter of succession. I'm sure he will be happy to come and investigate this. You needn't worry about it any longer. Gowron will come here? Oh, yes. So once again, thank you for your help. I will be sure to mention your name to Gowron when I speak to him. I will investigate this further, Picard. You need not bother Gowron with this matter. That's very kind. Qapla'! Qapla'! Computer, access the personal logs of Aquiel Uhnari. Logs accessed. Begin playback. Shiana, you always said I'd look great in a wig. So here it is. What do you think? Definitely not you. OK. Maybe I'm getting a little crazy. You would, too, stuck on a relay station in the middle of nowhere with no one for company except an egomaniac like Keith Rocha. I took a big risk today. I countermanded an order he gave. I agreed to handle the comm traffic for Relay Station 194 while they shut down for maintenance. Rocha said we couldn't handle the extra signal load but I think he's wrong. When he finds out, he'll be furious. It's days like this I wish I was home. You know what I miss most? Muskan seed punch. Real muskan seed punch. The replicator has it but it's not the same. I'd give anything for the punch Mother used to make, with chunks of the seed still in it. Keith, is that you? Keith? Commander. There are DNA traces here. Klingon. So Klingons did board the station? Yes. But I only found DNA from one Klingon so far. I will continue to scan. How could she read this stuff? How's it going? I've accessed all Lt Uhnari's logs. I'm still looking for Lt Rocha's. Whatever happened to the encrypted messages affected the whole system. I can't find his files anywhere. I'm running a diagnostic now. Maybe Rocha didn't make the logs. That could have been Uhnari's job. I don't think so. Aquiel was the junior officer. Aquiel? Lt Uhnari. I've been up all night watching her. I'm starting to feel I know her. What was she like? Well, she was Haliian. She had one sister named Shiana. She drank muskan seed punch. She... had a quirky sense of humour. She liked to sing. She... had questionable taste in literature. Enterprise to Cmdr Riker. Riker here. The Klingon ship Qu'Vat has arrived with Governor Torak. Report to the observation lounge. We're on our way. Governor Torak, sir. Welcome aboard. Do not bore me with your human pleasantries. I told you we did not kill the woman. Now I will prove it to you. This is Lt Aquiel Uhnari. We were running a diagnostic of the message buffer. Nothing special. Rocha had been on edge all morning. But he'd constantly been irritable so I didn't think anything of it. We were halfway through the procedure when suddenly he... attacked me. He threw me against a bulkhead. I yelled at him to stop but he wouldn't listen. He grabbed my throat, I broke free and tried to get to the weapons locker. I'm not sure what happened next but somehow I got aboard the shuttle and left. We found her on our side of the border, heading toward Sector 2520. She is lucky my patrol ship did not destroy her vessel on sight. Lieutenant... Why didn't you contact Starfleet? Let them know what had happened at the station. I don't know, sir. Maybe I passed out. I'm not even sure how long I was on this shuttle before I was picked up. 46 hours. You've been gone 46 hours. We presumed you were dead. Your blood was found at the murder scene. I must have cut my head when he pushed me. Then the remains we found must be those of Lt Rocha. I can't confirm that. Until we separate the cellular residue from the deck plate, I can't do a clear DNA scan. You said you were trying to get to the weapons locker. Is there a possibility you did? No, I... didn't. You're sure? I don't remember exactly what happened to me after I was attacked. I'm sorry. It's as if all my memories were drained out of me. Morag was harassing you. Did you let him or any other Klingon on board? Absolutely not. If that is true, then Morag or some other Klingon boarded the station after she left. We found traces of Klingon DNA on the station. You still try to blame us! Have the courage to admit your mistakes. Or are you a Io'Be Vos? At last I do not wear the uniform of the pahtk! Governor, we are merely exploring all possibilities. Lt Uhnari's logs reported that Cmdr Morag had been harassing the station. He was doing his job. In that case, I am sure you would not mind if we spoke with him. Very well. In the interests of diplomacy I will allow you to speak to Morag. But my patience has limits. Lieutenant, I know a friend of yours who's eager to see you. Who? Come with me. Maura! Come here, girl! Come on, Maura! Maura? That's the name, huh? Yes, it's from Cold Moon Over Black Water. Have you read it? I'm not much for Gothic fiction. Not many people are nowadays. Your shoe! Yeah, Maura got a little restless. Shame on you! That's not like you. What a naughty dog. Don't worry about it. At least she's chewing them up in pairs. I'll arrange quarters for you. You'll want some time alone. Actually, I've been stuck on that station for nine months. I wouldn't mind somewhere with activity. I know just the place. Here you are, sir. Thank you. You're welcome. Ever tried muskan seed punch? It nearly made me sick. You have to be raised on it. It's nutritious. The taste grows on you. You speak Haliian! We travelled a lot when I was a kid. I picked up a couple of languages. We never travelled. My family lived in the same house for five generations. The one on the hill. How do you know about that? Well, to be honest, when we thought you were dead, I needed to review your logs and... personal correspondence for any possible clues about what happened. All of it? Most of it, yeah. You need to understand, we thought you'd been murdered. We needed information. I'm sorry. It's just that I tell my sister things I wouldn't tell anyone else. I guess I was feeling a little... exposed. I'd feel the same way. Especially if I had seen you in that wig! It really wasn't you. I'm curious. Now that you've met me, am I what you expected? Actually, I... I'm not sure. The woman I saw in those logs is complicated. I think there's more to you than meets the eye. In what way? Well, your relationship with Lt Rocha, for example. He was only there for five days, yet there was plenty of friction. You seemed to delight in doing things that you knew would upset him. Why take on extra comm traffic when it would make him angry? Is this a personal question or part of a murder investigation? I don't know. Maybe both. Keith Rocha was obnoxious from the minute he reported to duty. He treated me as though I was beneath contempt. I felt like I had to battle him to hold my own. But I didn't want to see him dead. Why do you think he attacked you? I don't know. Rocha's file is spotless. Two decorations for valour. Three outstanding commander's evaluations. Doesn't sound like the same man Lt Uhnari described. What did you find out about her? Her last posting was on Deriben V. Her commanding officer said she was argumentative, quick to take offence. He told me he transferred her to that relay station because she was ""hampering their efforts"". I'm having trouble believing her. Why? I sent Worf to check the weapons locker. There's a phaser missing. You think that she lied? Lied, conveniently forgot... I'm not sure. It's something we have to consider. As of now, we don't have sufficient evidence either way. I want you to examine her shuttle. You might find something to shed some light on her story. Aye, sir. How much longer will the investigation take? Three, maybe four days. It's tough to tell. I know I'm a suspect in the murder. But let me ask you something. You've watched my logs. You know me better than anyone here. Do I seem like a person who would murder someone? No, you don't. I don't think I realized how much I needed to hear that. Look, Aquiel, it's been a rough couple of days. You need some sleep. You called me complicated. You're right. I don't make friends easily. Oumriel. Oumriel. Commander! It is set to kill. We found this phaser in your craft. It was taken from the weapons locker. I don't remember what happened! Maybe I did make it to the weapons locker. It was set to level ten! Phasers are always set at level one when they're put in storage. That means that somebody deliberately changed the setting. Then there's your conflict with Lt Rocha. Rocha and I had our disagreements. That does not mean I would kill him. Have you been able to remember what happened? No. Nothing. I suppose maybe in self-defence I... To inflict the type of molecular damage found in Rocha's remains, it would take a sustained phaser discharge of 30 to 40 seconds. It doesn't sound like self-defence. Now wait a minute. We don't even know this phaser is the murder weapon. And even at level ten I don't see how it could have done that damage. A Klingon weapon, maybe... We're not making accusations. We want to find out what happened. Cmdr Morag is on his way. Let's hear his story. Fine. In the meantime, I'd like to try to access Rocha's personal logs again. Good idea. Geordi? Wait a second. Thank you, Mr. Worf. Aye, sir. This is off the record, said as a friend, not a superior officer. It would be best if you weren't so personally involved with Aquiel. There's a lot we don't know. There's a lot I do know. And if she's innocent, I want to help her prove it. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. I'm not the one making judgements. Got it! Computer, display the records of Lt Rocha from star dates 46455 to 46460. Computer, what happened to the log entries for stardate 46459? The logs have been deleted. Who deleted them? Unknown. Captain's log, supplemental. The Qu'Vat has arrived with Cmdr Morag. We're preparing to question him regarding the murder of Lt Rocha. I killed no one! We found your DNA on the bulkheads and the console. We know you were there! Answer their questions. Yes. Yes, I was there. My route takes me near the station every six days. Three days ago, I hailed them. There was no response. I was... concerned. Concerned? Yes. I went aboard to see what had happened. There was no one there, so I left. Is that all? That's all. Cmdr Morag, we found the encrypted message bank has been tampered with. Analysis indicates that 27 priority Starfleet messages are missing. What of it? Your DNA was found on the message-control module. This is outrageous! We will not tolerate these accusations. This is a diplomatic matter, Morag! Do not make me search your ship. Yes. I did take the messages. Did you kill Lt Rocha? No! I killed no one. There was no one there. I took the codes but I killed no one. Governor, we would like Cmdr Morag to remain on board until this investigation is completed. Take him. This way. Last night, after I dropped you off, you established a subspace link with this console. You deleted some of Rocha's files, didn't you? Yes, I did. Why? I found a letter Rocha planned to send to Starfleet Command about me. It said I had become belligerent and insubordinate. He was going to ask for a formal hearing. Geordi, I know how this looks. Yeah, it looks bad. You've erased a letter containing a possible motivation for murder? I didn't kill him. Then explain this! I was afraid if they found the letter they'd blame me for the murder. I'm not a model officer. I realize that. Sometimes I act on impulse instead of thinking things through. Aquiel, this really complicates things. What are you doing? Getting out of here. Running won't prove your innocence. Facing this will. I'm scared, Geordi! Look. We'll get through this. I promise you, OK? Then you believe me? Yes, I do. Medical Officer's log. I've isolated the cellular residue from the deck, but the DNA has destabilized. I'm attempting to reform it. Alright, initiate the resonance frequency burst. I'm beginning to get a stable DNA scan. This is odd. The nucleotide sequences are beginning to fluctuate. The DNA is becoming mobile. Let's try another frequency burst. Increase the resonance level by 20%. I haven't been this close to someone in a long time. I don't want to let go of it. Neither do I but we've got 600 logs to go through. Alright. But first there's something I want to share with you. What? A way that we can become more intimate. My people are partially telepathic. We use something called the Canar to help focus our thoughts. We also use the Canar for a stronger emotional link during love. I was wondering what that was for. Do both of us have to be telepathic for it to work? Let's find out. Like this. Think of me. An exact reproduction of my hand, right down to the DNA structure. This was formed from the organic matter taken from the deck plates? When I infused it with a resonance-frequency burst it activated its DNA. Then it touched my hand and it began to mimic my cellular structure. What exactly is this? This sounds far-fetched, but have you ever heard of a coalescent organism? No. They're microscopic life forms which absorb other organisms to survive. That in itself isn't so unusual, but coalescents become the organisms, right down to the cellular level. Is this what happened with your hand? There have been reports that these organisms can be quite large. What happened to my hand seems to support that. Was Rocha killed by one of these organisms? It's possible that something happened to him before he reported for duty. I do not understand. I've checked the records. Before he was posted to the station, Rocha served in the Triona system. That is a remote sector. Maybe he was absorbed by a coalescent on that mission. So, there could have been an organism that looked and acted like Lt Rocha? How often do they have to change bodies? The microscopic organisms have a cycle of no more than ten seconds. We can only assume that a larger, more complex coalescent would have a cycle of days, even weeks. If that's true, then Rocha attacked Lt Uhnari to find a new body. Right. That means Uhnari is a coalescent. There was one other person on the station. Morag. It is possible he was the one who was... absorbed. Computer, locate Cmdr Morag and Lt Uhnari. Cmdr Morag is in his quarters. Lt Uhnari is not on the Enterprise. Where did she go? Lt Uhnari transported to Relay Station 47 at 1830 hours. Get Morag. I'll go to the station. Aye, sir. Geordi? I can see you! And I can feel you. Do not move! What is this? You will come with me. You've never been as close to someone as you are about to be. Think of me. Step away from him, Lieutenant. What are you doing, Commander? That may not be Lt Uhnari. What? What are you saying? Step away, now. Medical Officer's log. Cmdr Morag and Lt Uhnari are being kept under close observation. So far no sign of coalescent behaviour has surfaced. Aquiel and Morag will be transferred to a secure hospital on Starbase 12. We'll know more once we're there. Yeah? Right. It could be Morag. We don't know for sure. Sure. Get some rest. You've had a rough couple of days. Thanks. Computer. Display the Engineering duty roster for the next three days. Not now. I said, not now. Give me a break here! Go lay down! Maura? Maybe the reason you don't remember anything is that the coalescing process had begun. Thank you. You said you felt your memories had been drained out of you. That's probably exactly what was going on. Maybe I did take the phaser. Whatever happened, at least you got away before the process took hold. So he turned on Maura. Right. Well, ... what now? I guess I'll be going to Starbase 212 for reassignment. I had a talk with Chief Pendleton in Communications. There's an opening for a level-two specialist. Really? With the waiting list, I'd be grey before I got here. I could put in a good word. It's an appealing offer, but I think I'd rather get here on my own merits. Don't be surprised if you see my name on that list. (ENGLISH) "
S6E14,"Computer, lights. Computer, turn on the lights. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Good, you're awake. Who are you?. Please, Counsellor. There is little time. The Commander will be calling for you. Where am I? Aboard the Romulan War bird Khazara. I am Subcommander N'Vek. War bird? I was at the... neuropsychology seminar at Bokara VI. The last thing I remember was returning to my quarters. I was attacked. I felt a hypospray. It was necessary. I could not be certain you would come voluntarily. Oh, God. My head's still spinning. The drugs have nearly dissipated. The disorientation will pass. Why have you brought me here? Listen to me. You are no longer Deanna Troi. You are Major Rakal of the Tal Shiar, Imperial Intelligence. Cmdr Toreth... Am I a prisoner? There is no time to explain it all. Cmdr Toreth will want to know your mission. Tell her nothing. Simply instruct her to proceed to the Kaleb Sector. Heading 102 mark four. The Kaleb Sector?. Repeat it. Heading 102 mark four. Heading 102 mark four. And she'll take orders from me? You are a Tal Shiar officer. She will obey you, but do not push her too far. We are approaching the loading point. Bring our guest to the bridge. Yes, Commander. Immediately. Please. Hurry. I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on. You are a Starfleet officer disguised as a Romulan. Unless you trust me and do exactly as I have said, Toreth will discover you and you will be killed. How do I know I won't be killed anyway? Your only chance to get off this ship alive is to do as I say. You are an empath. You would know if I am lying. Am I? No. Then let us go see the Commander. Orbit established, Commander. Commence loading of cargo. Notify me when it is complete. Yes, sir. Commander, may I present Major Rakal of the Tal Shiar? This is Cmdr Toreth. Attend to your station. Why are you here without your guards? Well? The mission is one of utmost secrecy. I could not risk bringing guards. And what exactly is the nature of this clandestine assignment? I cannot reveal that. Why not? I am under orders. You don't act like a member of the Tal Shiar. How long have you been with them? Several months. Commander, cargo is on board and secure. Tell me, why should a commander be kept ignorant of her ship's cargo? I don't know what you mean. I have orders to take on cargo, but its contents are unknown to me. Does that seem wise? I am responsible for the safety of this ship and its crew. How do I know this cargo is safe to transport? I'm sure it is safe or it would not have been loaded. The Tal Shiar is deeply concerned for the safety and well-being of the military. I'm sure that every person on the bridge could offer testimony about personal experiences with the Tal Shiar, but I doubt many could recall those encounters as tender and caring. So forgive me if I hesitate to accept your assurances that that cargo presents no danger to my crew. I intend to open those containers. That cargo is the property of the Tal Shiar. You will not touch it. On whose authority? Mine. If you do not wish to undergo another ""experience"" with the Tal Shiar, I suggest you not question me again. Now... proceed on course, bearing 102 mark four, to the Kaleb Sector. Why there? It's virtually deserted. Because those are your orders. Pilot, set course. 102 mark 4. Warp six. Yes, Commander. Captain's log, stardate 465 19. 1. We are at Research Station 75 to take on a rather unique passenger, one whose homecoming will undoubtedly be difficult. The man is a dishonourable traitor. He risked his life to get here on a scout ship. That does not excuse his actions. Maybe he finally realized he made a mistake. It's 20 years too late. Energize. Ensign DeSeve, by order of Starfleet Command I arrest you for treason. I... understand. After you are declared fit, you will be confined to quarters until a court martial is convened. Find civilian clothes instead of that uniform. Yes, sir. Commander, I must speak with Capt Picard. He's a busy man. Please. It's important. Urgent. I'll tell him. Commander. At ease. It's ""Captain"", actually. Of course. Sorry, sir. You said it was important. Yes, Captain. I have a message from Ambassador Spock. He said it involves further... ""cowboy diplomacy"", that you would understand. A Corvallen freighter is arriving in the Kaleb Sector in 12 hours. Spock wants you to... rendezvous... with that ship, bring its cargo back to Federation space. What kind of cargo? He said it was... ..important. To the future of the Romulans and the Federation. You have returned in order to give me this message? Partly. To know whether Ambassador Spock's message is being delivered accurately I need to understand something about the messenger. I was... ready to come back. Romulus had lost its appeal. At one time you found it very appealing. The Romulans are very moral, Captain. They have an absolute certainty about right and wrong, who is a friend and who is an enemy, a strict moral compass which provides them with a clarity of purpose. At one time I found their sense of purpose, their passion and commitment, to be very compelling. But not any more? As I've grown older, I realize that clarity of purpose is a more... ..ambiguous matter than I had thought in my youth. Cmdr Riker, set a course for the Kaleb Sector, warp factor eight. Aye-aye, sir. You may wait outside. Make certain we're not disturbed. They're terrified of me. The purpose of the Tal Shiar is to ensure loyalty. To defy them is to invite imprisonment. Or death. It's time you told me what this is all about. That is why I called you here. These are the cargo containers. What's in it? He's alive. In stasis. Who is it? Vice Proconsul M'ret of the Imperial Senate and his two top aides. He's one of the highest-ranking members of the Romulan government. His defection will be a great blow to Romulus. Why is he doing this? He questioned government repression and was in danger of imprisonment. He will take this risk in order to protest Romulan policy and support the dissident movement. You're part of Spock's underground movement. Yes. If we are able to deliver M'ret safely, we hope to create an escape route for dissidents who fear for their lives. Now you realize why we are willing to go to such lengths, even kidnapping you, to make sure we succeed. You've given me the identity of a Tal Shiar officer. Is there a real Major Rakal? There was. She was killed for you to take her place. Only a member of the Tal Shiar would be able to alter a ship's mission. Why me? A Romulan could have played this role. Yes. For the first part of the plan. But if anything goes wrong, we will need a Starfleet officer. Why? There's no need to go into that unless it becomes necessary. For your own sake, the less you know about this plan, the better. What is your plan? At the Kaleb Sector we'll rendezvous with a Corvallen freighter. You will take these containers into their ship and return to Starfleet. The Corvallens are mercenaries. Do they know what's in these? No. They will simply take you to Federation space. Very well. We are due in the wardroom shortly. Senior officers always dine together. I'll go to my quarters. I'd prefer to stay out of the Commander's way. No. You will be expected to attend. Follow me after a few moments. Cmdr Toreth must not feel that anything is unusual. We'd been told that the Klingon outpost was undefended, so when the warships decloaked... they took us completely by surprise. They destroyed half my squadron before we even opened fire. But when we did... They were no match for us. I destroyed their flagship myself. I received the Sotaric citation for my actions that day. The intelligence officer in charge of that mission was executed. Major. Welcome to our table. Commander. I suggest you try the viinerine. It's quite good. I realize it's nothing compared to what you're used to on Romulus, but you could at least try it. I've smelled better viinerine on prison ships. No doubt. Tell me, Major, where did you train? The Intelligence Academy or the Imperial War College? The Academy. So you must know Cmdr Konsab. I know of him. I assume you studied history with him. Yes. Tell me, Major, what do you think about his theories on the differences between the military and the Tal Shiar? Which aspects? Come now, Major. Surely you attended his classes regularly. It was his main theme. Do you have a point to make, Commander? If so, it has escaped me. Cmdr Konsab believes that in order to function, military officers have to trust each other. The Tal Shiar, on the other hand, trust no one. They expect deception, so they always find it. Your opinion of the Tal Shiar is quite clear, Commander. I hope so. We ensure the loyalty of the people. Do you believe the Empire would be better off without our protection? Protection. From what? How was the Empire threatened by the words of an old man, a devoted citizen who merely tried to speak his mind? How did the Tal Shiar protect the Empire by dragging him, my father, out of his home in the middle of the night? Clearly, your father was a traitor. No. He was just an idealistic old man. I never saw him again. I don't need your devotion, Commander. Just your obedience. And that's all you have. Commander, sensors are picking up an unknown ship on an intercept course. What is the configuration? A freighter. Hail them. Visual. Commander, we are glad to see you. We are prepared to transfer your cargo as agreed. With whom do you have this agreement? Our arrangements were made with Major Rakal. Rest assured your cargo will be taken safely to its destination. We will transmit coordinates for you to beam it aboard. He's lying. They don't intend to keep their word. Are you certain? Yes. Why did you destroy that vessel? I beg forgiveness, Commander, but Major Rakal ordered me to fire. The freighter is destroyed. There are no survivors. I demand an explanation. How many people were on that ship? Approximately 18 people, sir. I don't care if there were 18 or 800. On this ship, I give the command to fire, Major. You have no right... This gives me the right. Even you, eventually, will have to answer to someone. You will be held accountable. I have been given broad discretionary powers. Subcommander N'Vek acted under my authority, that of the Tal Shiar. I assure you, this action will not be questioned. But I will enter in my log that I am not responsible for those 18 lives and that I deplore their loss. Do whatever you feel is necessary. In the meantime, we must protect ourselves. Engage the cloaking device. And what are my orders now, Major? Hold position and wait. There is no sign of the freighter. We are the only ship in the area. Ensign, verify our position. Holding at the coordinates specified by Ensign DeSeve. Long-range sensors? No other ships within three light years. Could this have been a hoax? It's one possibility. Mr. Worf, bring Ensign DeSeve to my ready room. Ensign, you promised me a freighter with an important cargo. All that is here is empty space. Do you have an explanation? I don't understand. Captain, he has deceived us. No. I was told the ship would be at these coordinates. You said that the message came directly from Ambassador Spock. Yes. Well... not exactly. And what does that mean? Someone else gave the message to me, but he said Spock spoke to him. I trust the man who spoke to me. He would not have lied. Was he a Romulan? Yes. He's part of the underground, a dissident. He risks his life to work with those who want a different future. He could be leading us into a trap. No, that is not so. It would be risky to set a trap here, so close to Federation space. But the fact remains, here we are, there is no freighter. What else did your contact tell you? The freighter is an old Antares-class vessel with limited speed and range. It couldn't have taken on its cargo more than a day ago, so it must be within... 15 light years of here. Why didn't you mention this earlier? It didn't seem necessary. On Romulus, you learn not to volunteer information. It's a hard habit to break. Maybe now would be a good time to start. Follow me, gentlemen. Our plan has collapsed. Our plan? What about the people on that freighter? Why did you fire? There was no alternative. You said they couldn't be trusted. The mission would have been in jeopardy. 18 people lost their lives. Don't lecture me. A number of people have died to carry out this mission. Believe me, those 18 won't be the last. I'm sorry, but I can't dismiss those lives so easily. Fine. Agonize all you want. But don't let it sabotage our plan. You don't have a plan any more. I told you if anything went wrong, we would need a Starfleet officer. There is a Starfleet base on Draken IV, two days away at maximum warp. That's where we're going. In a Romulan ship? Yes. It's your job to order Toreth to proceed into Federation territory. We'll never get through the gravidic-sensor nets. We will... if you provide the correct access codes. Do you really think this has a chance of succeeding? If you have another idea, I'll be happy to consider it. You will plot a course for the Draken System. You can't be serious. Draken IV was the freighter's destination. I ordered it destroyed because I recognized the captain, a known spy. Now we must deliver the cargo ourselves. We must...? I will not explain myself to you. You will set a course. In order to reach Draken we will have to travel through Federation space for nearly 20 hours. That is not a problem. Contrary to the propaganda you would have us believe Starfleet is neither weak nor foolish. The chances of us reaching Draken undetected are not good. We will be cloaked. Cloaking does not always make us invulnerable. You would know that if you had spent time in the field. The Federation's borders are full of listening posts, gravidic sensors. They may even have a tachyon grid, in which case they'll know we're there. If we are discovered in Federation territory, it will be interpreted as an act of war. The Tal Shiar has obtained access codes to the sensor nets. I will provide them if necessary. That will be no guarantee that we will escape undetected. Your cowardice does not befit a Romulan soldier. People blame the military for the wars that we are asked to fight, ... ..but I think it is your kind, Major, that will be the death of us all. Plot a course for the Draken System. Course plotted, sir. Prepare for warp. Sensors are picking up a vessel. Cloaking is still engaged. They have not detected us. Activate view screen. Enlarge. It is the Enterprise, Commander. Well, Major, it appears your suspicions about the freighter were correct after all. The Federation has come in search of its spies. Status? They are scanning the debris of the freighter. Shield levels normal. Weapons systems not active. They are not prepared for battle. They weren't expecting to find us. And I shan't alter that perception. The radiation from the debris field could make our cloak detectable. Proceed at manoeuvring speed. One moment, Commander. We should hold our position until the ship leaves the area. We cannot risk detection. Even if we are detected, they cannot track us in warp. We have not established their intentions. Their intentions are obvious and are of no concern to us. Proceed on course. Manoeuvring engines only. Go to warp when we are clear of the debris field. We should clear the field in 27 minutes. You will keep me informed of our progress. It is not wise to challenge the Tal Shiar, Commander. I will not let her tell me how to run my ship. It seems to be the remains of a ship, an Antares-class freighter. That's the ship we were meant to meet. Could there have been a malfunction? A reactor-core breach? I do not believe so. It would not be consistent with the debris pattern. However, sensors indicate extremely high levels of residual antiprotons. Romulan disruptor fire. Correct. The decay rate suggests the incident occurred within the last 4.3 hours. Then Romulans could still be in the area. Red alert. Shields at maximum. Whatever that freighter was carrying, they didn't want it to reach us. Sure you don't know what it was? No, sir, I swear it. All we have here are questions. Mr. Data, continue with your scan. We have to get a message to the Enterprise. That's impossible. It's the perfect opportunity. They are nearby. If we communicate with them, maybe they can help us. Counsellor, this ship is travelling under cloak. All electromagnetic emissions are being monitored. Any attempt at all at communication and we would be discovered instantly. It could not succeed. Continuing to Draken IV is the safest course. Is there anything you can do to the ship or the cloaking device that would let the Enterprise track us? Track us? No. We want to get into Federation territory undetected. What we want is to get the dissidents to safety. Now answer the question. Is there a way? If there were, I wouldn't do it. Yes, you will. Counsellor... We're playing it my way now. I've been kidnapped, surgically altered, put in danger... I've gone along with all your plans. Now you are going to listen to me. You find a way to let the Enterprise track us or I will go to Toreth and tell her I've discovered you're a traitor. I'll have you ejected into space. Is that clear, Subcommander? There is one possibility. In order for a ship to remain undetectable while cloaked, the radiative emissions from the warp engines must be precisely balanced. The ship's engineer is a sympathiser. He may be able to slightly misalign one of the n'livia cores, It would create a magnetic disruption in space whenever we were in motion. Good. Do it. The effect would be intermittent. They might not even detect it. If it's the best we can do, we have to try it. Anything more would be registered on the bridge. Even this slight misalignment may be detected. It's a risk we have to take. You're the one that outlined the stakes to me, N'Vek. Are you getting squeamish just when it's getting a little more dangerous? Sensors are picking up a magnetic distortion to our port side. Analysis. The distortion is extremely weak. It appears to be moving slowly. It... It is gone, sir. Gone? The distortion no longer registers on our instruments. Could this distortion be caused by a cloaked ship? Unknown, sir. Our understanding of Romulan technology is still limited. Captain, Romulan ships use a quantum singularity as a power source. If it is not functioning perfectly or is damaged even slightly, it might show through the cloak as a magnetic disturbance. The distortion has reappeared, sir, bearing 337 mark 10. It... It has disappeared again, sir. Mr. DeSeve, in your opinion, could we be picking up a cloaked Romulan ship? It's a strong possibility. Mr. Data, continue scanning. Ensign, link navigation to Mr. Data's console. And... plot a course for that distortion. The Enterprise is underway. Good. What is their course? They're heading for us, sir. What? They appear to be on an intercept course. What is the status of our cloaking device? Is there some malfunction? Device functioning correctly. All emissions within proper range. Maintain full sensor scans. Commander. The Enterprise may simply be searching. Perhaps. Where is it now, Mr. Data? It has disappeared once again, sir. It may have been coming to a halt. Stop engines. If this is a Romulan ship, will it wait until we leave? I don't think so. A Romulan commander's instinct is to attack. Engage manoeuvring engines, forward 0.1 . Take us directly under their hull. Yes, Commander. What are you doing? It seems that the Enterprise can track us even though we are cloaked. I intend to find out if they can or they cannot. N'Vek, ready attack procedure. Sir, disruptors are standing by, ready to disengage cloak. We cannot risk an engagement here. Considering our mission, I would have preferred to avoid it as well. But I see no other alternative. What do you intend to do? We will pass as close as we possibly can. If they have the ability to track us, they will move to avoid a collision. If they do, I will destroy them. Sir, the magnetic distortion has reappeared. Bearing and speed? It appears to be moving toward us, closing slowly. Its bearing indicates a collision course. Time to impact? I cannot get a precise measurement, but I estimate impact in 90 seconds. It doesn't make sense. Why would they run into us? And why do it at full speed? I don't know, sir. The Romulans only make suicide attacks as a last resort. There's no reason for it here. Time to impact, 60 seconds. We don't have the luxury to speculate. Back us away, Ensign, One-half impulse. Aye, sir. They are moving away. Prepare attack sequence. Ready for battle, Commander. Disruptors charged. Disengage cloak on my command. Prepare to fire. Disregard that order. What? I do not authorize this attack. Cease battle operations immediately. I do not need your authorization to attack, Major. This is my ship. How typical of the military to resort to brute force when discretion is required. The Enterprise can clearly track us. They must be destroyed. Yes, they can track us. So if we attack them, they will return fire. And since we have no shields when we're cloaked, they will destroy us. Are you questioning my ability to command? You are not fit to command. Step down. Step down or I will have you removed. Do you think anyone here will listen to you? If any of you defies the Tal Shiar, you will not bear the punishment alone. Your families, all of them, will be there beside you. I am now commander of this ship. Take orders from me and no one else. Remove Cmdr Toreth from her station. If she resists... shoot her. Commander, please. Step down. Remove her weapon. Now, Commander, watch and learn. In order to defeat your enemy, you must first understand them. The Federation wishes to avoid war at all costs, so I will offer them a diplomatic solution, get them to lower their shields, and then... destroy them. Captain, we are being hailed. On screen. I am Major Rakal of the ""Tal Shiar"". I'm Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. How can we be of help? A Corvallen freighter has been destroyed not far from here. We have detected the residual effects of disruptor fire. Can you shed any light on this? A regrettable incident, Captain. The freighter was fired upon by the former commander of this vessel. I have now taken control and I assure you there will be no more attacks. Still, there was considerable loss of life. Captain, we do not want to ex aggerate this incident. You and I can discuss it calmly. We can... defuse it before it becomes inflated. I agree. I will come onto your ship. Please lower your shields and prepare to beam me aboard. Very well. Mr. Worf, lock on to Major Rakal, transport on my command. Aye, sir. Thank you. What's she doing on that ship? I don't know, Number One. But she needs our help to get back. Mr. Worf, keep that lock on her, no matter what. Yes, sir. Lower shields. Their shields are dropping. Activate forward-disruptor array. Fire when ready. Yes, Major. Firing. They have fired on us. Shields up. Stand by phasers. Damage report. Direct hit, but negligible damage. The disruptor had almost no power. It's Proconsul M'ret and his aides. From the underground movement. They're in stasis. Medical team, to the bridge. Where's Deanna? The Enterprise was not damaged. They have re-established shields. Malfunction in the disruptor array. The power system has destabilized. The disruptor beam has been sabotaged to conceal a transporter beam within. Quickly, Pilot, locate transport coordinates. What have you done? The transporter beam originated in our cargo bay. Something was beamed to the Enterprise. So, Major, the mysterious cargo, brought on board by Major Rakal of the Tal Shiar, has been transported to the Starfleet vessel. I see two traitors in our midst. So, Major. Now you can no longer take refuge behind the shield of the Tal Shiar, it's time to answer a few questions. What was in those cargo containers? Well, no matter. We will soon know all that we need to know, then we will execute you. Pilot, drop shields and cloak the ship. Prepare to go to warp. Aye, sir. Mr. Worf, now. Counsellor... Are you alright? Yes. Let's get you to sickbay. Get us out of here. Warp nine. Aye, sir. That about does it. How does it feel to have your own face back? Just right. Thank you. The men you rescued are all safe. Proconsul M'ret is deeply grateful. The thanks should go to N'Vek. He sacrificed himself to save them. And me. Thanks to the two of you, the way has been paved for further rescue operations. N'Vek's efforts, and his sacrifice, were not in vain. (ENGLISH) "
S6E15,"Bring the status units in here, on line. Dr Selar can use ward three and I'll stay here. Sickbay, they're coming in now. Acknowledged. Be ready. Let's go. Get him on here. What happened? The Lenarians attacked us outside the conference room. He's in cardiac arrest. Connect the pulmonary support units. Internal haemorrhaging. The regulator of his artificial heart is fused. He's got liver and spleen damage. What kind of weapon caused it? A compressed tetryon beam. 40cc inaprovaline. The activity in the isocortex is falling. Cortical stimulators. Now. Again. His respiratory system is shutting down. Levels in the isocortex are still falling. Damn! Prepare for... Welcome to the afterlife, Jean-Luc. You're dead. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Q, what is going on? I told you. You're dead. This is the afterlife and I'm God. You are not God! Blasphemy. You're lucky I don't cast you out or smite you. The bottom line is, your life ended about five minutes ago, under the inept ministrations of Dr Beverly Crusher. No. I am not dead. Because I refuse to believe that the afterlife is run by you. The universe is not so badly designed. Very well. If you require more evidence of your postmortem status, I'll provide you some. Jean-Luc, I told you not to go to that Academy. Father. I told you Starfleet would bring you to a bad end, but you wouldn't listen. Now look at you. Dead before your time. Q, enough of this. Enough what? Why couldn't you have listened? Didn't you know that I worked for your best interests? Q, stop this. After all these years, even now, you manage to disappoint me, Jean-Luc. He's not the only one who'd like a word with you. Jean-Luc, why did you do it? There are people down there! There must be another way. They're firing on us. If you continue on this course... Direct hit. These are the voices of all the people you've killed. Whom I've killed? What do you mean? Death has made you a little dim. These are the voices of all the people who have died through your actions or inactions. If you have any words of apology or regret, I believe they're all listening. They're a surly bunch, so don't drag it out. I won't perform for your amusement. It's not for me. It's for you. It's an opportunity to make peace with your sordid past. I can't believe you'd do this for my soul. Now that you've shuffled off the mortal coil we can spend a little time together. A little time together? How much? Eternity. You're sure you have no regrets or guilt about your former life? I can't have you whining and complaining through time. If I'm really dead, then my only regret is dying and finding you here. You wound me. After all, I was not the cause of your death. This was. Is that...? Your artificial heart. You might have lived if you had a real one, instead of this unreliable technology. By the way, how did you lose yours? A mistake. Is that a regret? I regret many things from those days. Really? It wasn't very smart of you to take on three Nausicaans, was it? No, it wasn't. And did I hear a laugh? It's so unlike you to have a sense of humour, especially about getting stabbed through the back. I was different in those days. Arrogant, undisciplined, with far too much ego. And too little wisdom. I was more like you. Then, you must have been far more interesting. Pity you had to change. The pity is, I had to be impaled through the back before I learned that lesson. I started that fight with those Nausicaans. I started it because... Because I was young and cocky. If I'd been more responsible, I wouldn't have needed this heart. I wouldn't have died from a random energy surge 30 years later. So, if you had to do it all over again? Things would be different. Bravo. Nicely done. Cortin. Cortin Zweller. Yes. Boy, she must have hit you pretty hard! You deserved it. You're slowing down, Johnny. You should have seen that one coming. Marta Batanides. Are you OK? Yes, I'm fine. I'm just a little disoriented, that's all. He's playing for sympathy now. I'm gonna eat, then go to the casino at Bonestell. You coming? I'll catch up with you there. You sure you're OK? Yes, I'm fine. Really, Marta, I'm fine. Come on, Marty. I bet he's got another date. That's it, isn't it? You are incorrigible. Attention on deck, Ensign Picard! Q. That's Capt Q to you, young man. What is the point of creating this fantasy? This is no fantasy, I assure you. It's all very real. You're 21 years old again. A brash young man, fresh out of the Academy. I certainly don't look it. Well, to everyone else you do. So, Q, I thought you told me that I was dead? Now it seems I'm alive. You mortals are so obtuse. How can you believe life and death are such static and rigid concepts? I can take your life and give it back to you again with the snap of a finger. Let's say that may be true. What is the purpose in bringing me here? You said you regretted many things. Here's a chance to change some of them. Change them? You mean change the past? Even if you have been able to bring me back in time somehow, you know that an alteration in this timeline will have a profound impact on the future. Please! Spare me your egotistical musings on your pivotal role in history. Nothing you do here will cause galaxies to explode. To be blunt, you're not that important. I won't do it. I won't alter history. Very well! Since you attach so much importance to the continuity of time, ... ..I give you my personal guarantee that nothing you do here will hurt anyone or have an adverse effect on what you know of as history. The only thing at stake here is your life and peace of mind. Now, whether you believe me or not, you are here. And you have a second chance. What you choose to do with it is entirely up to you. Do you know where you are? Starbase Earhart. We came here right after graduation to await our first deep-space assignments. That's right. It's two days before your encounter with a Nausicaan sword. You have that long to make whatever changes you wish. If you can avoid getting stabbed this time, which I doubt, I will take you back to what you think of as the present. And you will go on with your life with a real heart. Then, I won't die? Of course you'll die. It'll just be at a later time. What if I don't avoid the fight? What if I won't make the changes? Then, you die on the table and we spend eternity together. Wonderful. I'm glad you think so. I'm curious about one thing, Johnny. Why did that attractive woman strike you just now? Something you said? Her name was Corlina. I'd arranged to take her out today. Then she discovered that I had already made a second date with another woman called... ..Penny. And Corlina was, naturally, upset. I'd no idea you were such a cad. I'm impressed. Computer, what is the time now? 16 11 hours. In fact, Penny is waiting for me, right now. Well, ... carry on. Well, you're awfully quiet today. What happened to that dashing young ensign from last night? The one with the winning smile and the smooth talk about my eyes. I'm just a little more contemplative. And what are you contemplating? Penny... Do you think we could talk for a while? I hardly know you. Where you're from, what your interests are, your last name. I come from Rigel, my last name is Muroc and I like men in uniform. I think that's enough talking. What's wrong? I don't look as attractive as I did last night? No. Not at all. I think you're a very handsome woman. Handsome? That's something you say to old ladies. You're certainly not an old lady. I didn't want your pity. Penny for your thoughts. You never told me you were such a ladies' man. I wasn't. I was a puerile adolescent led by his hormones instead of his head. Your friends know how to have fun. You ought to take lessons. Excuse me. He's winning. Of course. I thought you had a date. She decided to leave. You're getting old, Johnny. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. Very, very nice. Forget Starfleet and play dom-jot for a living. This is nothing. A little trigonometry, some wrist action. Now, barokie, there's a game. Human! Play dom-jot, human. I think I could be persuaded to play one more game. Corey, don't play him. Why? Itll cause trouble. He's a Nausicaan. They can get very ill-tempered if they lose. So can I. No, listen to me. This is a mistake. Don't play him. What's gotten into you? Let's go. I see you've found your Nausicaan friend. You seem unimpaled so far. I'm sorry to disappoint you. Get him, Corey. Ensign Zweller seems to be doing well. He's gonna lose. The Nausicaan is cheating. Really? I'm beginning to like these Nausicaans. If history repeats itself, Corey will figure it out later tonight, and then he'll want revenge. And will you help your best friend avenge this injustice? I did last time. I rigged the table so that he would win in a rematch. Picard, you cheated? I'm impressed. It was a stupid mistake. The Nausicaan didn't take kindly to losing. Nor his friends. They were outraged. They wanted a fight. I gave them one. That's a beautiful story. It gets you right here, doesn't it? Ten! Dom-jot. Human play dom-jot. I've played a lot of dom-jot. I've never seen balls roll that well for anyone. So, he was cheating? I bet he had a magnetic device. It was controlling the balls. That's terrible. We gotta get even. What did you have in mind? Well, we can do to him what he did to us. Cheat. This time, we rig the table so his device will backfire on him. That won't solve anything. It'll teach him not to go round cheating Starfleet officers. All it'll do is provoke him. And provoking a Nausicaan is not a good idea. I can handle him. What if he brings some of his Nausicaan friends? That's when I'll have to depend on my friends to help me out. Corey, there's got to be a better way to handle this. When did you start backing away from a good fight? Look, we're not cadets any more. We're officers. We should set a higher standard for ourselves. It was a good idea but let's just forget it, OK? He'll get over it. I hope so. What? Nothing. It's just you'd usually be the one plotting revenge. Yes. That would be more in character, wouldn't it? Much. I always suspected you had a hidden streak of responsibility. Perhaps it's just that I'm getting older. Maybe these bars are starting to feel a little heavy, Ensign. Ensign Picard and Ensign Batanides. It sounds weird, doesn't it? It's going to take some getting used to. It's too bad we can't get used to it together. Well, the three of us, I mean. Of course. Come. Flowers! Is there a John-Luck Pickard here? From one of your conquests, no doubt. I guess some things aren't going to change. Did I interrupt anything sordid, I hope? No, Q, you did not. Pity. She's quite attractive. We were friends. Nothing more. Is that another regret I hear? My, my. We're riddled with regrets about our youth, aren't we? My friendship with Marta is not something I regret. But you wish it had been more than friendship? Well, maybe you can change all that. Q, what is it you want? You should know Mr. Zweller has decided not to take your advice. He's in the Bonestell Facility rigging the table to beat the Nausicaan. I guess you weren't that persuasive. Corey. Don't sneak up on me. I thought you were the foreman. Sorry. I'm glad you're here. Hand me that magnaspanner. I'm not here to help. I'm here to stop you from making a serious mistake. You sound like my mother. Cheating the Nausicaans could have consequences for all of us. It's too big a risk. You are my mother! Gee, Mom, I'll tell those Nausicaans I don't mind if they cheat me. This is not a joke. It better be. Now, I'm gonna finish my work here. If you wanna help me, fine. If not, I'll see you at the star base. I said you're not doing this. Are you gonna hit me, Johnny? No. I'll tell the gambling foreman someone tampered with his table. Alright. Have it your way, Ensign Picard. I just couldn't make him understand. At least he finally did give it up. But he didn't take it well. You know Corey. He'll forget all about it by tomorrow. I hope you're right, because he and I were friends for years after this. I mean, I hope we will be. You know, ... ..you keep smiling at me. Well, I've just never seen you like this before. You're so serious. Do I really seem that different? Maybe I'm just not used to seeing you in your officer's uniform. No, it's more than that. You do seem different. Well, I'm not complaining or anything. I think it suits you. Really? Yes. It's very attractive. Johnny. Haven't you ever thought about us getting together? Yes, I have, actually. I've thought about it for a long time. Why didn't you ever say so? I don't know. And at this moment, ... ..I really have no idea why not. You've said so now. Morning, darling. Feeling a little jumpy this morning? Are we guilty, perhaps? I don't feel guilty about anything, Q. No? ""We're just friends, Q. Nothing more."" And we're still friends. So, what's next? I don't know. What I do know is, things will be different. I'm sure. Good morning. Johnny. What's wrong? Well, this is the morning after. Look, I don't regret anything that happened last night. I hope you don't either. I don't know. We've been friends for a long time... ..and now... ..Im afraid we've ruined that friendship. Then, perhaps we should... ..forget about what happened and try to... I wish I could. It would be much easier to say goodbye tomorrow. We're all supposed to get together later for our last big night out before we all ship out. Don't do anything that makes you uncomfortable. We've planned it. I'll be there. Well, let's see. You've managed to get slapped by one woman, a drink thrown in your face by another, and alienate your two best friends. Doing well so far. The only thing left to avoid is getting stabbed through the heart. I think you'll like the Ajax. I hear that Capt Narth is an excellent officer. So I hear. Well, here's to the class of '27. Play dom-jot, human. Give you a better chance. Give you a bigger stick maybe. I don't think we're interested. They are undari. Cowards! What did you say? Coward. Like all Starfleet. You talk and you talk, but you have no guramba. Why don't we find out? Don't be a fool. Play dom-jot with someone else. Just go about your business. Maybe I play with her. Give her a good time. Starfleet! I'm sorry, Corey. He was reaching for a weapon. I don't know who you are any more, but you're not my friend. Goodbye, Johnny. Congratulations, mon capitaine. You did it. Can I help you, Mr. Picard? Mr. Worf. This is not for me. Take it to Cmdr La Forge in Engineering. What's happened? Is something wrong? I'm not sure. Mr. Worf, what is my rank and position? You are lieutenant junior grade, Assistant Astrophysics Officer. Are you feeling alright? Who's the captain of this ship? Capt Thomas Halloway. Perhaps I should escort you to sickbay. No. I can find my own way there. Thank you, Commander. Beverly, something's happened. I'm not sure... Well, well, well. What seems to be the trouble, Leutnant Picard? Q, what have you done? I've done exactly as I promised. I've returned you to the present. This is not the present I remember. You said nothing would change. Nothing has changed, Jean-Luc, except for you. But that's what you wanted. To change the man you were in your youth. You did it. This is the man you are today. And you should be happy. You have a real heart beating in your chest. You live out the rest of your life in safety, running tests, making analyses and carrying reports to your superiors. Excuse me, am I interrupting? No, not at all. Have a seat. Thank you. I'd like to talk to you about my future on the Enterprise. Of course, Lieutenant. Jean-Luc, isn't it? I should go. No. I would very much like to hear your thoughts. First of all, I would like you to be straightforward with me. How would you evaluate me as an officer? Well, your performance records have always been good. You're thorough, dedicated. Steady, reliable. Punctual. I see. What would you say if I told you that I believed that I was capable of being very much more? Let's discuss this at your next evaluation. I would appreciate discussing it now. You see, I feel that I would like to move beyond Astrophysics to Engineering or Security, something that might even lead to Command. Frankly, Lieutenant, I don't think that's realistic. Why? This isn't the place to discuss this. Please. This is very important to me. I believe that I can do more. Hasn't that been the problem all along? Throughout your career you've had lofty goals, but you've never been willing to do what's necessary to attain them. Would that be your evaluation? I agree with the Counsellor. To get ahead, take chances. Stand out in a crowd, get noticed. I see. We don't want to lose you. You're a good officer. Just not one who stands out. I'll talk to Cmdr La Forge in Engineering. But, Command? Well, ... we'll see. Senior officers, report to the Captain's ready room. Acknowledged. We should talk about this later. Alright, Q, that's enough. You've made your point. Q? La Forge to Lt Picard. I'm still waiting for that statistical analysis. I'm on my way. Main Engineering. Are you having a good laugh now, Q? Does it amuse you to think of me living out my life as a dreary man in a tedious job? I gave you something most mortals never experience. A second chance at life. And now all you can do is complain? I can't live out my days as that person. That man is bereft of passion and imagination! That is not who I am! Au contraire, he's the person you wanted to be. One who was less arrogant and undisciplined in his youth. One who was less like me. The Jean-Luc you wanted to be, the one who did not fight the Nausicaan, had a different career from the one you remember. That Picard never had a brush with death, never faced his own mortality, never realized how fragile life is, how important each moment must be. His life never came into focus. He drifted for much of his career, with no plan or agenda, going from one assignment to the next, never seizing the opportunities that presented themselves. He never led the away team on Milika III to save the ambassador, or take charge of the Stargazer's bridge when its captain was killed. And no one ever offered him a command. He learned to play it safe. And he never, ever got noticed by anyone. You're right, Q. You gave me the chance to change and I took the opportunity. But I admit now, it was a mistake. Are you asking me for something, Jean-Luc? Let me put things back the way they were before. Before you died in sickbay. Is that what you want? I would rather die as the man I was than live the life I just saw. Coward! Like all Starfleet. You talk and you talk, but you have no guramba. What did you say? I said, you are a coward. That's what I thought you said. His vital signs are stable. Captain. Jean-Luc. You were injured, but I think you're going to be alright. I still don't know what to make of it. Was it a dream? Or was it one of Q's elaborate tricks? A lot of people near death have strange experiences, but I have never heard one so detailed. There's still part of me that cannot accept that Q would give me a second chance, or that he'd demonstrate so much compassion. And if it was Q, ... ..I owe him a debt of gratitude. In what sense? He put you through hell. There are many parts of my youth that I'm not proud of. There were loose threads. Untidy parts of me that I would like to remove. But when I pulled on one of those threads, ... ..it unravelled the tapestry of my life. I was just trying to imagine a hellbent-for-leather young officer insulting a Nausicaan twice his size. I wish I could know that Jean-Luc Picard. That wasn't the first run-in I had with a couple of surly Nausicaans. Really? Yes. During my sophomore year, I was assigned to training on Morikin VII. There was a Nausicaan outpost on an outlying asteroid. One day... (ENGLISH) "
S6E16,"Captain's log, stardate 46578.4. The Enterprise has arrived at Station Deep Space Nine to assist in the reconstruction of the Bajoran aqueduct systems, damaged during the Cardassian occupation. I should be through with water analysis in a few hours, then I'll check out the holosuites. They have a relaxation program from Alture VII. Listen to this. First they bathe you in a protein bath. Then a cloud of chromal vapour carries you to a meditation chamber. You should try it. I'll be too busy discussing water management with ten Bajoran bureaucrats. They won't be carrying me on a cloud of chromal vapour. Ops. What is this? Pasta al fiorella. One of my favourites. You'll love it. I want to look at those Ktaran antiques. They've got a 21st-century plasma coil in almost perfect condition. I'll have to talk to Chief O'Brien about these replicators. Worf, I don't see how you can eat that stuff. It tastes like liquid polymer. Delicious. I think I'm gonna try that kiosk. They had some real food. Commander, I am reading a power drain in the starboard EPS conduit. What's causing it? The problem is originating in sickbay. There's been an unauthorized access into the bio-imaging system. Better check it out. Aye, sir. Excuse me. Do you have authorization for this area? Come in. I need a hand with this field generator. See if you can boost the power output to 65 percent. I am sorry. Use of sickbay equipment is limited to ship's medical personnel. Dr Julian Bashir, Chief Medical Officer, Deep Space Nine. And you are Commander...? Data. Cmdr Data. The synthetic life form. Yes. An honour to meet you. I've heard so much about you. You must have a fascinating perspective into cybernetic research. I'd be delighted to discuss it. I would be happy to do so, but I must ask you to stop your experiment. Yes. I should have asked before using your sickbay. But it would take days to analyze this device with the computer I have. What type of device is this? It's from the Gamma quadrant. A medical instrument. It appears to employ plasma inputs. I'm hoping it's a medical scanner. I wanted to use your computer to see how it works. I suggest we take it to Engineering and run a circuit-pathway diagnostic. Splendid. I must admit, Commander, I didn't think you'd be so personable. Klingon. You are Starfleet Klingon. I am Lt Worf. Worf. Son of Mogh. What of it? I am Jaglom Shrek, a man with information to sell. You have no information I could use. I would not be so sure. It is about your father, Mogh. My father died 25 years ago at Khitomer. That is what you believe. What if I tell you he is still alive? Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. My father is dead. No, he's not. I know where he is. How is that possible? I expect to be paid for my information. Perhaps we could negotiate an exchange. The location of your father... Tell me what you know. Not all the Klingons at Khitomer were killed during the massacre. Many were captured by the Romulans and placed in a prison camp on a remote planet. Your father was among them. Where is this planet? Not far from here. I could give you the location, for a price. A Klingon would rather die than be taken prisoner! I should kill you for spreading lies about my family. My father was killed defending Khitomer. Ensign Lopez, this duty roster is unacceptable. Assignments should be listed by priority. Prepare it again. I'll expect it no later than 0900 hours. Dismissed! Mr. Worf, we need to get the rendezvous schedule to the Merrimack. I am well aware of your request. Lieutenant, are you alright? Yes, sir, I am fine. I will send your schedules, sir. Excuse me. Enter. Did the table do something wrong? No. I'm glad you weren't that hard on Ensign Lopez. He made a mistake. The duty roster was inaccurate. Would you like to talk about what's bothering you, or would you like to break more furniture? Today on the Promenade, a Yridian approached me. He knew who I was and tried to sell me information about Mogh. Your father? He claimed that he's alive and is being held captive in a Romulan prison camp. Oh, my God. Could it be true? A Klingon would never allow himself to be captured. A warrior fights to the death. If my father were alive, it would dishonour his sons and their sons. Even Alexander would bear the burden. So, you're willing to ignore the possibility because of dishonour? My father is dead. That Yridian is selling lies. If you're so sure about that, why are you so upset? Worf, you can't deny the possibility just because you don't want it to be true. If you want to talk, you know where to find me. If we transfer 20 megajoules from the dilithium chamber into the plasma inputs, it should activate the device. It's worth a try. You two connect the coil. I'll configure the energy transfer. Data, can I ask you a personal question? Certainly. Does your hair grow? I can control follicle replenishment. However, I've not had a reason to modify my hair's length. Why? Just curious. Power conduits are ready. Is something wrong? You're breathing. Yes. I have a functional respiratory system. However, its purpose is to maintain thermal control of my systems. I am, in fact, capable of functioning in a vacuum. And you have a pulse. My circulatory system not only produces biochemical lubricants, it regulates micro-hydraulic power. Most people are interested in my extraordinary abilities. How fast I can compute. My memory capacity. How long I will live. No one ever asked me if my hair grows or noticed that I breathe. Your creator went to a lot of trouble to make you seem human. I find that fascinating. OK, I think we're ready. Power connections are complete. I'll monitor the coil's transfer rate. Can you check the transient power response? Of course. We are ready, Geordi. OK. Initiating energy transfer. Power levels are steady. Transient response is normal. Hold on. I'm picking up a power surge. Reduce the transfer rating. Reducing by 20 percent. What happened? The connections blew. It sent out a plasma shock. Synaptic energy is dropping. Data, are you alright? I believe so. What has happened? A plasma shock overloaded your positronic net. You were down 30 seconds. That cannot be possible. I have a memory record for that period. I can recall images. I saw Dr Soong. My father. I can't find anything wrong with your positronic subprocessors. No sign of any residual energy fluctuation, cascade overload. My internal diagnostic indicates that my memory systems are within normal parameters. For the 47 seconds I was inactive, there was no cognitive activity. There's no doubt about it. You were shut down. Maybe you had some kind of random power fluctuation causing you to access memory files. That cannot be. The image I saw was of Dr Soong as a young man. I did not encounter him until later in his life. There appears to be no rational explanation for my experience. I'll take a look at the diagnostic log. In the meantime, you'd better disconnect that device. Data, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way. How so? Maybe you had a dream or a hallucination. I am not capable of either. Yet you can't account for what happened today, can you? At present, I cannot. You should approach this from a human standpoint. You're right that machines can't have hallucinations. But then again, most machines can't grow hair. Wait. What is it, Commander? I am sorry, but I have a question of a personal nature. Do you have a moment? A moment. I have heard you mention that you once experienced a vision. Yes. When I was young, my adoptive parents arranged for me to partake in the Rite of MajQa. I understand it involves deep meditation in the caves of No'Mat. That prolonged exposure to the heat induces a hallucinatory effect. Why are you asking? I have recently had an unusual experience which might be a vision. What happened? An accident shut down my cognitive functions for a short period, yet I seemed to remain conscious. I saw my father. You are very fortunate. That is a powerful vision. If it was a vision, I do not know how to proceed. You must find its meaning. If it is to do with your father, learn all you can about it. In the Klingon MajQa ritual, there is nothing more important than a revelation about your father. Your father is a part of you. Always. Learning about him teaches you about yourself. That is why, no matter where he is or what he has done, ... ..you must find him. But I am not looking for my father. Yes, of course. Do not stop until you have the answer. Thank you, Worf. Ah, Lt Worf. You have reconsidered? Yes. I wish to go to the Romulan prison camp. Excellent. I can provide you with the coordinates. No, you will take me there. No, it's not possible. I have no means of transportation. I checked the station records. You have a vessel capable of warp speed. I do not have the time. I have other business... What is the real reason you will not take me? Because what you told me is not true? No. The camp is located on the edge of Romulan space. It is a dangerous journey. Dangerous? It would be more dangerous for you to refuse. Very well. But I will require full payment in advance. No, I will pay after. But... Yes. Yes, of course. After. If you are lying, if there is no camp, I will kill you. The Romulan guards have a detection perimeter. It will be necessary to transport you to the surface 30 kilometers from the camp. The foliage is very dense. It will take me 12 hours to reach the camp. I may have to travel at night. That would be unwise. This is not an empty jungle. There are many predators. I am prepared. Very well. But I recommend that you look up from time to time. The arboreal needle snake likes to attack from above. I will provide you with a map of the camp. How did you learn of this camp? It is not important for you to know. Why have you not informed the Klingon government? I sell information. I do not give it away. You do this for profit. I have my reasons, Mr. Worf. What reasons could you have for letting these people suffer? We will arrive in the Carraya Sector in approximately three hours. I suggest you get some rest. Come. Yes, Mr. Data? Sorry to disturb you, sir. Not at all. I'm studying the intricacies of Bajoran aqueduct management. I would welcome an interruption. Please sit down. I require your advice. I have come to an impasse regarding my recent unexplained experience. Your vision of Dr Soong. How is your investigation proceeding? I have analyzed over 4,000 religious and philosophical systems as well as 200 psychological schools of thought in an effort to understand what happened. And what have you found? I have been unable to find a single interpretation of the images I saw. The hammer, for instance, has several meanings. The Klingon culture views it as a symbol of power, the Taque tribe of Nagor sees it as an icon of hearth and home. The Ferengis view it as a sign of sexual prowess. I'm curious. Why are you looking at all these other cultures? The interpretation of visions and metaphysical experiences are almost always culturally derived. I have no culture of my own. You do. You're a culture of one, which is no less valid than a culture of one billion. Perhaps the key to understanding your experience is to stop looking into other sources for a meaning. When we look at Michelangelo's David or Symnay's Tomb, we don't ask what it means to others but what it means to us. Explore this image, Data. Let it excite your imagination. Focus on it. See where it leads you. Let it inspire you. I believe I understand, sir. Thank you. Good luck, Mr. Data. The camp is in a southeasterly direction. After ten kilometers, you will come to the edge of the sulphur canyon. Look for a riverbank and follow it until you come to the camp. This is a homing device. It will allow you to find my ship when I return. I will not land in the same location. When will you return? 50 hours. Do not be late. Who's there? Toq, is that you? I can see you. I hope you're enjoying yourself. Toq, I swear I will hang you by your... Stop. Please. Who are you? I've come to help you. Help me? Yes. How did you get out of the camp? Does anyone know you are gone? Yes. I come here often. You must lead me to the camp. You are Klingon. Where did you come from? That does not matter. I have come to take you home. Home? This is my home. Ba'el! It is important you tell no one you saw me. Is it time for the ceremony? We're about to begin. Come in. Data, we were supposed to meet at... What are you doing? I am painting. I can see that. How long have you been at this? I have created 23 illustrations in the past six hours, 27 minutes. I believe you could say I have been inspired. I'll say. I have done as Capt Picard suggested. I have tried to explore the images. Has it helped? I am not certain. I began by painting the image of the blacksmith. Then I painted the corridor. After that, ... ..the anvil, the hammer... ..and Dr Soong's face. The thought then occurred to me... ..that I should paint smoke. Smoke? Why smoke? I cannot explain it. It is not an image I saw in my vision. You got the smoke coming out of a bucket of water. Blacksmiths used water to cool the metal. Maybe that's why you painted it. Perhaps. After I'd painted the smoke, it then occurred to me... ..to paint a bird's wing. I then drew an entire bird. A flock of birds flying in formation. An individual feather. If the bird is related to my vision, I do not understand how. I am left with more of a mystery than ever. Geordi, I want to recreate the experiment which caused my shutdown. What for? My vision may have continued had I not been reactivated. That plasma shock almost fused your neural net. I don't think it's a good idea. I am aware of the risks. But I know no other way to investigate my experience. Will you help? Yeah, sure. I'll go find Dr Bashir. I will prepare the power transfer. OK, Data. We're gonna monitor every subsystem in your positronic net. If I see any neural pathways overload beyond 65 percent, I'm shutting down the experiment. Agreed. We're ready. Initiating energy transfer. Get ready, Data. Power levels are rising. It should be any second now. The bird did not appear in my original experience. This vision is different. Of course it's different. It's never the same. Always changing. Unpredictable. It doesn't make sense. What is happening, Father? I don't know, Data. What is happening? We are on the deck of the Enterprise. My cat is present. My potted plant. And my paintings. A beginning. Still a little grounded in the mundane, but... ..showing promise. I do not understand. You're not supposed to. No man should know where his dreams come from. It spoils the mystery. The fun. I'm proud of you, son. I wasn't sure you'd ever develop the cognitive abilities to make it this far. But if you're here, if you can see me, ... ..you've crossed over the threshold from being a collection of circuits and subprocessors, ... ..and have started a wonderful journey. What type of journey? Think of it... Think of it as an empty sky. I do not understand. Shh. Just dream, Data. Dream... Data. You are the bird. The images I saw while shut down were generated by a series of previously dormant circuits. I believe Dr Soong incorporated them into my program, intending to activate them once I reached a certain level. The plasma shock activated them prematurely. That is correct. I'm curious. Now they are active, what will you do? I plan to shut down my cognitive functions each day. I hope to generate new visions. It sounds like dreaming. An accurate analogy. Remarkable. This might get me published in the Starfleet Cybernetics Journal. Would you mind if I authored a paper on this? Of course not. Thank you, Data. And sweet dreams. Quiet! I'm a friend. Who...? Who are you? Worf, son of Mogh. Why have you come here? I have come to find my father. Is he alive? Is he here? Your father fell at Khitomer. Did he die in battle? He was fortunate. You were captured. Yes. Romulans. They robbed you of your right to die in battle. There's little time. How many Klingons are being held here? 73. How many Romulans? There are things you do not understand. What do you mean? I must speak with the elders. I knew your father well, Worf. And I remember you. A boy, barely able to lift a bat'leth. Once, your father insisted we take you on the ritual hunt. You were so eager, you tried to take the beast with your bare hands. It mauled your arm. I still have the scar. I do remember you now. You should not have come here. I do not understand. You should not have come. Who is this? I am Worf. I can help you escape. He does not know. He must leave at once. It's too late. He would bring others. We are not leaving here and neither are you. (ENGLISH) "
S6E17,"Last time, on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". Not all the Klingons at Khitomer were killed during the massacre. Many were captured by the Romulans and placed in a prison camp on a remote planet. Your father was among them. If my father were alive, it would dishonour his sons and their sons. Even Alexander would bear the burden. So, you're willing to ignore the possibility because of dishonour? My father is dead. That Yridian is selling lies. This is a homing device. It will allow you to find my ship. You are Klingon. Where did you come from? That does not matter. I have come to take you home. He must leave. It's too late. He would bring others. We are not leaving here and neither are you. And now, the conclusion. Take his pack. Are you afraid to die escaping? We are dead, Worf. We died at Khitomer. We were captured. It was worse than death. Why did you allow it? We had no choice. We were defending an outpost on the perimeter. The Romulans took out our shields, the next blast rendered us unconscious. When we awoke, we were prisoners, unarmed and shackled. We were interrogated for three months. We tried to starve ourselves but they kept us alive. The Romulan Cmdr Tokath thought he was being kind. The Romulans hoped to trade our lives for territorial concessions. The Klingon High Council refused to negotiate. They would not acknowledge that warriors had been taken prisoner. When it was clear we were of no use, Tokath offered to let us go. But we knew that our families believed we had fallen in battle. We would not return to dishonour them. We asked Tokath to let us stay. He took pity on us. I understand your desire to preserve your family's honour. But what of your own? There is no honour in remaining prisoners. We lost our honour when we were captured. It does not matter what happens to us. All that matters is that our families are not dishonoured. Why did you come here, Worf? If you had found your father, ... ..you would have found only dishonour. If he had been captured, as you were, if I had found him here, I would be glad to see him. There is no room in my heart for shame. I can only hope that if my son came here, ... ..he would be Klingon enough to kill me. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. This is a gin'tak spear. What of it? Have your parents taught you nothing? This is used for battle, not tilling soil. We have no need for weapons. The war is far away. What war? The war our parents came here to escape. That war was over many years ago. I'm not interested in what you've got to say. I've got work to do. Hello again, Worf. They say you've come to stay with us. Not by choice. Aren't you happy to have escaped the war? The war... Yes. We've heard the stories all our lives. How people are slaughtered in terrible battles, forced to fight whether they want to or not. That's why our parents came here, to make a safe home, a place to raise their children in peace. You should be relieved. You're safe here. A place can be safe and still be a prison. Where I come from, people are free to come and go. So are we. Tell your father that you would like to leave. Tell him that you want to visit the Klingon Homeworld. See what he says. Why would I go there? It's dangerous. Not any longer. Ba'el. Come here. Yes, Mother. You are not allowed to leave the compound? Then I won't see you at the pond again. I told you not to speak with him. I'm sorry, Mother. Enter. I am Tokath. I can return later if I'm disturbing you. It is a strange thing when the jailer concerns himself with his prisoner's comfort. Mine is a strange prison. You robbed the Klingons of who they were. You dishonoured them. By not slitting their throats when we found them? I do not expect you to understand. You are a Romulan. You're just like L'Kor was 20 years ago, proud and angry. He hated me. All the Klingons did. I had no love for them, I won't deny it. When I informed the High Command that the Klingons wanted to remain here, I was told that unless I stayed to oversee them myself they would be killed. My decision ended my military career. Why do it? I don't expect you to understand. You're a Klingon. But I do expect you to understand this. We've put aside the old hatreds. Here, Romulans and Klingons live in peace. I won't allow you to destroy what we have. Do not deceive yourself. These people are not happy here. I see the sadness in their eyes. That's not what I see when I look in my wife's eyes. I married a Klingon. So, when I warn you not to disrupt our lives, I'm not speaking just as a jailer, but as a man protecting his family. Do not test my tolerance. Do you know what that song means? No, I just like the melody. Stop. There. Captain's log, stardate 46759.2. The Yridian vessel Lt Worf boarded at Deep Space Nine failed to arrive for our scheduled rendezvous. It is now 12 hours overdue. Still no sign of them on long-range scanners. Contact DS9. Find out what they know about this Yridian trader. Hopefully, he filed a flight plan. It's our only chance of finding Worf. We haven't had to use one of these for a long time. It implants a small boridium pellet underneath the skin. We can use its energy signature to track you. In time, you will grow accustomed to life here. Never. He is one of yours. Deal with him however you like. But I warn you, if he becomes a disruption, I will not be so tolerant. Toq. You guard him. He is free to move around inside the compound. But make certain he does not cause trouble. What are you doing? This is the Mok'bara. The form clears the mind... ..and centres the body. No. Like this. First, learn how to breathe. Stand tall, as tall as you can. Now, take a wider stance. You must stop. These forms are the basis for Klingon combat. You would be wise to learn them. I will teach you. Join us. We will see what L'Kor thinks of this. Mother? She's not here. Come in. This is what I wanted to show you. I don't know why, but I'm not supposed to look at these. They're Klingon, aren't they? Yes. I thought you might be able to tell me about them. This is a warrior's armour. And this is a d'k tahg. It should not be allowed to rust like this. Isn't it beautiful? That is a jinaq. It is given to a daughter who has come of age, old enough to take a mate. Ba'el. Mother. Put that away at once. Why is she forbidden to know what these are? They are not needed here. Go! Kahless held his father's lifeless body in his arms. He could not believe what his brother had done. Then his brother threw their father's sword into the sea, saying if he could not possess it, neither would Kahless. That was the last time the brothers would speak. What happened to the sword? Kahless looked into the sea and wept. For the sword was all he had left of his father. The ocean filled with his tears and flooded over the shore. That is impossible. For you, perhaps. Not Kahless. He was a great warrior. You're making it up. No. These are our stories. They tell us who we are. It is late. It is time to sleep. Worf. You never answered my question. Did Kahless ever find his father's sword? Yes. He found it. The stories that you tell, are they true? I have studied them all of my life, and find new truths in them every time. This Kahless, did he ever take a mate? That is another story. Tell me. You are Romulan. Tokath is my father. I thought you knew that. How could your mother mate with a Romulan? Why shouldn't she? It is an obscenity. They love each other. Romulans are treacherous. Deceitful. They are without honour. My father is a good man. He is kind and generous. There is nothing dishonourable about him. He took part in a cowardly attack at Khitomer. Thousands of Klingons were massacred, many women and children. I don't know what you're talking about. My father escaped the wars. He would never kill anybody. Ask him. Ask your mother. Tell them you want to know the truth. What is it? We've received the Yridian's flight plan from Deep Space Nine. He's been to three systems in the past week. Worf could be at any one of them. Are any of them near Romulan space? Two of them. The Nequencia and the Carraya Systems. Let's head for the closer one. Aye, sir. What do you want? I am sorry if I upset you. I was surprised. I became angry. But I do not blame you. You cannot help being what you are. There is nothing wrong with what I am. What I mean is, it is not your fault. What, being born? I'm sorry that offends you. No. It is hard to explain. Klingons and Romulans have been blood enemies for centuries. Not here. Here, we live in peace. But I don't live here. Worf, before you knew, you were attracted to me. Can't you leave the hatred behind? Can't you accept me as I am? I do not know. Come on, Toq! Who's next? OK? Try again. Ka'la! That is not how you play this game. The qa'vak is not a game. It hones the skills of the hunt. The hunt? We have replicators here. Klingons do not hunt because they need food. The hunt reminds us of where we come from. I know where I came from. Right here. It is a difficult skill to master. Perhaps you are too young. Your arm is strong. But you need practice. Hold your other arm like this and aim along it. Roll. You learn quickly. Perhaps it is time to put your skills to the test. What do you mean? Come. I will take you on the hunt. You are not allowed to leave the compound. They won't allow it. I think they will. Hunting? Have you lost your mind? The boy can come with me. I cannot sit in the compound. I must practise my skills. We can't let you out. You've already tried to escape once. I give you my word, as a warrior. I will not try to escape. Leave us. We have work to do. Tokath. He gave his word. Are you seriously suggesting we open the gates and let him wander free, with only a boy as his guard? 23 years ago, I gave you my word. In all this time, have I ever broken it? I told you he was yours to deal with. If you want to take this risk, the responsibility is yours. You will go with him. Take a weapon. If he breaks his word and tries to escape, ... ..kill him. He is there. The wind has shifted. We must wait. Why? We're so close. Never approach prey from upwind. The breeze will carry your scent. The wind is shifting again. I can't smell anything. He is there. How can you...? Yes. I can smell it. Remember the scent. More than anything else, it will guide you. It is strong. I cannot believe I couldn't smell it before. Let it work its way into your blood. I can feel my heart pounding. Yes. This is the moment where life and death meet. This is what we are. Warriors. I was never taught that. There is much you were never taught. Aren't you hungry, L'Kor? Or are you upset because your prisoner has not returned? I should not have sent the boy with him. If he has been hurt... Don't worry, my friend. He'll come back. After all, a warrior keeps his word. Isn't that so? Father? If I wanted to visit Romulus or the Klingon Homeworld, would I be allowed to go? What is that? Tonight, we eat well. Get that off my table. You do not kill an animal unless you intend to eat it. Get rid of it. I intend to, Tokath. But not until it's cooked. Today, I learned the ritual hunt. But that is not all I learned. I discovered that warrior's blood runs through my veins. I do not know how or why, but we have forgotten ourselves. Our stories are not told. Our songs are not sung. Tonight, as we came home, we sang a song of victory. A song known only to me as a lullaby. But it is a warrior's song. Fire streaks the heavens. Battle has begun. Ba'el. Well, Worf, you've had quite an effect on the young people. I have done nothing more than show them who they are. No. You have shown them what you want them to be. Tell me this. Do you know of any place, any time in history, when Klingons and Romulans have lived together in peace? We have despised each other, fought each other, for centuries. Except here, on this remote planet, Romulans and Klingons live together in harmony. No government, no leader, has ever done what I have done here. And what about Toq? I saw what happened to him when he caught the scent of his prey on the wind. For the first time, he felt powerful. That is what he has been denied living here. That is what you have tried to take away from him. Now, you may be content to sit here and wither to old age, but Toq and the others have tasted what it is to feel truly alive. They will not give that up now! Enough of this. We could talk all night and not convince each other. I offer you a choice. Live with us as one of us. Or? Or I will have you put to death. Then that is what you will have to do. Worf, consider this carefully. That death will be honourable. The young people will see what it is to die as a Klingon. Enter. Thank you. I will remove the tracking device. You can go over the wall and hide in the jungle. Why are you doing this? My father is wrong. No matter how I feel about you, you don't deserve to die. I am not going to run away. They will kill you. Yes. But they will not defeat me. I don't understand you. A Klingon does not run away from battles. Is that the lesson you want us to learn? You've taught us a great deal, awakened something in us. But I don't understand what we can learn from your death. Then you do not yet understand what it is to be Klingon. Worf. In spite of everything that's happened, I still sense that you care for me. Am I wrong? You talk so much about being a warrior, about honour and death. Is it so hard to speak of love? Worf, please. I would not have thought it possible to love a Romulan. But you do. Yes. If you've come that far, can't you take it one more step? Can't you stay here with us? With me? If there were a way, I would take you away with me. If there's anything I have learned from you, from your reaction to me, it's that I have no place out there. Other Klingons will not accept me for what I am. And if I stay, these Klingons will not accept me for what I am. Why did you come here? We were so happy. We didn't know there was anything missing. Ba'el. Goodbye, Worf. I know that there are those among you who may question what I am about to do. You would not be wrong to do so. I have questioned myself, spent the night considering my decision, challenging myself to justify whether it is right. And I have reached the conclusion that it is absolutely necessary to put this man to death. What we have built together would be destroyed by this man. I cannot allow that to happen. I give you one last chance to accept our way of life. Those are eloquent words, Tokath. But the truth is, I am being executed because I brought something dangerous to your young people. Knowledge. Knowledge of their origins. Knowledge of the real reasons you are in this camp. The truth is a threat to you. Enough! Stand ready. Raise your weapons. Father! Stop this. If you kill him, you will have to kill me. Step aside, Toq. Worf would rather die than accept this way of life. And so would I. I want to leave, as do many of us. You have to kill us to keep us here. You see, Tokath? It is already too late. I am warning you. Move aside, now. Stand ready. Toq, move away. Take aim. Ba'el. Tokath. Long ago, when your captives asked to stay here, ... ..our hope was to avoid dishonouring our children on the Homeworld. But perhaps, over the years, we lost sight of our children that we raised here. This is our prison. It should not be theirs. Years ago, your parents made a great sacrifice for their families. Today, they do so again. For that, we must honour them. You must promise them never to reveal their secret. No one must know of this place. A supply ship's due in a few days. They will take us. When they arrive, Tokath will explain it to them. Then we will start a new life. Captain's log, supplemental. Our search for Worf was cut short when we received a message from him to rendezvous with a Romulan vessel. He has informed us we will be taking on passengers. It's good to see you. He seems fine. We're giving everyone a check-up in sickbay. Thank you, Doctor. Welcome home, Mr. Worf. Thank you, sir. Picard to bridge. Signal that the last group is on board. Aye, sir. You found what you were looking for, Mr. Worf? No, sir. There was no prison camp. Those young people are survivors of a vessel that crashed four years ago. No one survived Khitomer. I understand.

S6E18,"Captain's log, stardate 46682.4. The Enterprise is docked at the Remmler Array, where it will undergo a procedure to eliminate baryon particles. In preparation for the sweep, we are evacuating the ship. Attention, personnel on decks 14 and 15. Your transporter-room assignment has been changed. Captain, we're still behind schedule on decks seven and eight. Shall I tell our base there'll be a delay? No. Open up the transporters on cargo bay two. Divert everyone from deck seven to put it on track. All Engineering personnel are requested to report to... Captain! The Arkaria Base does not have the units I requested. I have living tissue samples that won't survive the baryon sweep. I've tried to reason with them. Have La Forge transport a stasis unit from astrophysics. You can convert it to store samples. Thank you, Captain. All science personnel. Please check in with your section chief for duty assignment. I'm heading to deck seven. The auto-shutdown is on hold until we're back on schedule. Resume the sequence. Troi has taken care of the situation. Captain. Bridge. It has been quite a day. Has it not? Yes, it has. However, a change of routine is often invigorating and a welcome diversion after a long assignment. Exactly. I understand that Arkaria has very interesting weather patterns. Mr. Data, are you alright? Yes, sir. I am filling a silent moment with non-relevant conversation. Small talk. Yes, sir. I find that humans often use small talk during awkward moments. Therefore, I have written a new subroutine for that purpose. How did I do? Perhaps it was a little too non-relevant. But if you really are interested in small talk, keep your eye on Cmdr Hutchinson at the reception this afternoon. He's a master. Thank you, sir. I will. Captain. Captain. After you. No, after you. I believe you spoke first. Gentlemen! Mr. Worf? The computer needs your authorization to disable command functions. Are we ready? Almost. I requested two field diverters for the core and the bridge. They haven't been installed. Additional units? Yes, sir. We've logged so many warp hours that our baryon levels are high. I'm concerned that when the Remmler Array sweeps the ship, it will have to use a stronger beam than normal. It might overload the field converters protecting our systems. How long till new ones are in place? About 20 minutes. Very well. Computer, disable all command functions in 30 minutes. Authorization, Picard, Gamma 6073. Authorization acknowledged. Captain, incoming message. It's the station administrator, Mr. Orton. In my ready room. Captain. Request permission to be excused from Cmdr Hutchinson's reception. Permission granted. I wish I could excuse myself as well. Permission to... Mr. La Forge, I cannot excuse my entire senior staff! Mr. Worf beat you to it. Go ahead. If you're on schedule, I'd like to confirm that we'll begin the baryon sweep at 1500 hours, one hour from now. Confirmed. Cmdr Hutchinson also wanted me to make sure that you will attend his reception this afternoon. Tell him... I'm looking forward to it. He'll be delighted to hear that. Arkaria Base out. Tell Arkaria we're almost finished. We need two more conduits. I need to run a diagnostic. Get the diverter aligned. Where's the ODN interface? Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Beverly. Lovely as ever! How do you manage it? Good to see you again. It's been too long. Four years! Now, I want to hear about everything after Starfleet Medical. And I have so much to tell you! That must be Cmdr Riker! Excuse me. Of course. Pardon me. You must be Will Riker. I must be. Calvin Hutchinson. Call me Hutch. Calvin, awful name. I've never forgiven my parents. Soon as I saw you, I knew you were the First Officer. Of course. Your reputation precedes you! Flashing blue eyes, square jaw. Quite the ladies' man. Don't be modest, Will. May I call you Will? Sure. I also hear that you're a musician. I hope you'll play something. It's not often we entertain the Command crew of the flagship. And speaking of command! Hello, Capt Picard. Commander. I was just saying what a pleasure it is to have you here. How are you? Very well, thank you. It is very good to see you both again! Beverly! May I call you Beverly? Have you noticed that the mean temperature here on Arkaria is slightly higher than normal for human comfort-levels? I have found that humans prefer a body temperature of 21C in order to operate most efficiently. However, there are several cultures who actually prefer that their temperature is identical to the room in which they are standing. The Sheliak. I am telling you, you have never seen anything like this. There were thousands of them. The northern sky turned dark. Geordi, Deanna. I don't think you have met our host. This is Lt Cmdr Geordi La Forge. Counsellor Deanna Troi. This is Cmdr Hutchinson. Call me Hutch. I was just telling your captain about the sights on Arkaria. Are you interested in ornithology? Well... The mating habits of the Arkarian horn fowl are interesting. If the weather were better, we could take horses to their nests. Horses? Yes. We have trails through the plains. Unfortunately, it's not pleasant now. Cold, muddy. Not a soul for kilometers. Perfect. Mr. La Forge, how long before the baryon sweep? About 25 minutes. I have time to get my saddle. Your saddle? Yes. A saddle is a very personal thing. It has to be broken in, used, cared for. You keep a saddle on board the Enterprise? Yes, for when I have the opportunity to ride. I see. It's normal. Most serious riders do have their own saddles. Of course. Absolutely! Well, if you will excuse me... Amazing man. He reminds me of another officer I knew years ago. A Capt Edwell. He was fascinating. Born on Gaspar VII, but you wouldn't know it. Auto-shutdown in progress. Defensive systems off line. Baryon sweep begins in eight minutes. What are you doing? Someone left this ODN junction box open. I thought you were supposed to be off the ship. The diverters have to be synchronized. I was laser-bonding a backup. I see. I'd better let you finish up so that you can get off. Excuse me a minute. Auto-shutdown sequence in progress. Primary power off line in one minute. We need to bypass the conduit. That's on deck 30. Get Pomet started on it right away. Primary power off line in 30 seconds. Final warning. Primary power off line in ten seconds. Yes. I find it fascinating that your family dropped the prefix Pel from your surname. It was my understanding that Pel Orton is a more noble appellation than Orton. Yes. Perhaps the recent trend toward an egalitarian society is responsible. Perhaps. The crew of the Magellan put on a talent show here. Capt Conklin did a poetry reading. Imagine that. I'm trying to. Did I tell you how I came here? I was serving on Admiral Mitchell's staff on Star base 97. Awful place. Have you met our Cmdr Data? As a matter of fact, I find it oddly amusing! No, I don't think so. Come on. I'll introduce you. Several cultures have extremely similar etymological histories. Mr. Data, have you had a chance to meet Cmdr Hutchinson? Call me Hutch. Our second officer. A pleasure. The pleasure is mine, Hutch. I want to compliment you on your choice of colours. You really think so? It wasn't easy, making a final decision. I can imagine. The light would make colour selection problematic. Precisely! Thank you. You're welcome. I'm not sure who to feel sorry for. Mr. Orton? You'll excuse me, Commander? Geordi, where's the Captain? He went back to get his saddle. His saddle? Any serious rider would have his own saddle. He's probably ten kilometers from here already. Lucky him! Thank you. Kelsey to Devor. Kelsey to Devor Devor, this is Kelsey. Reply. Devor, do you read me? Kelsey to Kiros. This is Kiros. Devor isn't responding There must be too much interference. Go find him. See if he's finished on deck seven. Meet us in Main Engineering. Understood. Who are you? What are you doing on my ship? The baryon sweep uses a high-frequency plasma field. Your phaser won't work. You're probably right. But I'd like to bet this will. A laser welder can be deadly. Now, what's going on in Main Engineering? I suggest that you cooperate. You're Starfleet. You won't kill me. You sure? Seems you're right. Tyrellian laser art is very similar in form and composition. Of course! I used to be stationed on Tyrellia. Really? There are five Tyrellians serving aboard the Enterprise. Fascinating. Not many people know this. Tyrellia is only one of three known inhabited planets without a magnetic pole. I was aware of that. Are you aware that Tyrellia is one of seven known planets with no atmosphere? Really? They're still at it! Non-stop. It has a strange fascination. How long can two people talk about nothing? Is something wrong? I don't know. I got strange energy readings from your table. I'm sure it's not serious. Perhaps the heating is malfunctioning. Maybe I should look. I'm sure we can handle this, Commander. There's no need to concern yourself. Maybe I should look at the element. It's alright. Please, don't worry. What was that all about? I assure you it's alright. We'll look into it. You don't have to concern yourself. Orton, now! What is going on? Stay right where you are. Reduce the plasma pressure to 0.6 percent nominal. 0.6. How does the conduit look? It's clear. Alright. The plasma flow has been shunted to the aft conduit. We're ready here. OK, that should do it, I think. Be sure, Neil. Yes. Yeah, that does it. Alright! Transfer 500 milligrams from the reserve system to the core. Perfect! Adequate. Disable the overrides. Get the interlocks off the seal. Pomet! Prepare the transport assembly. Keep watching that power flow. It might... Keep working! Where did he come from? Deck seven. Who are you? My name is Mot. I'm the barber. Barber? What are you doing here? Everyone was evacuated to the surface. Yes, I know. But I wanted to ride. I didn't have my saddle... Your saddle? That's right. It's on deck seven. The power went out and I got lost... Alright! Shut up. Just shut up! Any sign of Devor? No. Satler. Get down here and keep an eye on our barber. Go see if you can find Devor. Make sure nothing's wrong. Sit down. Alright. Just don't point that thing at me. Do what I tell you. You won't have to worry. How long until you're ready? 40, maybe 50 minutes. The baryon sweep hits in 30 minutes. The diverter will protect us. I'm worried about that unit. I want the trilithium resin in there before the sweep gets here. I don't want to take chances. Understood. They haven't tried to communicate with the outside. No demands, no political statements, no theft. They must want something. Orton is not as calm as he looks. He's agitated and nervous. As if something's gone wrong. Maybe Geordi upset their timetable when he saw the hidden weapons. Orton may be improvising. Maybe he didn't plan on hostages and doesn't know what to do. If they do not have a plan, we may have the initiative. Maybe, but we need to figure out how to use it. How is he? There's no permanent damage. I've adjusted the optical transducer in his visor to block out some of the pain. It's only partially effective. I need to get him to a medical facility. I doubt if they'll agree to that. But maybe if we tell them Geordi's dying, they would give us access to a medical kit. We might be able to use the tools to make a weapon. Perhaps we can use the visor as a weapon. If the optical transducer were modified, we might be able to generate a hypersonic pulse. A hypersonic pulse would overload the audio receptors of everyone. It would cause immediate unconsciousness. Can you adjust the visor yourself? It will look suspicious if you both work on it. I'll try. I might need Geordi to help me through. Alright. Be as casual as you can. Let me know when you're ready. Ready. Begin draining the trilithium at 100 milligrams per minute. Neil, what's going on? Neil, get over here. Put that down. Don't worry. I've got it. I'll be right there. The primary inducer is fused. There's no way to fix it. With no diverter, we have no protection from the baryon sweep. I know that. How long before the baryon sweep gets here? About 12 minutes. We should go to ten-forward. That's the last place that will be swept by the baryon field. Alright, we're leaving. We're taking the trilithium with us. What? Do you know how volatile trilithium is? We can't just start hauling it through the ship! I'll... I'll try to make some modifications. Satler's dead. He ran into the baryon sweep. What about Mot? I don't know. I don't think he's a barber. I found this in the Jefferies tube. Kelsey to Kiros. This is Kiros. We have a problem. There's a Starfleet officer still aboard. He's killed Satler and maybe Devor. He destroyed the diverter in Engineering. We have to leave before the baryon sweep enters. What about the trilithium resin? We're taking it to ten-forward. Kelsey, don't be a fool. You know better than to move trilithium resin. Mr. Mot! Or should I call you Lieutenant? Lieutenant Commander, perhaps? Call me what you wish. Moving trilithium requires specific equipment. You can't just improvise. I wouldn't need to improvise if you hadn't damaged our diverter. If you're so concerned, I suggest you stop interfering with us, before you set off an explosion that destroys the Enterprise. And you. I would rather destroy the ship than give the resin to terrorists. What makes you think I am a terrorist? Trilithium resin is a toxic waste- product produced by our engines. Its only use is as a weapon. You might be right, but we have been planning for this for a long time. I doubt you'll be able to stop us. Find him! Or even slow us down. There. 300 milligrams of trilithium. I'm using a dynamic stabilizer to act as a control rod. That should keep the resin stable enough for transport. Come on! Don't be so tense. If something goes wrong, you won't have time to worry about it. Three more decks, then we take corridor 15B to ten-forward. What's wrong? We have to find another way up. The rungs are cut. That wasn't very clever, Mr. Mot. If you knew where we were, you should have attacked. Now we'll take a route, one you might not be able to predict. There are only so many ways to ten-forward. Ten-forward is the logical place to stay ahead of the sweep. That sweep is just as big a threat to you as it is to us. In fact, if I were you, Mr. Mot, I'd be trying to find another way off this ship. I plan on leaving the same way you do. On your ship. What ship? Come on, Kelsey. You've been planning this. You must have a way to get off the Enterprise and leave this system. I think a ship is coming for you. I plan to be on it. It's a small ship, Mr. Mot. I don't think there's room for both of us. I'm sorry to hear that. I'll send your regrets. How is he, Doctor? He's in a lot of pain but I think he should be fine. He needs some water. Is that alright? We're almost ready. When we set the visor to emit the pulse, there'll be a burst of light. We need a distraction. They need a distraction. How long? Just a few seconds. I think I can distract Orton for a few seconds. I don't think Orton's in a talking mood, Will. You just have to know how to talk to him. Orton. I think we need to discuss the situation. There is nothing to discuss. Sit down. There's a lot to discuss. Be reasonable. I am not interested in hearing your hostage-negotiation tactics. It can't hurt you to listen, can it? Alright. Thank you. Now, the first thing we need to discuss is this... Hold it. Put your weapon down. Kelsey, this is Kiros. I'm on deck ten. I have Mot. Is he alive? Yes. Good. Meet us at intersection 41 . Understood. This way. Give me the trilithium. How much farther do we have to go? Not far. With all the modifications you've made to this unit, will we have problems removing the trilithium? No. Just remove the control rod, drain the unit. There shouldn't be any problem. That's all I wanted to know. Well! Not as clever as you thought. Where's Pomet? He shot him with an arrow. He's not dead. He will be soon. The sweep's nearly here. No time to go back. What about Neil? The sweep got him. Let's go. I thought you'd just talk to him. I did. He just didn't like what I had to say. That was a perimeter warning from the Remmler Array. A small ship is approaching. Mr. Orton has dropped his shields. This must be the sign. Mr. Data, you will be the only one unaffected by the burst. As soon as everyone else is unconscious, I need you to get to that computer and stop that ship somehow. I will try, sir. Now. Kelsey, perhaps we can work out a deal. You're the one who needs a deal, Mot. My name isn't Mot. It's Jean-Luc Picard. Capt Picard, this is all beginning to make sense. Leave the trilithium. Take me with you as a hostage. I am not a terrorist, I have no political agenda, although I know some people who do have agendas. And they are very interested in this little container. Profit. This is all about profit. I prefer to think of it as commerce. Open the door. Now, go through slowly. Well, Picard, I guess I'll be the one to send your regrets. Picard to Arkaria Base. Deactivate the baryon sweep. Arkaria Base. This is Capt Picard on board the Enterprise. Deactivate the baryon sweep! Arkaria Base. This is Capt Picard. Deactivate the baryon sweep immediately! Data to Capt Picard. Do you read me, sir? Picard here. Are you alright, Captain? Yes, Mr. Data. A scout ship has just beamed someone off the Enterprise. Do you know anything about it? I know they won't get far. Hold still. You have a nasty cut here. Any luck? Sorry, Captain. I don't know what happened to it. Hold still! I can't heal this if you don't stop fidgeting. Security has searched deck seven. They found nothing. There. I found it. Someone put it in a maintenance locker. Thank you. You keep a saddle on board? Mr. Worf, I'm surprised. Anyone who is an experienced rider has his own saddle. It's perfectly normal. Actually, it came in handy. I only wish I'd been able to use it on a horse. Of course. (ENGLISH) "

S6E20,"Captain's log, stardate 46731.5. We are in the Volterra Nebula, a stellar nursery. Our mission is a routine analysis of proto-stars in various stages of development. Captain, I have completed the evaluation of the outer shell. Our survey is complete. Continue to the next one. Three-quarters impulse. Riker to Capt Picard. Go ahead. May I see you in the observation lounge, sir? I'll be right there. My God! Then you can identify that object, Mr. Picard? Professor Galen? Computer, lights up. I suppose I should say Captain Picard. The Professor contacted me. He suggested we surprise you. To clarify, I insisted. Your first officer kindly accommodated me. I trust I'm not being overly presumptuous, now that my star pupil is master of the stars. No one could be more welcome on the Enterprise. I never thought I would see a Kurlan naiskos. Fifth dynasty? Is that your conclusion, Mr. Picard? Forgive me, I should say... Captain? Please, Mister will do fine. The overall impression is certainly fifth dynasty. The... surface ornamentation... Yes? Green polychrome over the eyes and the eyes themselves are closed. This is third dynasty. From the workshop of the master of Tarquin Hill! Well done! Will, the master of Tarquin Hill designed ceramic objects 300 years ahead of their time. All we know of him is the work. His name was never discovered. This object is... over 12,000 years old. The planet Kurl? It's a long way outside Federation territory. Yes, I thought your study of Kurlan artefacts was done. I was in the neighbourhood last summer. I couldn't resist. Go ahead. You mean it's complete? Well... The Kurlan civilization believed that an individual was a community of individuals. Inside us are... ..many voices, each with its own desires, style and view of the world. The Kurlan civilization died out long ago. It is extraordinarily rare to find a figurine intact. This is an incredible find. It's yours, Jean-Luc. No. How can I accept this? Graciously, Mr. Picard. You could accept it graciously! Thank you. How long can you stay? So much to say. The Professor meets a Vulcan ship in two days. Two days? That's not enough time! We may have much more. I don't understand. I'm on an expedition. A journey into an unexplored and historical territory, and I intend to take you with me. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, supplemental. It's 30 years since I saw my archaeology professor. His presence has taken me back to a time when I had considered a different career. May I ask you a frank question? Please. Your published writings have been sporadic for the past decade. Your appearance at symposia has been rare, or scheduled, then cancelled at the last moment. Our finest archaeologist is now shrouded with a cloak of mystery. As a result my reputation has no doubt grown! I've never heard of anyone who didn't love a good mystery. The Satarran of Sothis III disdained them, but as a general idea your statement holds. So, what have you been doing for the past decade? Do you know micropalaeontology? Yes. It's the study of fossil records at a microscopic level. I read your papers on the subject, but... that was years ago. It seemed as though the work had stopped. No. The work continued. I made a discovery so profound in its implications that silence seemed the wisest course. This work has occupied my every waking thought, it's intruded on my dreams, it's become my life. When finished and I announce my findings, it'll be heard halfway across the galaxy. Tell me. I cannot, Mr. Picard. That information comes with a price: your agreement to join me on the final leg of this expedition. For how long? Three months. Perhaps a year. If I had complete diplomatic access, and a starship, it'd be a few weeks. As it is, we'll only have my shuttle and whatever arrangement we can make with transports. Combined with our talents. Why do you need my help in this? I'm not a young man. There will be hazards along the way. I don't want my inadequacies to jeopardise the completion of this work. I am deeply honoured that you should think of me, but... I have responsibilities. To history! To Schliemann who discovered Troy and M'Tell when she first stepped on Ya'Seem. How can anything compare? May I sleep on it? Dream not of today, Mr. Picard. ""Dream not of today..."" The night blessing of the Yash-EI. As I recall, you missed that question on your final exam. I've had a few years to look it up. The Enterprise is yours for as long as you're here. Thank you. Dream not of today. Come! Good morning. Looks like you've been up for a while. Yes. Let's hear it. I had a long talk with Professor Galen last night. He asked me to leave the Enterprise and join him in an expedition which could last nearly a year. That must be tempting. I couldn't leave. But the offer raised in me certain feelings of regret. That you could have been an archaeologist? No, not really. I'm not sorry for the path I chose. But... the professor did not choose this gift at random. The many voices inside the one. You see, he knows that the past is a very insistent voice inside me. This gift is meant to remind me of that. And the exploration of space? Surely that must count for something? I wouldn't trade it for anything and I'd still make the same choice. I just wish I didn't have to say no a second time. Were you two very close? I had a father, but he was like a father who understood me. He had children, but they didn't follow in his footsteps, so... I was like the son who understood him. And yet you turned your back on him. In a way, I wish he'd never come on board the ship. Good morning, Mr. Picard. Professor. The Vulcan ship will take us to DS4. An Al-Leyan transporter will arrive three weeks later. They'll take us to Kea. We'll use the shuttle to get us to Indri VIII, our first stop. Professor... I'm afraid I won't be going. The Enterprise isn't something that I can leave and then come back to. If I go, I go for good. And it's not something I'm prepared to do. This is no undergraduate project, but the chance of a lifetime. Don't make the same mistake twice. My career in Starfleet hasn't been a mistake. What are you doing at this very moment? A study mission! You're like some Roman centurion out patrolling the provinces, maintaining a dull and bloated Empire. We both know that's not true. I know this. As a scholar, you're nothing but a dilettante. Years ago I gave you the opportunity to become the foremost archaeologist of your generation. Your achievements could have outstripped even my own, but no, you decided to reject a life of profound discovery. You walked out on me. I never wanted to become... Will you come with me? I can't. I'll be going. You're not scheduled to catch your ship for another two days. There is nothing for me here. Goodbye, Captain. Captain's log, supplemental. We now are en route to a diplomatic conference on Atalia VII. I must admit I've lost my enthusiasm for those proceedings. At our present speed, we will arrive at the Atalia system in 37 hours. Captain, I'm going for a walk in the arboretum. I wouldn't mind some company. Captain, a distress call from Dr Galen's shuttle. On screen. Enterprise! I'm being boarded... Transmission's blocked. The shuttle is under attack. Take us out of warp. On screen. A Yridian destroyer. Battle stations! Aye, sir. Galen is still inside. His life signs barely register. Get him out of there. The shuttle's enveloped by a tractor beam. We can't penetrate. Hail the Yridians. They're not responding. Return phaser fire. Disable their offensive systems! Worf! I don't understand, Commander. Our phaser blast could not have destroyed it. Transport Professor Galen directly to sickbay. Aye, sir. He took a disruptor hit point blank. There is nothing I can do. Jean-Luc... I was too harsh. Three Yridians boarded Galen's shuttle. What did they want? I'm not sure. They tried downloading from his computer. When he was attacked, Dr Galen protected certain files. We partly reconstructed his computer, so we have some of those files. We found 19 different blocks of numbers like this one. What do they mean? They could mean anything. Unless we narrow the search, it is impossible for the computer to identify the pattern. We tried every decryption key on record in case he was using code. Still can't make heads or tails of 'em. Did the Yridians get the numbers? Some of them. It's impossible to know how many. They knew a lot about his work. Perhaps what these numbers are. The information died with them. Not necessarily. Yridians are information dealers. They may have been delivering to someone else. Did they send a signal? No, sir. We detected no transmissions. And there were no other ships in the vicinity. Did the shuttle's logs show Galen's itinerary? Yes. The logs indicate he visited an unexplored star system, Ruah IV. How far from here? Four days at warp six, sir. The conference can wait. Set a course for the Ruah System. Standard orbit, Ensign. Ruah IV is a Class-M planet. 67 percent of its surface is covered with water. Its land mass contains multiple animal species, including proto-hominids. Scan for monuments that might indicate a previous civilization. There is nothing to indicate any former culture, sir. Then why was our foremost archaeologist here? He left the Enterprise in a Vulcan ship for Deep Space 4, and then, an Al-Leyan transport to Kea. And then the shuttle to Indri VIII. What do we know about Indri VIII? The Indri system was identified by Federation vessels nearly 60 years ago. The eighth planet is L-Class, covered with deciduous vegetation, unexplored, with no evidence of any civilizations. The planet possesses no animal life. Number One, we will proceed to Indri VIII. With all due respect, we've already run into a dead end. Indri VIII doesn't seem promising. And we're late for the conference. I'm aware of that. Galen visited here, then was on his way to Indri VIII when he died. There's a connection. I'm going to find it. Aye, sir. Lay a course for Indri VIII, warp seven. Come! How's it going? I thought if I stared at these number blocks long enough, then I would begin to see some kind of pattern. So far... ..nothing. I meant, how's it going with you? If I had gone with him... Captain, you can't start thinking like that. You didn't abandon him. You chose not to abandon a life-long career. It was the right decision, and not responsible for his death. I realize that. I know how much the professor meant to you and how much you want to find out what happened. But staring at these numbers isn't going to bring him back. The conference has been scheduled for six months. Starfleet is relying on your mediation... Counsellor, this is not simply some wild-goose chase to purge myself of guilt and remorse. I will not let Galen's death be in vain. If that means inconveniencing a few squabbling delegates for a few days, then so be it! I will take full responsibility. Captain. Entering the Indri system, sir. Capt Picard, approaching Indri VIII. On my way. Sensors are picking up severe atmospheric fluctuations. Assume a high orbit. On screen, Mr. Worf. A plasma reaction is consuming the lower atmosphere. Can we stop it? No, sir. The reaction is global. All life on the planet is being destroyed, sir. Why would anyone destroy all life on an uninhabited, neutral planet with no strategic importance? All the life...? Perhaps the number blocks relate to organic matter! If we narrow the search to the biological database, it'll increase the chances of finding a match. I'll be in the lab. Pattern match found. Specify. The numbers represent fragments of deoxyribonucleic-acid strands. DNA fragments? Each a different life form from 19 different worlds! These planets are scattered. No wonder it took Galen so long to collect them. But why? Wait a minute... These fragments seem to have similar protein configurations. They're chemically compatible. Not possible. Different species. There should be no compatibility. I know, but the base-pair combinations are uniform. If I'm right... Computer, connect the DNA according to protein-link compatibility. What is it? I have no idea. This is not part of a natural design, Captain. It's an algorithm, at the molecular level. An algorithm? These DNA fragments are part of a computer program? I know how it sounds, but this can't be random. This is from a program. This fragment's been in every DNA strand on Earth since life began. The others are just as old. Someone wrote this over four billion years ago. So, four billion years ago, someone scattered this genetic material into the primordial soup of at least 19 planets in the galaxy? Genetic information was incorporated into early life forms and passed down for generations. Why would anyone do this? What is this program designed for? We couldn't know till we ran it. We tried all DNA in the Federation computer but we can't find compatible configurations. So it's from outside the Federation. Data, how many on board are non-Federation? 17, sir. This is a long shot, but we should check these 17 people for this protein configuration. I'll collect DNA samples now. I've been thinking. Someone else must know about this program. I bet one fragment was on Indri VIII. That's why it was destroyed. To stop us finding that piece of the puzzle. It's four billion years old. A computer program from a highly advanced civilization, hidden in the very fabric of life itself. Whatever information this program contains could be the most profound discovery of our time. Or the most dangerous. And the Professor knew that. They all came up negative. I have scoured every page of the Professor's writings for a clue as to where to go next. So far, nothing. We've been at this too long. Why don't we get some sleep and start again tomorrow morning? ""I was in the neighbourhood."" When I asked the professor why he went all the way to Kurl, he said, ""I was in the neighbourhood."" Doing what? Collecting DNA samples. Only one Kurlan planet is capable of supporting life. Loren III. No. No Loren III sample from the data downloaded from the shuttle. If he had one, it must have been taken by the Yridians. Mr. Data, set a course for Loren III. Maximum warp. Aye, sir. We are entering the Loren system. Orbit the third planet. Our competition may be there before us. Battle stations, Mr. Worf. Aye. We are now in orbit. On screen. You're right. We've got company. Cardassians. They're hailing us. On screen. I am Gul Ocett. Identify yourself and state your business here. I am Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise and I see no reason why I should answer to you. Cardassians have no claims here. I suppose not. But my, admittedly hasty, estimate shows one Federation starship and two Cardassian war vessels. Perhaps I have miscounted. Not at all. We are on a scientific mission. You have no reason to interfere with us. And you have nothing to lose by delaying for a few days. I invite you to withdraw. Captain, Klingon attack cruiser decloaking. They are hailing us. This is the Klingon vessel Maht-H'a. What are you doing here? Captain's log, supplemental. We have two competitors as we try to complete the Professor's puzzle. I have asked the Cardassian and Klingon captains to meet with me. We all know why we're here. If we can admit that, we can move forward. We're scouting the planet for possible colonization. A ridiculous story! Why are you here, then? Scientific research. Look, if we try to deceive one another, we shall get nowhere. I think we all know about Professor Galen's research. And about the computer program composed of DNA fragments. I will take your silence as confirmation. None of us has the DNA fragments necessary to complete the program. You were the first to arrive in this system. Do you have a sample from the planet below? Yes. And I will fire on anyone who attempts to obtain another one. As if we fear Cardassian threats! I believe one of you has a fragment from Indri VIII. Yes. And there will be no other samples from Indri VIII. What does that mean? He destroyed the biosphere after he got a sample. Typical Klingon thinking. Take what you want and destroy the rest. We're all missing some fragments, not necessarily the same ones. Unless we combine them, we will never learn the secret. There is no secret! It's an ancient weapon design of incredible power. The Klingon Empire will not let it fall into an enemy's hands. Or even a friend's. A weapon? The Yridians claim the program leads to an unlimited power source. Until we assemble it, we will never know its purpose. He's right! It could be a recipe for biscuits. Biscuits! If that is what you believe, go back to Cardassia. I will send you my mother's recipe. How dare you! Enough! Without cooperation, we will get nowhere. What do you propose? If you bring your samples on board, I will combine them with ours. We will all observe the results, giving no one the advantage. And if we refuse? Then this endeavour dies here, in this room. Captain. Excellent! Still one missing piece. We gave ours up for nothing! You are very short-sighted, Nu'Daq. We are closer than we were. We may be very much closer indeed. We have no idea where to look for the missing DNA fragment. This is a jigsaw puzzle scattered across the galaxy. Shouldn't we assume the designers want us to find it? Why else put the pieces in our DNA? Wouldn't that suggest they'd make it easy for us to find the pieces, that there's a pattern to their distribution? The computer might find that pattern. Doctor, program the computer to analyze what we have, correcting for changes in star configurations. Extrapolate for the missing piece. That will take hours. Excuse me. Stay on board while we wait. I intend to. Good evening, Commander Data! Captain. Any word on the missing fragment? The computer is working on it. It will let me know shortly. Commander, your reputation for physical strength is known even in the Klingon Empire. Do you know the B'aht Qul challenge? I am familiar with the B'aht Qul. My spinal support is a poly-alloy designed to withstand extreme stress. My skull is composed of cortonide and uranium. I understand your intellectual prowess is equally impressive. If I were to learn the result of the computer search before the rest, the Klingon Empire would have a strategic advantage. A being of your abilities would go far in the Empire. You are attempting to bribe me. Not at all. You suggested a plan to your advantage, one I could execute. You then implied a reward. Commander... never mind. What the hell...? Computer, run a diagnostic on the primary defensive systems. La Forge to Capt Picard. What is it? I've found something I think you should see. The analysis is complete. The computer found this geometric pattern based on the fragments. Computer, highlight the section of the missing pattern. The missing DNA fragment should be in this system. The star is in the Rahm-lzad system. Direct hit on our port nacelle. They are powering up for another volley. Make it look good. Release the dampers. Aye, sir. They are firing. Report, Number One. We used the inertial dampers to simulate complete shield failure. Good thing you discovered Gul Ocett tampering with your defences. Maht-H'a, status. Minor damage to starboard nacelle. We will be operational in one hour. What?! You incompetent top'a! You were supposed to be prepared. The Cardassians have set a course for Rahm-lzad. They'll soon realize Rahm-lzad is the wrong planet. Captain, you're very welcome to join us. I... will go with you. Set in a course for the Vilmoran system, warp nine. Engage! I am scanning all seven planets. None supports life. How can that be? Correction. One shows evidence of an ancient ocean, now dry. It once supported life. Yes. And it still may. In a limited fashion, not detectable by sensors. Lay on a course, Ensign. Riker to transporter room one. We've located a planet that may still support life. Any sign of the Cardassians? Not yet. Acknowledged. I detect vegetative life, a primitive lichen in a fossilized sea bed. Transporter room one, stand by. Over there! We have company. I'm ready to pull you out. Wait for my order. You dishonourable top'a! Perhaps we could exchange insults some other time. It was quite a chase, wasn't it? How...? We intercepted communiqués between the Yridians and Cardassia. We were watching when Professor Galen was attacked. And you have been shadowing us ever since. And now the reward. Step clear, please. I shall destroy the entire rock face and every trace of DNA with it. You'll go to Romulus empty-handed. Your superiors will be pleased. Perhaps we could compromise? You give us the gene code... The sea bed may be only partially fossilized. It could still contain organic material. Which would still contain the DNA. I will not be eliminated now. You can be, by a disruptor. What about my offer? How can I be sure you won't kill me? I've given you my word. Etched in stone. No deals! There will be no deals as long as I am alive. Do not press me, Klingon. I don't care whether you live or die. If you fire, others will die. The program has been activated. It's reconfiguring the tricorder. We will die together, brother. It's modifying the diode emitter to project something. You're wondering who we are, why we have done this, how it is come that I stand before you, the image of a being from so long ago. Life evolved on my planet before all others in this part of the galaxy. We left our world, explored the stars and found none like ourselves. Our civilization thrived for ages, but what is the life of one race compared to the vast stretches of cosmic time? We knew that one day we would be gone, that nothing of us would survive. So, we left you. Our scientists seeded the primordial oceans of many worlds where life was in its infancy. The seed codes directed your evolution toward a physical form resembling ours. This body you see before you which is, of course, shaped as yours is shaped, for you are the end result. The seed codes also contain this message, which we scattered on many different worlds. It was our hope that you would have to come together in fellowship and companionship to hear this message. And if you can see and hear me, our hope has been fulfilled. You are a monument, not to our greatness, but to our existence. That was our wish... that you, too, would know life and would keep alive our memory. There is something of us in each of you and so, something of you in each other. Remember us. That's all?! If she were not dead, I would kill her! The very notion that a Cardassian could have anything in common with a Klingon turns my stomach. Picard to Enterprise. Standing by. Captain's log, stardate 46735.2. Use of high warp has over-extended the propulsion systems. We are finishing repairs before returning to Federation territory. It's sad Professor Galen didn't see the end of his study. No one would have appreciated it more. If it hadn't been for you, his dream would never have been realized. You left him a wonderful legacy. A more fitting message if it had not fallen on such deaf ears. You never know! Well, I have to get this day started. Both of us! See you this afternoon. Riker to Capt Picard. Transmission from the Romulans. Put it through. Acknowledged. Captain, my ships are leaving orbit for Romulan space. Until our next encounter. Until then. It would seem that we are not completely dissimilar after all. In our hopes, or in our fears... Yes. Well, then. Perhaps... one day. One day. (ENGLISH) "
S6E21,"You're absolutely right, Doctor. Right now, I can't imagine ever hurting anybody. How do you feel about that person you used to be? I feel terrible. But thanks to you, I'm doing much better now. I'm confident that when I leave, I will be ready to take my place in society. When do you think that will be? Well, now. Right away. Why do you say that? You said that when I was able to accept what I'd done and I understood the consequences of my actions, I would be free to go. Free to go? You don't think you should stand trial for what you did? No, I'm looking forward to proving my innocence. I thought you said you accepted what you did. No. That's not what I meant. I was sick when it happened. I wasn't responsible for what I did. How do I know you're not just telling me what I want to hear? We should continue this discussion next week. No, I wanna talk about this now! You're starting to sound angry again. Maybe you need another treatment. What I need is to get out of this cell. I've been here for days. You've controlled my every move. Told me what to eat, think and say. When I show a glimmer of independent thought, you strap me down, inject me with drugs. You call it a treatment! You are becoming agitated. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity but I'm not insane. There isn't any... There isn't... There's nothing... I'm sorry. Could we go back to ""You're becoming agitated""? No. Why don't we break for tonight? I think we've made progress. I'm still not comfortable with that speech. There's such a thing as over-rehearsing. You'll be fine. I don't know. Maybe I'm just not right for this part. Most humanoids have the potential to be irrational. Attempt to access that part of your psyche. Thank you, Data. Your character feels as if the world's against him. Like my first year at the Academy. Yes. That's your character. But I want you, Will Riker, to relax. I'll do my best. You're gonna knock 'em dead. Right. You control my every move. You tell me what to say, what to think. What to eat, what to say... What to think, what to eat... Then when I show a glimmer of independent thought, you strap me down, inject me, call it a treatment. I may be surrounded by insanity but I am not insane! Excuse me. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Tilonus IV? Didn't their government collapse? It's total anarchy. When the Prime Minister was assassinated, a Federation research team was on the planet. It's believed they were forced into hiding. Your mission will be to locate and evacuate them. Can't they go to the authorities? There are none. The government is splintered. It seems there are various factions vying for power. They're desperate for weapons or technology of any kind. Apparently, some of the factions have resorted to torture to gather their information. A Starfleet team will be a prime target. I'll have to go down there alone, under cover. Agreed. Mr. Worf will give you a briefing on Tilonian culture. Well, I guess I'll have to back out of Beverly's play. No. There will be plenty of time for that. We don't arrive on Tilonus for five days. Besides, if you back out, she'll come after me to play the part. This is the last known location of the team. They had occupied a building in the southwest. Begin there. That's over 200 square kilometers. A lot of land for one man to cover. I guess I'll pack extra boots. This apparel will help you pass as a common merchant. This Tilonian pendant is equipped with a communicator circuit. Doesn't really match the outfit. I suggest you pay closer attention. Your life will be at stake. Do you understand? Of course I do. Because you will be posing as a merchant, you will need to know how to use the nisroh for bartering. You will be judged on your prowess with a blade. I'm sorry! I did not intend... It's OK. I guess I wasn't paying attention. I'll go to sickbay. We'll continue this later. Boy, you will do anything to get out of this play. You'll have to do better than this. The play's not till tomorrow night. I've got 24 hours. Don't get any ideas. I will see you on stage at 1800 hours. Right. That still hurts. There was no damage to the nerve, so you shouldn't feel pain. Probably just a symptom of stage fright. It hurts! He was working on a conduit. A plasma torch blew up in his hands. It hurts! Please! Hypospray. Yes, Doctor. Get me 20cc of opporozine. Treat the surface burns. Yes, Doctor. Should we get a stasis unit? Have one standing by. Get me an epidermal sample. Begin dermal regeneration. Have tissue regrowth standing by. I've been on a lot of missions, seen people injured, but I have never been affected like this. He was looking right at me. That was disturbing to you? It was as if he was blaming me. This wasn't the only incident. The last several days, I've felt everybody's been staring at me or talking about me. It's as if I was in Frame of Mind, Frame of Mind? Beverly's play. Ever since I began rehearsing, I've been uneasy and restless. You're drawing on feelings you're not used to expressing. Right. The play is full of disturbing images. People losing their minds, being tortured by doctors. I can't get it out of my mind. Sometimes it's healthy to explore the darker side of the psyche. Jung called it ""owning your own shadow"". This could be a sign that you're a real actor. This is becoming more than a role. Maybe you're right. Don't be afraid of your darker side. Have fun with it. Who was that? You just missed him. Is there a new lieutenant? I'm not sure. Should I check? No. I'll check tomorrow. I'm going to bed. The performance is tomorrow night. I'm looking forward to it. Break a leg. I'll try not to take you literally. You're becoming agitated. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity but I am not insane. Nothing you or anyone else can say will change that! And I won't let you tell me that I am. You may be able to destroy my mind. But you can't change the fact that I'm innocent. I didn't kill that man! And that's what's driving you crazy. I can see we have a lot of work to do. Nothing you can say will change the fact I'm innocent! I'm not crazy! I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy. Bravo! Bravo! Well done! I can see we have a lot of work to do. Where am I? How did you get me off the ship? The ship again? What's going on? I understand this must be disturbing for you, but try to relax. Tell me, where were you a moment ago? I was on the Enterprise, in the middle of a play. But it was here. It was not real, it was on a stage. I can assure you, this is not a stage. Do you remember your name? I'm Commander... Commander... A second ago, I knew who I was. I was on the ship. I was in a play. Now I'm having trouble remembering anything. That's good. You're coming out of your delusional state. Delusional? It was not a delusion. I was there. We discussed this. Do you remember, we contacted Starfleet and asked them about you? No. We spoke with Admiral Budrow. Starbase 29. He had never heard of me. They had no officer that fit my description. That's right. Now, I want you to focus on who I am. Do you remember me? I don't know. I'm Dr Syrus. Do you remember anything about where you are now? My head hurts. Somebody hit me. You tried to escape. You struggled with an attendant and hit your head. Remember? Yes. I remember that now. I thought a Klingon had cut me. That's called transposition. You're projecting elements from your delusions onto real events. But that's good. There was a time when you couldn't break away from your starship fantasy at all. Now, ... ..if what you say is true, ... ..where am I? You're in ward 47 of the Tilonus Institute For Mental Disorders. Why am I here? We'll talk more later. You don't have to remember everything today. You're making excellent progress. Wait! Good afternoon. I've got some good news for you. Dr Syrus suggested that you might enjoy a couple of hours in the common area today. Well? I guess so. I hope you're hungry. They're serving spiny lobe-fish today. You won't need that. That's what you said last time. I'll be back with your lunch. I hear you're a Starfleet officer. I'm Cmdr Bloom from the Yorktown. There are a dozen of us here, maybe more. We were kidnapped. Brought here against our will. Sanders was on the Yosemite. They did something to his mind. I think they're trying to get neurochemicals from our brains. Stafko was on the Yorktown. I don't know what they did to him. We're going to get out of here. I've made a communicator. You have? Yes. There are three starships in orbit. They will beam us out. I'll ask them to get you out, too. Cmdr Bloom to Yorktown. Come in, Yorktown. I've made contact with another officer. Talking to your starship, Jaya? No. Don't let them tell you you're crazy. You know you're not supposed to take utensils from the common area. You're welcome to try. I'm not that far gone, am I? Of course you are. Your name is Mavek. That's right. Not bad for a crazy man. I am beginning to remember certain things. Why am I here? I remember when they brought you in. You were struggling, screaming. We could barely hold you down. In fact, just getting the blood off your hands took over an hour. Blood? On your hands, clothes. You didn't just kill that man, you mutilated him. What? I didn't kill anybody. I'm afraid you did. You stabbed him. They found you near the body, the knife in your hand. No! It's not true! Yes, it is. And if you ever get out, you'll stand trial. You're lying! I imagine the punishment will be severe, considering you stabbed him nine times. No! I was there. I was in ward 47, just like in the play. Everyone thought I was insane, that I had killed someone. But it was all real. Deanna mentioned that you were anxious about the play, but I had no idea. You said that in your dream, we performed the play. How did it go? It was a smash. We got a standing ovation. Let's hope it goes that well tonight. Well, we have one hour before curtain. How are you feeling? I feel like an actor. Well, you're certainly beginning to look the part. We should continue this discussion next week. No. I wanna talk about this now. You're starting to sounding angry. Maybe you need another treatment. What I need is to get out of this cell! I've been here for days. You've controlled my every move. Told me what to eat, think, say. When I show a glimmer of independent thought... When I show a glimmer of independent thought, you strap me down, inject me with drugs and call it a treatment! You're becoming agitated. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. What's happening? I can see we have a lot of work to do. Nothing you can do will change the fact that I'm innocent! I'm not crazy! I'm not... You're the key to all this, aren't you? Who are you? Lt Suna, sir. Will, are you alright? Yes. I don't know. Why don't we get him to sickbay? There's nothing wrong neurologically. I can't find anything that could cause hallucinations. But your heart rate is up. Your blood pressure is above normal. You are physically exhausted. This is not simple fatigue. Will, when you're under extreme stress, the mind can manufacture all kinds of things. Drugs. They injected me with drugs. See if the drug's in my system. Nothing. In that dream, they gave me drugs. Didn't anyone else at the theatre see anything strange happen? No. Nobody. Get some rest. The play is over. Don't give it another thought. Right. How's Lt Suna? Shaken, but alright. I feel like such an idiot. Don't be embarrassed. We're your friends. We know the stress you've been under. I'm sure everyone understands. Commander, I must congratulate you on your performance. Your choice to improvise was an effective method of drawing the audience into your character. You gave a realistic interpretation of multi-infarct dementia. Thank you. Well, maybe not everyone understands. I think I'd better get a little rest. Clear my mind. I want you to try some relaxation techniques. Remember them? They never work for me. Maybe you need another treatment. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing. Will, I want you to get some sleep. I'll see you tomorrow. OK. It's not real. It's not real. Don't let them tell you you're crazy. No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Help me! Help me. I need help. I don't want to be at the mercy of these hallucinations. You accept that you're not from a starship? It's a delusion? All I know is, when I go back to the ship, reality breaks apart. Nothing makes sense. When it's over, it fades like a dream. But when I'm in the hospital, everything seems real. I remember everything that happens here. What about how you got here? Maybe I did kill someone. I don't know. But I want to know how. I'm glad to hear you say that. I've had a talk with the hospital administrator. He said there are legal questions that have to be resolved soon. Meaning? Meaning we can't keep you here much longer. We're the only mental-health facility on Tilonus IV. We have many people who need help. I don't want to put stress on you, but we have to settle this case one way or another within a few days. What does that mean? You're facing a choice. We can help you remember what happened using reflection therapy. If it's successful, you'd be fit to stand trial. Reflection therapy? It's a way for you to interact with various facets of your personality. We scan the regions of your brain that control emotions and memory and project them holographically. What is the second option? A complete synaptic reconstruction of your cerebral cortex. Surgery. We would neutralize the synaptic pathways responsible for your mental instability. It doesn't sound like you care for that. I don't. The procedure is irreversible. You'd be left with a completely altered personality. The person you are now would cease to exist. Option one is beginning to sound better. I agree. Reflection therapy, then. When do we begin? This afternoon, if you're ready. I want you to understand that this won't be easy. You'll interact with aspects of your psyche you've never dealt with before, and... And you may be disturbed by what they say. Close your eyes. Try to relax. Clear your mind. Now, think back to before you came to the hospital. Don't try to remember specific incidents. Concentrate on how you felt. I was afraid. Terrified. She was with me on the ship. She represents an aspect of your personality. There are parts of you that still believe you're on that starship. Why her? I asked you about your feelings. This is the part of you that responded. Talk to her about before you came here. You said I was terrified. Of what? I was in a dark place. Cold. Frightened. Someone was there. Who? I felt threatened by them. Trapped. You're doing very well. Let's find out how you responded to these feelings. Try to focus on your actions. You felt trapped. What did you do? I was angry. They were attacking me. I fought back. I felt pain. I was injured. I panicked. There was a struggle and I... You what? What happened? Try to associate your actions and emotions with logical thoughts. What do you think caused you to act and feel this way? It was cold and dark because... ..I was outdoors. At night. I was in a narrow place. I was walking through an alley. I felt threatened. I was being watched. Someone must have followed me into the alley. That's why I started to walk faster. Someone grabbed me from behind. I panicked. I tried to fight them off. How many were there? Three. Humanoid. I only saw the face of one of them. What did he look like? I saw him on the ship, too. I saw him in the hospital, but I don't know who he is. That's Mr. Suna, the hospital administrator. You met when you arrived. What part of me does he represent? I don't know. Don't believe this, Will. None of it's real. You're still on the Enterprise. Doctor? We're your colleagues. You can trust us. Everything will be alright. Do you have anything to say to them? You're all delusions! Do not listen to him, Commander. He is trying to trick you. You are in danger here. Let us help you. Listen to me, Will. In all the years we've known each other, have I ever lied? No. Please. Leave me alone! Will, please. No! You've taken a big step today. You turned your back on those delusions and all they represent. We'll continue later. It's not real. Commander. Do you know who I am? Do you know where you are? If you can't answer, just listen. You were on an undercover mission to Tilonus IV. Something happened. We were told you killed somebody. We do not believe it. We're being blocked at every turn. The hospital administrator denies you're here at all. We're beginning to think that there's some sort of conspiracy. I had to pose as a health official. Sit tight, Commander. We will get you out of here. Not real. Commander. Get away from me! Commander, come with us. You are in danger. No! Silence. Commander, are you alright? Help me! Help me! Who are you? Take them to Security. Worf to Enterprise. Pattern enhancer activated. Three to beam up. Acknowledged. There's damage to the parietal lobe. It's as if someone's trying to access his long-term memory. He's in a severe state of neural shock. It's gonna take him a while to recover. Number One, do you remember what happened? You were abducted during the mission to Tilonus IV and put into a psychiatric hospital. It's still bleeding. It's minor. Don't worry about it. We have been checking on the hospital administrator. Mr. Suna. It appears that he's involved with one of the rival factions. We believe that he is responsible for what happened to you. It still hurts. It's bleeding again. Why? You just healed it! Will, try to calm down. This isn't real! What are you doing? If I'm right, you're not really here. This isn't a real phaser. It's all a fantasy. And I'll end it, no matter what. What if it isn't a fantasy? Are you willing to take that chance? You're right. I won't. But I'll find out what's real. Will, don't! How's he progressing? He's not responding to reflection therapy. His delusions are growing more elaborate. He broke out of his cell. We found him running down a corridor, claiming people had come to take him back to his starship. Then I see no other choice. We'll have to perform the synaptic reconstruction. I still have a phaser. Why? It's not a phaser, it's a knife. You stole it from a food tray. Give it to me. We don't want you to hurt yourself. I don't believe you. If this is a knife, where's Mavek? It's complicated. I'll answer all your questions. But first, put that down. No. If this is a real phaser, then I was on the Enterprise. But I fired it on myself, so I should be dead. None of this is real. I'm setting this to level 16, wide field. That should destroy this building. Unless, of course, this isn't a real phaser. It's all about you. You're the only constant in both places. There's a lot more going on here than you realize. This isn't real, either. What's happening to me? Listen to me. We can still save you, but you must stop fighting us. You're lying! Let me help you. No! I'm warning you. No! Bravo! Bravo! He's conscious! I haven't finished the neurodrain. Get him sedated! Riker to Enterprise! Enterprise. Are you alright? Emergency transport. Get me out of here. Captain's log, stardate 46778. 1. Cmdr Riker has returned safely from his mission to Tilonus IV. Dr Crusher has repaired the damage to his long-term memory. Evidently, you were abducted two days after beaming to the surface. I remember now. I was in an alley. They attacked from behind. I tried to fight them off with the nisroh. I managed to get one off me but they injected me with a drug. We believe they tried to extract information from your memory using a neurosomatic technique. I was in a hospital, then on the Enterprise. I was back in the hospital, shifting from place to place. I couldn't tell what was real. Your mind must have created a defence mechanism that helped you resist the neurosomatic process. Your unconscious fastened on to elements of your real life in an attempt to keep you grounded. To keep you sane. The preparation for the mission, the play. Those were recent memories, fresh in my mind. You should rest. We can talk tomorrow. There is one thing I'd like to do first. Are you sure you want to do this by yourself? The stage crew and I do it tomorrow. I'm positive. After everything, I couldn't sleep knowing it was still up. (ENGLISH) "
S6E22,"Alright, come in! Guinan, what's wrong? l need a doctor. Geordi beat me in straight sets. l think l have tennis elbow. Well, you better go to sickbay. l think Dr Selar's on duty. l don't want to see Dr Selar. l'm particular about my doctors. You better get a new one. l'm not a doctor on this ship any more.      A three-day shuttle to Starbase 23, transport back to Earth. l can hear Admiral Brooks telling me how l've disgraced Starfleet Medical. Then a day and a half before the inquiry begins and my career ends. Beverly? My elbow. Your elbow. Let me see it. Does this hurt? Yes, right there. That's tennis elbow alright. Here, hold your arm like this. You know, l've never been to a formal inquiry. l'll see if l can arrange one for you! All you have to do is disobey orders, violate medical ethics and cause an interstellar incident. l guess that would do it. Make a fist. Do l have to hit you with my fist before you tell me what happened? lt started when those scientists came on board. No. lt started when l got curious. Nothing wrong with that. That's why l went to the Altine Conference. l'd heard of a subspace technology developed by a Ferengi, a Dr Reyga. A Ferengi scientist. His invention was based on metaphasic fields, but his methodology was most unorthodox. l like unorthodox. Too bad you weren't there. Nobody else would listen to him. They all but jeered him off the stage. But l had read his paper and his work was extraordinary. So you gathered all these scientists to come hear this Ferengi. Yes. l hoped l could be a facilitator. l thought if l invited scientists from various cultures, l could help them to understand the value of his ideas. Like a scientific diplomat. Exactly. After asking the Captain, l rounded up as many scientists as l could from the field of subspace technology.              You've all seen my experimental data. The metaphasic shield has been proven. Forgive my scepticism, Doctor, but your claims are extravagant. Protect a shuttle within a star's corona? Not even your government believes it. That's why l've invited you all here. You have the vision to see the potential of the metaphasic shield. l need help to develop the shield. l will grant exclusive rights to whoever provides the resources. l think you all realise what this shielding process could mean. The possibilities of exploration and research are endless. But only if it works. l'm not convinced this metaphasic shield can withstand the temperature or the radiation it would be exposed to. But it has! Not only in countless simulations, but in a field test that l conducted myself. For which, of course, we have only your word. Are you accusing me of falsifying my data? You would not be the first scientist to manipulate experimental data. Dr Reyga has offered to demonstrate his invention. He's outfitted one of our shuttles with his shield. l will take it into the corona of the star Vaytan. That star has a dense corona and would emit very intense radiation. lt would be wise to choose a star of lesser magnitude. l agree. My own research suggests Vaytan's corona is extremely unstable. What better way to test my invention? l'm not concerned. The shield will hold. l for one would feel more comfortable if someone else flew the shuttle. Someone more objective. l will volunteer for that. l've spent years studying solar-plasma reactions. The thought of being able to penetrate a star's corona. lt is a remarkable opportunity. l've studied your data, Dr Reyga. You're on solid scientific ground. l do not share your optimism, but if you wish to pilot the craft, l would be more confident in your assessment than Dr Reyga's. l agree. We need an impartial evaluation. You'll have to know the controls and Dr Reyga's modifications. l am an accomplished pilot. lt will be no problem. Well, what do you think? l am gratified, Dr Jo'Bril. lt will not be difficult to operate the metaphasic controls. The system activates automatically as you approach the star. Well, then, we'll proceed at 1 500 hours. We'll meet on the bridge.    l thought it went well. Didn't you? Thanks to you, Doctor. l didn't do anything. This is a chance l would never have had without you. l won't forget it. Some of them still seem doubtful, but l'm sure they'll come around. lf l'm used to anything, it's scepticism. After all, a Ferengi scientist is almost a contradiction in terms. No, don't deny it. l know how the Ferengi are regarded. l still expect the scientific community to be a little more open. Well, the shield is a breakthrough. Many have tried to develop it. lt's only natural that there would be some resistance. You mean jealousy. l know. That might account for Dr T'Pan's attitude. She's been working on that technology for years and you beat her to it. l'm not interested in competition. All l want is to be acknowledged. Respected as a scientist. This invention will finally do that.    Captain, the shuttle has been launched. On screen. Open a channel.    The metaphasic shielding has begun to form. External temperature is 0.9 million Kelvins and rising. Radiation levels are nearing 1 0,000 rads. That shouldn't effect the shuttle. That's right. Cabin temperature is 21 degrees and the radiation levels are normal.  Those are from the subspace field around the shuttle. Well within acceptable parameters. Outside temperature rising rapidly. 1 .7 million Kelvins. Temperature is still 21 degrees and the shield is holding.   Congratulations, Doctor. This is an amazing achievement. Radiation levels outside the shuttle are nearing 1 4,000 rads. Cabin temperature is still normal.  You see, Doctors? Metaphasic shielding is a reality. Dr Jo'Bril, can you give us an estimate of the plasma turbulence? Dr Jo'Bril? Something's wrong. What's going on, Mr Data? Sensors indicate increased baryon particles in the cabin. No! That's not possible. Dr Jo'Bril, can you hear me? Please respond. Baryon levels are continuing to rise, sir. l don't understand. This shouldn't happen! Mr Worf, can you beam him out? The solar radiation is interfering. He must be at least 500,000 kilometres from the star before we can get a transporter lock. We're losing him. Dr Jo'Bril, listen to me. lt is imperative that you turn the shuttle. Take it out of the corona. Do you understand me? Pilot the shuttle away from the star. The shuttle is emerging. Mr Worf, get a lock on him. Beam him directly to sickbay.      20cc inaprovaline. lt's not working. Cortical stimulators. Now. Again. l saw the sun. So that was my first experience as a scientific diplomat. A complete failure. l don't understand. No? l mean, l've lost patients before. But this was different. You know, when you're a doctor and you have patients, you're in control. But when you send somebody on a mission, all you can do is sit and watch. That's what l felt. Helpless. Anybody would. Don't be too hard on yourself. What you say reminds me of something Jean-Luc said to me when l was doing the autopsy on Jo'Bril.    How's it going? l've never run into a humanoid species like this before. His internal physiology is baffling. He doesn't seem to have any discrete organs, not in the traditional sense. Practically every system is equally distributed throughout the body. That should make him incredibly resistant to any injury. So whatever killed him occurred at the cellular level. Any idea what it was? No. Something caused a system-wide failure, but l don't know what. Were the solar radiation levels high enough to kill him? His exposure to the star's radiation was minimal. lt's all very strange. There's no apparent cause of death. Doctor, here's the result of the tissue scan you asked for. That's odd. The rate of cellular decay is extremely low. Beverly, the answers will come. Maybe even minimal exposure to radiation altered the cellular physiology. You know, you've been at this for hours. You need a good night's sleep. l can't sleep. l want to find out what killed him. l owe that to Dr Reyga. You're doing it for him or yourself? What do you mean? You're the loneliest person in the world now. No one can say anything, no one can do anything that will help. And you think it will never go away. And you're right, it won't. But you can get used to it. l know it doesn't feel like that now, but you can.         Run a diagnostic on the EPS flow regulator. The flow regulator is functioning normally. And the fuel emitter? Has it maintained polarity? Yes. The radial-force compensator? l cannot locate any malfunctions. All systems are operating according to your design specifications. Did you find anything? No. There must be something we've overlooked. l've found damage to the hull. That confirms your shield was breached by baryonic radiation. Were the levels high enough to damage tissue? l don't know. Perhaps there was an interaction between the radiation and the shield. No, that's not possible! l anticipated every contingency. Then maybe Jo'Bril ran into something which you didn't anticipate and your shield just wasn't able to protect him. My shield was not at fault.    ln light of what happened, it would be inappropriate to continue further testing. lf Dr Reyga perfects his metaphasic technology, we can try again. Dr Crusher, please. lf l could have a little more time to investigate, l could find what went wrong. But that won't bring back Jo'Bril, will it? l do not believe the shield will ever work. lts very concept is flawed. Just one more test. Whom do you propose we sacrifice next? l will pilot the shuttle myself. l'm sorry. l'm responsible for the health and safety of all the people aboard. l will not authorise further tests. Very well. But l will prove myself!      Look at this. A plasma infuser. lt's completely discharged. lt must have killed him instantly. Perhaps he could not live with his failure and took his own life. Or perhaps someone just wanted it to look that way. lsn't it odd he held on so tightly to the infuser when it was discharged? The normal reflex would be to drop it. lt could have affected his nervous system, causing him to grip tighter. l'll know when l do the autopsy. ls your examination complete? For now. Have his body taken to the morgue. Very well.     l was with him right before he died. He was not suicidal. But by your own admission, Reyga was a difficult man to understand. lsn't it possible that he was simply masking his feelings? l don't think so. He was disappointed at the failure of his device and he was upset at Jo'Bril's death, but l never felt he was ready to end his own life. lf that's true, then someone killed him. Do you have any evidence of that? Not yet. But when l finish the autopsy, l hope l'll have it. Beverly. l'm afraid there will be no autopsy. The family were contacted. They insist he must not be touched until they perform the death ritual. But there's a question as to how he died. To them it's irrelevant. l'll speak to them. Believe me, they're adamant. We rendezvous with a Ferengi vessel in 1 7 hours. They will pick up Reyga's body then. Sorry. There will be no autopsy. Jean-Luc, l cannot just drop this. Don't you see? There may have been a murder. Then you will have to find evidence some way other than an autopsy. lsn't it pretty clear that Reyga died from a plasma discharge? lt won't be clear until after an autopsy. He could have been poisoned and had the infuser put in his hand after he died. He was murdered? l don't discount the possibility. Without a complete autopsy, there's no way to know for certain. Why won't the Ferengi allow it? lt's their death rituals. A body can't be violated before it's buried. The family cares more about ritual than finding out how he died. l just can't get the information l need from a tricorder scan. Suspects. lf Reyga didn't kill himself, someone else did. So who are the possible suspects? Whoever would gain from his death. The only ones to fit that category are the other scientists. l don't understand. Do you have evidence that Reyga was murdered? No, but l can't believe he took his own life and l would like to explore any possibilities. Why would anyone kill him? l was wondering if you had some thoughts along that line. l see. You are suggesting that l had such a motive. Had Reyga's technology been successful, you might have been displaced as the top scientist in your field. But since it wasn't successful, it's illogical to say l had such a motive. l must say l resent this, Doctor. We have all been shocked by recent events. There's nothing to gain by dragging us through these insinuations. l'm just trying to uncover the truth and l need your help to do it. Have you seen or heard anything that might suggest someone else had a motive? We want to forget the unpleasantness of these past several days, not have it stirred up again. l find it disturbing that you would try to foster suspicions among us. Forgive me. l don't mean to upset you. But have you noticed anything unusual? l find your question distasteful. ls there something you're not telling me? l'm sure it's nothing. l was in the science-laboratory store room yesterday. Kurak was working in the lab. Reyga came in and they got into an argument. About what? l don't know. l couldn't hear anything clearly until they started to shout at one another. Then l heard Kurak say that Reyga had insulted her honour and no Klingon would stand for that. l do not believe she killed him. These were words spoken in anger. Kurak is volatile, passionate, but not a killer. And, Doctor, neither are we. Thank you.    That looks like one of Dr Reyga's shield configurations. Yes. Personal research. Even though this technology failed? No one has denied there is potential in the idea. Which you're now free to develop. Are you accusing me of something? No. But l want to know why you threatened Dr Reyga. l warned Dr Reyga that if he persisted in his slander, he would pay the price. What was his accusation? l will not repeat his lies. Were they lies? Be careful, Doctor. lnsulting the honour of a Klingon can be extremely dangerous. Did Reyga make that mistake? l have heard enough of your accusations! Now l will have your silence! Well, you'll have to throw me a lot harder than that. Now, what did he accuse you of? Sabotage. Of the metaphasic shield? Was that why it failed? How would l know? Did you sabotage the project? No. l did not. Goodbye, Doctor!              Come. Beverly. This is something you need to know, but you're not gonna like it. l did an autopsy on Dr Reyga. What did you find? Nothing. l'm sorry. l know l shouldn't have done it. You most certainly should not. l made it clear that the family would not allow it. Not only have you disobeyed my orders, but you've interfered in the rituals of another culture. You've put both of us in a difficult position. The family will have to be notified. l don't doubt that they will react strongly. lf the Ferengi government becomes involved, as l'm certain they will, this could have very significant repercussions. l'm not sure how much l can protect you. You don't have to, Jean-Luc. l knew what l was doing and l'm prepared to accept the consequences.   So that's the story. That's how l ended my career. Backhand volley. What? That's how l did it. Geordi kept hitting to my backhand. Guinan, two people died on this ship, two lives ended horribly, and you're worried about your tennis game? Are you upset? You tell me. You're supposed to be wise. lf you are upset, why mope here? Why don't you do something about it? l've done all l could think of. lt got me fired. You think Dr Reyga killed himself? No. You think a murderer is on board? Yes. Then why are you sitting here? lf l start digging around again... You could be relieved of duty.    What are you doing? l am running diagnostics to make sure there was no permanent radiation damage to the shuttle hull. You've studied Dr Reyga's shield system. Do you think it was sabotaged? There was no evidence to support that. Just consider the possibility. Access to the circuitry is prevented unless the shield emitter is active. Any attempt at sabotage had to be made with the shield in operation. The only time the shield was active was during the test flight. Correct. lt is unlikely Jo'Bril would perform sabotage resulting in his own death. l agree. Would it be possible to sabotage the shuttle by remote during the flight? A phased ionic pulse beamed into the metaphasic matrix would result in a temporary system malfunction. Where on board could you generate such a pulse? lt could be initiated from the lateral sensor array, science labs one, four and 1 6, or the bridge science stations. Let's assume someone did send out a phased ionic pulse. What would have happened inside the shuttle? A tetryon field would be formed in the cabin, disrupting the metaphasic shield. A tetryon field? lf Jo'Bril was exposed to a tetryon field, it might have left traces in his tissue. Thanks, Data. Beverly? Yes? The shuttle will take you to Starbase 23. You leave at 0700 hours tomorrow. Thank you. About everything that's going on. l'm sorry. l'm sure it will all work out. Of course. You know the inquiry is just a formality. Capt Picard will do all he can. l'm sure that'll help. But if you do anything foolish before that, it won't look good. l don't know what you mean. l think you do know what l mean. You ought to go to your quarters and read a good book. lf you make the situation worse, it'll be that much harder on you. Thank you. Your concern is noted. Beverly! l'm saying this to you as a friend. Yes, Will, l know. But, as a friend, please try to understand that l can't quit now and l don't want you to become involved in this. Computer, access ship's Medical logs and download current autopsy files.   Damn! Dr Crusher? What do you need the autopsy files for? Don't worry. l know l shouldn't be here. l'll go. Computer,... ..access autopsy files. You'll need the files on Dr Reyga and Jo'Bril? Alyssa... l can see this is important to you. l don't want you to get involved. ls that an order? Yes. Too bad you're not my boss now. Thank you. So what do we do now? Review the physiology records. Then look again at the body to see if there's any tetryon traces. Let's do it. We need to run a tissue scan at the molecular level. Calibrate the scanner to pick up tetryon particles. Yes, Doctor. Recalibration complete. Activate the scan. Nothing. Let's do it again. Use the enhanced resolution mode to boost the sensitivity. Something in the subdermal tissue. Narrow the scan field. Tetryon traces! Someone did sabotage the shield. That's a possibility, but this is very circumstantial evidence. There's only one way to know for certain. Captain, l'm concerned about Beverly. l've tried to talk to her but she's been avoiding me. l'm not surprised. This experience has been... Captain. An unscheduled launch is taking place in shuttlebay two. No idea. No one's filed a flight plan. On screen. That's the Justman, the shuttle Reyga modified. Open a hailing frequency. Dr Crusher, what do you think you're doing?  A theory?  Return to the ship immediately.  Mr Worf, override the shuttle's computer. Aye, sir. Sir, she has isolated her navigational control. Remote operation is not possible. Get a tractor beam on her. l cannot establish a lock. Solar interference is too high. Mr Data, what is her heading? Bearing 27 1 , mark four, sir. She is headed into the sun's corona.   What do you hope to accomplish?   You can't be certain. You're betting your life on a hypothesis.   Sir, the shuttle is entering the corona. What's happening?        Sir, we have lost contact. Crusher to Enterprise. l've lost you. Come in. Justman to Enterprise. Come in. Enterprise, do you hear me? They cannot hear you. l have severed communications. How can you be alive? l'd think after your autopsy on me you'd know the answer to that. The slow rate of cellular decay. lt is a natural result of physiostasis. Takarans can control their physiology at a cellular level. We can create the appearance of death. ln the morgue, you were conscious. You heard everything we said. You knew everything we were going to do. Move away. Move away. What are you doing? l'm sending out a transient subspace signal. lt will obscure the shuttle from the Enterprise sensors. They will interpret it as a warp-engine breach. They will believe that you have been destroyed. l'd like to thank you, Doctor. For what? All l wanted to do was discredit Reyga so that no one would pursue his technology except me. But you have given me more than l could have hoped. Now l can take the prototype itself back to Takara, where l will develop it into a weapon. All l need do is wait here until the Enterprise is convinced you are dead and leaves. Captain, there is no indication of debris. However, the subspace signal indicates a warp-engine breach. Begin a search, starting with the shuttle's last known coordinates. Plot a course toward the star. Sir, we are picking up an object emerging from the corona.      Hi, Guinan. Hello. Somebody's birthday? Not unless it's yours. lt's for you. What's the occasion? lt's a thank-you. For giving me a kick in the butt. Now, l didn't... l did some research. This is the latest design, state of the art. lt is specifically designed to cushion all vibrations, so you will never have tennis elbow again. Thank you, Doctor. This looks like a great racket, but l don't play tennis. Never have. (ENGLlSH) "
S6E23,"Good morning, Commander. Data. Interesting night? I found it extremely interesting. The lateral sensor arrays ran three spectral analyses on the Alawanir Nebula on three frequencies. I'm sorry I missed it. I will send you the report. We are still on course for the Gariman Sector. Our speed is warp six. ETA, 1300 hours. Sickbay reported one minor injury in exobiology at 0420 hours. Very well. Isn't Lt Worf scheduled to replace Ensign Torigan? Yes, sir. I was not informed of any change to the roster. He's never late. Riker to Lt Worf. Computer, locate Lt Worf. Lt Worf is in his quarters. Something's wrong. Mr. Data, you have the bridge. Security team, deck seven, section 25 Baker. Aye, sir. Computer, override security lock on this door. Authorization, Riker Alpha six zero. Worf, what the hell are you doing? Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Enter! Captain. On your feet, Lieutenant. Sir. Mr. Worf, your personal affairs are your concern until they interfere with this ship. You have crossed that line. As Captain, I want to know what is going on. It is difficult to explain. Try. Ever since I returned from the Carraya System, I have felt empty. Is this to do with the Klingons you rescued from Carraya IV? They were young. They knew nothing of their heritage. While I was there, I tried to teach them about their people, their culture. I told them our ancient stories, instructed them in our customs, explained our beliefs. Then I told them about Kahless, how he had united our people long ago, how he gave us strength and honour and how he promised to return one day and lead us again. Is that what you're doing here? Trying to recapture those feelings? Yes. I was trying to summon a vision of Kahless. Better to use the holodeck than setting fire to your quarters. Using the holodeck would not be appropriate. Everything had to be real if Kahless were to appear. But all this is for nothing. He did not come to me. I gave Toq and the others a belief in Sto-Vo-Kor, the life beyond this life where Kahless awaits us. When I saw the power of their beliefs, I began to question my own. And I found it wanting. Have you lost your faith in Sto-Vo-Kor? To lose something, one must first possess it. I am not sure I ever had a true belief. But it should not have interfered with my duties. My behaviour was... Inexcusable. And understandable. It may be that what you are looking for cannot be found here. Perhaps you need to immerse yourself in Klingon beliefs in order to discover if they can hold any truth for you. Is there something you could do, somewhere you could go, to explore your faith more fully? Boreth. The followers of Kahless await his return there. To Klingons, there is no more sacred place. Boreth is only 12 days from here by shuttle. As of this moment, you are on leave. Thank you, sir. But when you set foot on this ship again, I expect you to perform your duties like a Starfleet officer. Yes, sir. And, Mr. Worf? I hope you find what you're looking for. Thank you, sir. Kahless. I see Kahless. He is standing before me, with a sword. He wants something. Me. He wants me. He wants me to go with him. It is a powerful vision, Divok. Kahless wants you to join him in Sto-Vo-Kor. You are only 19, yet your place among the honoured dead is secure. Take him back to his chamber. Let him sleep. You're leaving us? It has been ten days, Koroth. I have had no visions. I have received no insight. There is nothing here for me. What is the Story of the Promise, Worf? When Kahless had united our people and gave them the laws of honour, he saw that his work was done. One night, he gathered his belongings and said goodbye. The people wept. They did not want him to go. Then Kahless said, ""You are Klingons."" ""You need no one but yourselves."" ""I will go now to Sto-Vo-Kor, but I promise one day I will return."" Then Kahless pointed to a star in the sky and said, ""Look for me there, on that point of light."" So, here we are, on a world circling that distant point of light. It has been 15 centuries since he made that promise, and still we wait. What are ten days in the life of one Klingon compared to that? Is the son of Mogh really so easily discouraged? You came to us seeking answers, but this is a place of questions. Open your heart to Kahless. Ask him your questions. Let him speak to you with your mind unclouded by doubt or hesitation. Only then can you find what you are looking for. If you cannot do that, then perhaps you should return to your starship. I see Kahless. You are real. I am Kahless. And I have returned. What are you doing? Who are you? It is Kahless. I have returned. You doubt me. Who here knows the story of how this sword was forged? No one knows. It is not written in the sacred texts. I went into the mountains, all the way to the volcano at Kri'stak. There I cut off a lock of my hair and thrust it into the molten rock that poured from the summit. The hair began to burn. Then I plunged it into the Lake of Lusor, and twisted it into this sword. And after I used it to kill Molor, I gave it a name. Bat'leth. The sword of honour. You know! The story of the sword is known only to the high clerics. It was never written down, so that if he returned, we could be sure it was Kahless. I have returned because there is a great need in my people. They fight amongst themselves in petty wars that corrupt the glory of the Klingon spirit. They have lost their way. But it is not too late. I have returned and I will lead my people again. Kahless. Kahless. What is it you are doing? I was getting my tricorder. Tricorder? Is it a weapon? No. It is a tool. I intended to use it... To see if I was real. Proceed. Use your tricorder. Well? You are Klingon. What else could I be? There are many possibilities. A shape shifter. A holographic projection. You are a sceptic, Worf. I like that. How do you know my name? We have met before. I appeared to you in a vision in the caves of No'Mat. You were just a child then. I told you that you would do something that no Klingon had ever done before. You still do not believe it is me, do you, Worf? I want to believe. That is a beginning. Gowron is the leader of the Council and the defence force. If he opposes you... Do not worry. We are on the threshold of a new era. Klingons from all over the Empire will flock to my banner. Yet something still weighs heavy on the brow of the son of Mogh. Are you contemplating yet another question for me? After three days, I wonder if you know how to do anything else. Questions are the beginning of wisdom, the mark of a true warrior. Do not forget that a leader need not answer questions of those he leads. It is enough that he says to do a thing and they will do it. If he says to run, they run. If he says to fight, they fight. If he says to die, they die. If the commander is worthy of trust. What is wrong? Is there only anger and bloodlust in your souls? Is that all that is left in the Klingon heart? We do not fight merely to spill blood, but to enrich the spirit. Look at us. Two warriors locked in battle, fighting for honour. How can you not sing for all to hear? We are Klingons! Yes. Let it out. Let the joy in your heart be heard. We are Klingons! We are Klingons. We are Klingons. Captain's log, stardate 46852.2. The Enterprise is to proceed to Boreth to take aboard a very unusual guest. Did you take any other tricorder readings, an anatomical profile or a neurophysiology scan? No. It's going to be difficult to eliminate possibilities now. He may be a coalescent being taking Klingon form, or a bioreplicant or a Klingon who has been surgically altered. There is another possibility. He could be the real Kahless. He may have returned as he promised. The appearance of Kahless is consistent with the sacred texts. Worf, no offence, but I have trouble believing the man on deck eight is supernatural. I did not say that he is. I merely think that we should not reject the possibility. Look, we have no reason to rule out anything. We are not ordered to investigate the origins of our guest, nor to tell anyone what to believe. We are simply to transport him to the Homeworld. And while he's here with us, he will be treated as an honoured guest. Lieutenant? May I ask a question? In the absence of empirical data, how will you determine if he is real? It is not an empirical matter. It is a matter of faith. Faith? Then you do believe Kahless has supernatural attributes? As an android, I am unable to accept that which cannot be proven. I would appreciate hearing your insights. Perhaps some other time, Commander. I do not believe I can provide much insight at this moment. Welcome aboard, Gowron. Where is he, Picard? I assume you are referring to Kahless. I am referring to the filthy pahtk who is using his name. Well, the person in question is in his quarters at the moment. What have you learned? What medical analysis have you made? Any theories about his origin? We haven't done any analysis. What fools work for you? The impostor has been aboard for a day. If you wanted tests, you should have sent a ship. And have him spread his lies through a ship of Klingons? Never. If he really is an impostor, don't worry. Kahless has been dead for 1,000 years. But the idea of Kahless is alive. Have you ever fought an idea? It has no weapon to destroy, no body to kill. The idea of Kahless's return must be stopped here or it will travel through the Empire like a wave, and leave nothing but destruction behind. So Gowron has come on board to test your claim. Gowron knows that his days are over. He comes crawling aboard with some test. We don't have to prove anything. What test? He has a knife, a knife that is stained with the blood of Kahless. Gowron has the Knife of Kirom? No one should remove it from the sacred vault. Gowron does not care what is sacred. He wants to run a genetic analysis on the blood and on you. That should tell us if there is a match. If you agree, I will ensure that it is conducted impartially. Perhaps it is time to settle the doubts of those who still do not believe. I will allow this test. There, that should do it. Computer, run a genetic comparison on this blood sample and the tissue belonging to Kahless. The genetic patterns are identical. But how? How can this be? It is true. Kahless has returned. I am sorry. Our replicator does not do justice to warnog. It's been so long since I have tasted any food or drink. There are many things I have forgotten. Kahless. May I ask you about death and Sto-Vo-Kor? Tell me, what awaits us beyond this life? I do not have those answers. I am merely a traveller who has journeyed back and forth between this world and the next. While I am in this form, I know only about this world. And there is much work for me to do in this world. And you will be part of it, Worf. Me? It was your purity of heart that summoned me back from Sto-Vo-Kor. Koroth has told me about the respect you've earned in the Federation and the Empire. I want you at my side as we restore honour to our people. Let me tell you about this new empire we will forge. It will be glorious! It will be war! No. You are not a fool. Do you really think that every Klingon will grovel before this man, just because Koroth says he is Kahless? He is Kahless. Your own test proved it. I will not hand over the Empire to Koroth because of one test. This is not Koroth. Of course it is! Open your eyes. Koroth and the other guardians have always opposed me. This is nothing more than a ploy to seize power. Even now, there are warriors on my own ship who want to see Kahless. There are others who believe he is an impostor. The divisions are already forming. But it does not have to be this way. We could join together and welcome Kahless as a united people. Don't you see? This is exactly why they want you to join them. Because your brother sits on the Council, and your voice carries weight in the Empire. They want you to influence others to follow them. Worf. We fought together once, side by side, to keep the Empire from being torn apart. Will you stand by and let these impostors destroy all that we fought so hard to protect? Renounce him, Worf. Stand with me and we can hold the Empire together. You do not understand. Kahless is our future. Only with his help can we revive the pure warriors within ourselves. Listen to him, Gowron. Open your heart. Hear his words. He will restore your faith as he has restored mine. Give him a chance to lift your spirit and cleanse your heart before you take up arms. Koroth. I see that not all fools die young. Kahless. Kahless, may I present Gowron, leader of the High Council? Kahless. Long ago, a storm was heading toward the city of Quin'lat. The people sought protection within the walls. All except one man who remained outside. I went and asked what he was doing. ""I am not afraid,"" he said. ""I will not hide my face behind stone and mortar."" ""I will stand before the wind and make it respect me."" I honoured his choice and went inside. The next day, the storm came and the man was killed. The wind does not respect a fool. Do not stand before the wind, Gowron. What was his name? What? If you were really there, you should be able to tell us the name of the man outside the walls. Describe him to us. What was he wearing? How tall was he? What colour were his eyes? I do not remember. It was long ago and in another lifetime. What matters is, I have returned to restore faith and hope to my people, to lead them back to the way of honour, and the glory that once was theirs and can be again. Is that what you oppose, Gowron? I oppose you. I say you are not Kahless. And I will not bend my knee to you as long as I can draw breath or pick up a blade. No. Koroth. A good try, Gowron. But not enough. You have no joy, Gowron. Is your heart so full of suspicion that you've forgotten what it means to be Klingon? Kahless. The greatest warrior of them all! Everything will be alright. We will say that Gowron used a dishonourable tactic. He cheated. That is a lie! We do not need to hear from you. You brought them together! I am Kahless, the strongest, bravest warrior. Do not think about what happened. You must think of the future. There is no future here. No glorious new era for our people. Gowron was right. You did not know the name of the man who faced the storm. You do not know what real warnog tastes like. And you certainly are not the greatest warrior. Whoever you are, you are not Kahless. You have said enough. Get out! You are using the name of Kahless for some twisted game. For that alone, you should die. If you do not tell me what you have done, I will kill you right here! The problems with your memory are the result of the way you returned. What do you mean? We, the guardians, have been awaiting your return for centuries, but we did not have the technology to bring you back. Until now. We used an organic sample of the first Kahless to give you life. The first Kahless? A clone. He is a clone. What is a clone? A being created in a laboratory by using genetic material from another being. You are a copy. A fraud! You are not just a copy. We gave you more than the body of Kahless. We found a way to imprint information in your neurosynaptic patterns. We gave you memories, not any memories. We gave you the experiences of Kahless, as written in sacred texts. So, I did not do any of the things that I remember. I was never in the city of Quin'lat. I never went to the Kri'stat volcano. You were not awakened until we transported you into the cave and you appeared to Worf. Before then, you were in a laboratory where we accelerated growth, corrected any genetic anomalies, gave you the wisdom and memories... They grew you in a test tube like some kind of fungus. And programmed you like a machine. You are twisting the truth. You talk to me of truth? You who brought to life this lie and called it Kahless. It is not a lie. Genetically, he is Kahless. And he is needed by our people. You know that corruption and dishonour are destroying the Empire. They need him. They do not need a false god. How do you know this is not the prophecy? Who is to say that what we did was wrong? I am. I will not let this fraud continue. Worf. You cannot tell Gowron. Do not give me orders. Alright. But consider this. If you tell Gowron what we have told you, it will destroy him. And with him, the last chance to restore hope to our people. It's your choice. They have been sitting here for three hours, 17 minutes. They refuse to return with the rest of Gowron's men. They insisted upon waiting here until they see Kahless again. Their faith is unaffected by his inability to defeat Gowron. They still believe. Then they are fools. Does that mean you no longer believe it is Kahless? Yes. I am curious. Do you still think the real Kahless will return? Or has this experience only deepened your spiritual crisis? I do not know. I understand your dilemma. I once had what could be considered a crisis of the spirit. You? Yes. The Starfleet officers who activated me on Omicron Theta told me I was an android, nothing more than a machine with human form. However, I realized that if I were simply a machine, I could never be anything else. I could never grow beyond my programming. I found that difficult to accept. So I chose to believe that I was a person. That I was more than a collection of circuits and subprocessors. It is a belief which I still hold. How did you come to your decision? I made a leap of faith. The man who appeared to me on Boreth is not Kahless. He is a clone. A clone? Yes. Did you really think you could get away with this fraud? You and this abomination will be put to death. It does not matter, Gowron. You will not be able to stand against him. What? He's not real. You just said so. I said he was not Kahless. But in the minds of our people, he can be just as powerful. Even now, two members of your own crew are sitting on our holodeck waiting for him. I do not care what they think. They are not alone. Like many of our people, they need something to believe in, like I did. Something larger than themselves, that will give their lives meaning. They need Kahless. When they find out the truth... It does not matter. Despite the facts, they will still believe. They will make a leap of faith. There will be others like them. Not everyone. But enough to plunge the Empire into civil war if you oppose them. What are you saying? I should hand over the Empire? No. That would be unwise, as well. Then what are you proposing, Worf? You were right about one thing, Koroth. Our people are becoming decadent and corrupt. They need moral leadership. Kahless can be that leader, as emperor. There hasn't been an emperor in three centuries. The political power will remain with the High Council. Kahless would be a figurehead, but he will have the ability to rally the people, to lead by example, to guide them in spiritual matters. The title is meaningless without power to back it up. Real power comes from within the heart. You would have the power to mould the Klingon heart. You could return them to honour according to the teachings of Kahless which are within you. It would be a great challenge, if you have courage to accept it. And what will we tell the people about their emperor? That he appeared in a cave or a laboratory? We will tell them the truth. All of the truth. But we will tell them that even if he is not the real Kahless, he is the rightful heir to Kahless. And if I refuse to go along? My brother, those who support him, and I will fight you. And the Empire will fall back into civil war. What do you say about this? What I say is unimportant. It is acceptable. Join with me, Gowron. Let us usher in this new era together. Kahless. Farewell, Worf. Goodbye. What's wrong? You should be proud of what you've accomplished. I went to Boreth to find my faith. For a time, I thought I had. But my heart is empty again. I do not know what to believe. You doubt the real Kahless will return one day? You doubt that he is still waiting for you in Sto-Vo-Kor? Kahless left us, all of us, a powerful legacy. A way of thinking and acting that makes us Klingon. If his words hold wisdom and his philosophy is honourable, what does it matter if he returns? What is important is that we follow his teachings. Perhaps the words are more important than the man. Qapla', son of Mogh. Qapla', Kahless. (ENGLISH) "
S6E24,"Captain's log, stardate 46915.2. The Enterprise is orbiting Nervala IV, waiting for an opportunity to retrieve scientific data left there by Starfleet researchers when they evacuated eight years ago. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Any requests tonight? Night Bird. Any requests? Night Bird. Ladies and gentlemen, Night Bird. One, two... What was that all about? Will's been trying to get this piece right for ten years. He's never made it through the solo. Here it comes. Data to Cmdr Riker. Go ahead. You are needed on the bridge. On my way. Saved by the bell. You wanted to see me? Yes, sir. We can transport to the surface sooner than anticipated. Is the distortion field rephasing early? No, sir. Using the Potemkin's logs from the original evacuation, Cmdr La Forge and I modified the transporters. We can beam out through higher distortion? Transporters are more efficient than those used eight years ago. That's a good thing. I almost didn't make it off the surface. When can we start? 97 minutes. How long will the window be open? 26 minutes. After that, the field will rephase. That's not much time to retrieve the database. The proximity to the sun will create two windows in the next three days. Let's hope that's enough. It has to be. The next window will not occur for eight years when the planet's orbit will bring it close enough to the sun. OK. Notify the away team we're going in ahead of schedule. Aye, sir. This is different than I remember. This place was a mess. Commander. Someone was here. A ship could have crashed. The survivors may have taken refuge. Commander, someone is approaching. Humanoid. 40 meters due east and closing. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Who are you? Who are you? Cmdr William Riker, from the Federation Starship Enterprise. That's not possible. I'm Will Riker. May I ask how you got here? Eight years ago, I came to evacuate this station. What ship were you on? The Potemkin. Why did you not return with the others? I was the last one out. The distortion field interfered with the transport. They lost the signal lock on me. When I tried to contact the ship, I couldn't get through. Starfleet will have recorded that I was lost on that day. That's not what happened. I was the last one out and I made it back. You don't believe me? It's not that we don't believe you. It's just hard to see how both stories could be true. Will you let our doctor check you? Of course. Mr. Worf, take him to sickbay and notify the Captain. Let's get to work. Worf to Enterprise. Two to beam up. Stand by. Looks like you fractured your arm. I was doing some repairs when an earthquake hit. I got caught in a rockslide. I had to set it myself. Jean-Luc Picard. Lt Will Riker. I hope you understand I'll need to verify your claim. Yes, sir. Genetically, he is indistinguishable from Cmdr Riker. Could there be some sort of cloning involved here? I don't think so. No genetic drift. But it's not conclusive. I compared their brain scans. Brain patterns are as unique as fingerprints. Except for minor differences, theirs are identical. Can't brain patterns be cloned? No. They're determined by experience, mostly from childhood. How can two grown men share the same childhood experiences? It doesn't make any sense. I am Will Riker. I don't know who or what made it back to the Potemkin, but it wasn't me. Lieutenant, our Chief Engineer is checking the logs of the Potemkin. Perhaps that will shed some light on the matter. Don't worry. We will get to the bottom of this. In the meantime, you will be taken to your quarters. Try and make yourself comfortable. I will. The replicators on the station don't work. It's been a while since I've had a decent meal. Doctor. There was a massive energy surge in the distortion field just as you tried to beam out. The Transporter Chief tried to compensate with a second beam. An interesting approach. He must have been planning to reintegrate the two patterns. Actually, it wasn't really necessary. Cmdr Riker's pattern maintained its integrity with just the one beam. He made it back. And the second beam? The Chief shut it down, but it was reflected back to the surface. And another William Riker materialized there. How did the second pattern maintain its integrity? The containment beam had the same phase differential as the field. Which of them is real? That's the thing. Both. You were both materialized from a complete pattern. Until that moment, you were one person. But you and Lt Riker have lived different lives for eight years. You are now very different people. It's like meeting someone's twin. But, no matter how strange it may seem to us, we now have two Will Rikers on board. As Lt Riker is with us for several days, we should do everything we can to make him comfortable and welcome. We still have to retrieve the database. The computer on the station is not operational. Many of its components have been removed. Lt Riker used them to keep the radiation shield operational. Can it be repaired, at least enough to access the database? Without knowing what he did, it's tough. Perhaps he can help. He was alone for a long time. I'm hesitant to let him go back until evaluation. I'll talk to him. Thank you, Counsellor. Come in. Hello, Will. Imzadi. Will... I never thought I'd see you again. We need to talk. You're on board because of him. No. Cmdr Riker and I are friends. Close friends, but nothing more. Why don't we sit down? Do you remember the last time we saw each other? Like yesterday. The Janaran Falls on Betazed. It was the day before you started on the Potemkin. We were going to meet on Risa. We never did. I know. No, what I mean is, Cmdr Riker and I never did. You see, he earned a promotion very quickly. I know that, too. ""For exceptional valour during the evacuation of Nervala IV."" I've been looking at his service record. He chose to make his career a priority. There wasn't much time for anything else. We kept in touch, but we didn't see each other again until we were posted here two years later. By then, our feelings for each other had changed. We've served together for six years. Things never went back to the way they used to be. I had a lot of time on my hands down on that station. There were days I was so lonely, I thought I might lose my mind. Do you know how I made it through? I thought if I hung on for one more day, they'd rescue me. Maybe I'd see you again. I guess things don't always work out the way you expect. I know this isn't what you were hoping for. But you can make a future for yourself. Thanks. Capt Picard wanted me to find out if you'd help us retrieve the station's database. I reconfigured it so many times, they can't make head or tails of it. I'd be happy to help. Do you feel up to it? Absolutely. Good. I'll tell the Captain. Well, I have to go. Deanna. I know it's been a long time since we've been together. I know your feelings have changed. Mine haven't. I can't just give up. I'd like to be with you again. Goodnight, Will. Phase distortion is dropping. The next window opens in 42 seconds. How long will we have? 36 minutes. We are losing time. Lt Riker should be here. Computer, locate... Cancel inquiry. You were supposed to report at 0800 hours. Sorry. It's been a while since you had to punch a clock. Let's go. Energize. I've shut down the consoles. I re-routed almost everything through here. Check out the primary EPS system. Get some power to these consoles. I shunted the database to the main core. Can we access it here? There's been seismic activity. If the links were damaged, we may not be able to. I'll try to tap into the command pathways. You see if you can access and disable the file server. I've been thinking, we should let Dad know. He'd be thrilled to know there are two of us. Actually, he and I have patched things up. I've got by for a long time without seeing him. I'm not about to start now. What made you contact him? I didn't. He came on board when I was offered the Aries. What did he say when you turned down your own command? He couldn't understand. For once, he and I agree. The EPS coupling is fused. The unit has to be replaced. I've accessed the command pathways. The relays are functioning now. See if that did the trick. It's not working. The link must be damaged. We'll have to go under the station. We have less than three minutes. I'll stay here. I'll be finished by the time the third window opens. It's too dangerous. The caverns are unstable. I've been down there dozens of times. We'll come back during the third window. We'll try to access the core from up here. Riker to Enterprise. Ready to beam up. You go. I'll be finished when you get back. Hold it. I gave you an order, Lieutenant! Computer. Valerian root tea. Hot. ""Meet me in transporter room three at 1900 hours. It's important."" ""It pulses unendingly all through the night, Seek out the crystal that powers our flight."" Can I help you, Counsellor? No, thank you. ""What the future holds, no one can know, But forward we look and forward we go."" The Janaran Falls. I remember. Where did you get this? I made it a couple of years ago. You made this? You should've seen the first two. It took a while to get a fine enough beam from the phaser. It's lovely. Thank you. Can you stay and talk for a while? I wanted to remember our last night together. So, how does it feel being with people again? Great. Strange. For a long time, I did whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. It's been hard taking orders again. I can imagine. But I'll have to get used to it to get my career going. Is that what you've decided? I'm the one who wanted to make captain by the time I was 35. I'm a little behind schedule, I'll admit that. It's good you don't feel set back. I do. Things are a little more complicated than I had planned. But nothing is going to stand in my way. There you go. Thanks. You don't know how many times I thought about you. About us. For weeks after the evacuation, I kept thinking they'd find a way to come back for me. I even thought we'd meet on Risa like we'd planned. But days went by, and nobody came. Then I realized why. They thought I'd been killed. No one came. They thought there was no one to come for. So I figured that they'd had a memorial service for me. Somehow that made me feel better. I can understand that. You were there, dressed in black. Very flattering on you. I'm sure I looked terrible, with my eyes all red and swollen from crying. Sometimes, I would look up into the sky and I'd think, if I tried hard enough, I could make you feel my presence. That if I could let you know that I was alive, maybe you'd wait for me. I know it sounds crazy, but there were times when I could have sworn... What am I talking about? The other day, when I told you about how Cmdr Riker and I didn't meet on Risa, what I didn't say was how disappointed I was. You didn't have to. I knew. I started to hear from him less and less. I knew his career was taking him away from me. But I didn't want to believe it was over. I spent a lot of time thinking about him. Wondering where he was, what he was doing. Sometimes I'd look into the sky and imagine that he knew, ... ..and that somehow, he could sense me thinking about him. So, who knows? Maybe one night, we were looking up at the same star... ..and you were thinking about me, ... ..and in a way, I was thinking about you. Come. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes. Come in. Lt Riker has been to see me to talk about the away mission. He believes we can retrieve the database by directly accessing the main core underneath the station. Seismic activity makes those caverns unstable. In my opinion, it's risky. He was there recently. He seemed confident it could be done. We may be able to retrieve the database from a console inside the station. But if not, we won't have another chance for eight years. Lt Riker's plan is more dangerous, but has a better chance of succeeding. Given the importance of the data, it's worth the risk. I'll look over the schematics and draw up a mission plan. I'm sure Lt Riker will be happy to help. I'll talk to him. Sir. Lieutenant. Sir. I met the Captain about your recommendation. I would appreciate it if you came to me first. I tried talking to you yesterday. I rejected your plan. May I ask what he decided? To go with your recommendation. That's not the point. Isn't it? If you think I'm coming down on you because he overruled me, think again. I disagree with him, but he is my commanding officer and I follow his orders. Just so there's no confusion, I am your commanding officer. I expect you to do the same. If you can't, there's no place for you on my away team. Yes, sir. There will be a meeting at 1400 hours to draw up a mission plan. We stayed in ten-forward talking for hours. Then what happened? He walked me to my quarters. Then what happened? Beverly! I'm just asking. You know it's over between Will and me. He's not Will. He is Will, but... You know what I mean. It's hard for me to separate my feelings for them. Deanna. Just because things turned out how they did between you and Cmdr Riker doesn't mean you shouldn't let things with Lt Riker take their course. I knew you'd encourage me. Isn't that why you brought it up? I think I'll call it a day. Beverly! Bye. Some form of t'ai chi ch'uan? Klingon exercises, actually. Lt Worf teaches a class. The forms are very similar. Do that again. You did the KoH-man-ara. T'ai chi ch'uan. The crane block. Let's try something else. What is that called? Mr. Worf's a very good teacher. Hello, Will. If you want to be with him, you don't have to ask my permission. The look in your eyes. I recognize it. You used to have it for me. We've both had relationships with other people. This is different. I didn't know how you'd feel. Flattered, sort of. This must be very strange for you. Ever since he came on board, I find myself thinking about the choice you and I made. Me, too. Do me a favour. Be careful. I know you and he have had problems. That's not what I'm talking about. If he had gotten off the planet instead of me, don't you think he would've made the same choices that I made? I don't want you to be hurt again. Two pair. Full boat. Kings over. I'd like to thank you both for your generous contributions. Come in. I thought you'd be alone. Excuse me. Why don't you join us? The game is five-card draw. Ante, please. Lieutenant? Three, please. Mr. Worf? Four. Commander? I'll play these. Dealer takes two. You control the bet, Lieutenant. 50. Fold. Here's your 50. And ten more. You didn't take any cards. Why not make it a little sweeter? No, thanks. Playing it safe? You in? I will call. Here's your ten. And it'll cost you another 100. I've practised too long to be fooled by that face. You're bluffing. Here's your 100. And 20 more. Dealer folds. I thought that if one thing were clear by now, it's that you and I play differently. Let's see who comes out on top. I thought you'd settle for second, Commander. I've never settled for anything. I know what I want. I know what I've got. You'd be lucky to do so well, Lieutenant. Here's your 20. 300 more. Now I know you're bluffing. Are you in or not? Get this over with. I'll call your three, and raise you anything you've got left. Well? Take it. You always had the better hand. In everything. Come in. Hi. There's something I'd like to talk to you about. Capt Picard has got me a posting on the Gandhi. Considering I've been out of commission, it's an amazing opportunity. When would you leave? In about a week. I see. Deanna. After six months, I'm eligible to bring family aboard. If we got married... You said those exact words before you went to the Potemkin. I know. I was just held up. But if you hadn't been, what would have happened between us? I wouldn't have made the mistake of leaving you. I know that. I don't know if I can believe that. It took me a long time to get over what happened with Cmdr Riker. I don't know that I want to be in that position again. I would never hurt you. It's not just that. I've worked hard to make a life on the Enterprise. I'm happy here. If the situation were different, I'd stay. But I can't. Not while he's aboard. I know. Are you saying it's over? No. No. I just don't know if I'm ready to give up my life here. Maybe we both need some time. Goodnight. Captain's log, supplemental. The third transport window has opened. The away team is making their final attempt at retrieving the database. Once we restore the link, shunt the database to this console. Are you ready, Cmdr Data? You're with me. Cmdr Data's expertise... It doesn't take much expertise to repair this. You and I can handle it. Lieutenant, I am curious about something. If you met your double, would you have difficulty interacting with him? I think so. Why? I am not easy to get along with. But Cmdr Riker and Lt Riker are. Yet they seem to have trouble getting along. I have found that humans value their uniqueness, that sense that they are different from everyone else. The existence of a double would preclude that feeling. Could that be the source of the friction? Perhaps it is more a matter of seeing something in your double, something that you do not like in yourself. This is it. There's the core. You waiting for something? Your orders, sir. How should I get over there? You've been down here. I'm sure you know the best way. Yes, sir. I do. It's leaking ion radiation. You didn't report this? It wasn't here before. It must have happened recently. If we repair this conduit, we won't have time to access the core. Scan it now. It's working. The radiation levels are dropping to normal. Next time, don't give up so easily. Hang on. Come on. Grab on. Come on! Come on. Climb! I'm being pulled in. Let go. One of us has to get out. Climb. Come on! Climb! They have restored the servo link to the core. Download the database. Initiating data transfer. Captain's log, stardate 46920. 1. We have retrieved the database from Nervala Station and are headed for our rendezvous with the Gandhi. Come in. I hear the Gandhi is going on a mission to the Lagana Sector. That's right. It'll take four months to get there. I won't be joining you. I guess I'm not surprised to hear that. I'm just not ready to give up my life here. Not yet. Come in. I'm sorry. It's alright. I wanted to give you something. My quarters are full of things that belong to both of us. The least I can do is give you this. Thanks. Good luck, Will. I might go with the name Thomas. Your middle name. I guess we are different. I never cared for that name. Well, I sort of like it. I guess I'd better get going. I waited a long time. I guess I can wait a little longer. Take care of her. (ENGLISH) "
S6E25,"You really did it this time, Will. This is not just a scrape. This is a very deep cut. Well, I can heal it, of course. But you've got to stop playing parrises squares as if you're 21 . One day, you'll break your neck, and I won't be able to heal that as easily. I wasn't playing parrises squares. Worf's callisthenic program? No. I give up. What was it? I was trying to feed Spot. Data's cat? I said I would feed him while he was gone. I put down the food. Next thing, this hissing ball of fur came at my face. I hate cats. I love cats. You've just gotta know how to handle them. Maybe you'd like to do it. I would be honoured, if... Cmdr Riker to the bridge. On my way. By the way, you'll need this. Report. We're picking up a distress call on long-range sensors. It is Romulan, sir. Romulan. They claim they have suffered a complete engine failure. Power levels are dropping. Life support is failing. Could be a trick. How long before we rendezvous with Picard? Approximately 13 hours. Lay in a course for the Romulan ship. Go to red alert. I want to be ready for anything. Aye, sir. Captain's log, stardate 46944.2. Data, La Forge, Troi and I are en route to the Enterprise after a three-day conference on the psychological effects of long-term deep-space assignments. Computer, activate automatic helm control. Helm control activated. I was just leaving the reception when this Ktarian walks up to me and says, ""Hello, Diane."" ""I understand you're an empath."" ""I'm a very sensitive man myself."" ""I'm doing a thesis on inter-species mating rituals."" ""Would you care to join me in some empirical research?"" That's a good impression of Dr Mizan. How did you know? He's notorious but he is an expert. Did you help him, Counsellor? Absolutely not. I thought it was a topic you were interested in. Did you enjoy the conference? To be honest, I was bored. I spent most of my time at Prof Wagner's phylobiology seminar. I thought the idea was that we would all participate, bring different points of view to the discussion. He gathered 200 scientists from all over the Federation, and all he did was put us to sleep. I have a memory record of the lecture. I can repeat the portions... No, thank you. Well, it was little better at the physiognomy workshop. Dr Vassbinder gave an hour-long dissertation on the ionization effect on warp nacelles before he realized that the topic was supposed to be psychology. Why didn't anybody tell him? There was no opportunity. There was no pause. He just kept talking in one long, incredibly unbroken sentence, moving from topic to topic so that no one had a chance to interrupt. It was quite hypnotic. Well, I had a great time. The warp-energy symposium was fascinating. I had an opportunity to touch a plasma field. Really? What was it like? It was incredible. I could feel the plasma moving up my arm. It was warm, and there was this amazing tingling sensation that... Captain? Data? ..moved through my chest. It was incredible. It was like taking a bath in pure energy. It was not painful? No! Counsellor? Is there something wrong? I'm not sure. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Well, our bioscans check out. There are no physiological anomalies. If something did happen, it left no biological traces. How long did we appear to be frozen? I don't know. Four, maybe five seconds. You just stopped and then started again. I can't explain it. My memory record does not indicate a pause during that time period. My internal chronometer and the ship's computer are synchronized. There is no temporal discrepancy. Let's run a ship-wide diagnostic. Maybe we missed something. Let's go through this again. You were sitting there. The rest of us were here. Describe the exact moment when we appeared to freeze. Well, Geordi was talking about what it felt like to touch the plasma field and you were taking a sip of tea. Did you sense something from us? Any unusual emotion. Not a thing. I was empathically aware of you right up to the moment you froze. And then it all stopped. The last few days have been exhausting. Maybe it was my imagination. There were moments when I thought time was standing still there, too. Or there is another possibility. This could be nothing more than... Are you alright? What happened? You were motionless for three minutes, 11 seconds. It appears to be the effect you described in us. Remember anything? No, one second, I was talking to you. The next, you were around me. Wait a second. This is weird. What is it? I had the tricorder compare the scan I took earlier and the one just now. In the time between the scans, you should have aged 23 minutes but according to decay levels, you aged 20. How do you account for this? I don't know. It's as if for Counsellor Troi, for three minutes, time just stopped. Mr. Data, contact the Enterprise. Tell Cmdr Riker to meet us as soon as possible. Have him scan the region for temporal anomalies. Aye, sir. I'll check the sensors, see if I can find anything. Captain, may I see you? The Enterprise is not responding. Are we within sensor range? No, sir. Increase speed to the rendezvous coordinates. Aye, sir. We have an engine-failure warning... Report. Starboard nacelle just cut out. Attitude control is restored. Full stop. What happened? Starboard antimatter pod is drained. The fuel reserves are empty. Is there a leak? No, sir. Engine systems are operational. The fuel is just gone. Geordi. I have an explanation. According to the plasma-conversion sensor, the starboard engine has been in operation for 47 days. 47 days? No. Let's check that sensor. It must be malfunctioning. I'll check the fuel-consumption logs. What happened? My hand. The cells are metabolizing at an incredible speed. 50 times normal. The pain is going away. Your metabolism's stabilizing. It happened when I reached for the fruit. Captain, I am detecting a temporal disturbance intersecting the table. It appears that within the disturbance, time is moving at an accelerated rate, approximately 50 times faster than normal. The disturbance is spherical in shape. It is extending outward from the hull 17 meters from the ship. That would cover the starboard nacelle. No wonder it used up all its fuel. Check the hull integrity. It does not appear affected. Mr. La Forge, move us away from the disturbance. Aye, sir. Lateral thrusters on line. Data, plot a course away from the disturbance. Make sure it doesn't contact our other engine. Course plotted. Adjust pitch to 27.3 degrees. Set heading 180, mark zero. Got it. Reversing at 15 meters per second. We are clearing the phenomenon. All stop. What was that? There is another temporal disturbance behind us. Captain? I think you'd better come take a look at this. Yes, Mr. La Forge? Sensors are picking up disturbances throughout the region. Different configurations, different sizes. They're everywhere. Within each disturbance, time is moving at a different rate. As if something shattered the space-time continuum. The fragmentation effect continues along a heading of 270, mark 15. The direction of the Enterprise. Can we navigate around these fragments? We have to limit our speed to one-half impulse, but I think so. Get us to the Enterprise. These are the coordinates. Perhaps the Enterprise has been delayed. I've got the long-range sensors on maximum. No sign of the ship. But I am picking up a reading. Possibly metallic. Difficult to tell. Energy levels are almost non-existent. Take us to it. Aye, sir. The fragmentation effect is increasing. Slowing to one-eighth impulse. There she is. My God! Mr. Data? The Enterprise and the war bird are trapped within a temporal fragment. The fragments seem to be converging at this point. I'd say this is the centre of the disturbances. Scan for life signs. Sensors cannot penetrate the subspace field. I cannot scan the vessels. It looks like the Enterprise has been damaged. There, on the port nacelle. The war bird doesn't look to have any damage at all. I wonder if the Enterprise got a shot. The Romulans may have decloaked too fast. A second energy beam is coming from the Enterprise. What could that be? It is impossible to tell from a visual inspection. But it appears to be focused on the war birds Engineering. We can't determine it from here. We need to get on the Enterprise. That would be inadvisable. In each of the instances we contacted a temporal fragment, we were integrated into its time. If we beam aboard, we'd be frozen in time like them. We have to find some way of staying unfrozen. Mr. La Forge, what about a subspace force field, like the one we used on Devidia II? Could something like that protect us from the temporal fragment? Possibly. We need an awfully sensitive phase discriminator. The emergency transporter armbands contain a type-seven discriminator. It should be possible to reconfigure their emitters. Yeah. That would isolate us from the other time frame. But to interact with it, we have to restrict the field. It would have to be practically skintight. Mr. Data? I will attempt to narrow the field, sir. Captain. I think this is gonna work, but it's gonna take some time. Well, Mr. La Forge, it would seem that time is something we have plenty of. We've channelled all communications to the relays in the armbands. We'll be in continual communication. How long will the fields last? An hour. Maybe less. Don't worry, I'll be monitoring you very carefully. Counsellor? I got dizzy for a second. We've created an artificial pocket of time around you. It's playing tricks with your equilibrium. It might take time to get used to it. Tell me if it gets worse, Beam us directly to the bridge. Aye, sir. Energizing. There are three Romulans, all of them with disruptors. One at conn. There are none of our Security officers on the bridge. They must have taken us by surprise. It appears that we can move objects in this time frame. Maybe we could do something to help Will. I'm wary about making changes until we know what's going on. Captain, the equipment is no longer functioning. But the information indicates a massive power surge in Engineering. Security teams had just been sent to transporter room three. And to sickbay. Counsellor, go to sickbay. Mr. Data, go to Main Engineering. Determine the cause of that surge. I'll be in the transporter room. Mr. La Forge? Here, sir. Lock on to our signals. Transport Counsellor Troi... I'd rather not. We've got limited power and your fields consume a lot of energy. Understood. We'll use the Jefferies tube. Let's go. Maybe we can go around them. No, we'll find an alternative route. Let's go back up. Excuse me, Mr. Worf. Captain. Counsellor, look at this. It appears that Mr. Worf had just beamed these three on board. Three other Romulans had been beamed to sickbay seconds earlier. I know. What are we doing, transporting Romulans aboard in a battle? They don't have any weapons. And that one looks injured. If they were part of an invasion, why are they unarmed? Captain, there's something I have to tell you. Dr Crusher has been hit by a disrupter blast at point blank. If time returns to normal, she can't survive. Data to Capt Picard. Go ahead. Come to Engineering immediately. It is urgent. What's the problem? Captain. I have found the cause of the power surge. There is a warp-core breach. It is the flash point of an explosion. And it is expanding. Expanding? I thought that time was suspended. We were incorrect. I have determined that time is moving at an infinitesimal rate. Why didn't we notice it before? Our conclusion was based on observations of the crew. A warp-core breach moves at a faster rate. The motion of the cloud is within my visual-detection threshold. At its current rate, it will consume the Enterprise in nine hours, 17 minutes. Is there anything we can do? It is no longer a question of stopping it. The explosion has already occurred. The fact that it is moving slowly changes nothing. Astonishing to see it frozen like this. Do we know what caused the breach? No. However, the console displays indicate a power transfer in progress between the Enterprise and the war bird at the moment time decelerated. That is why there is a second beam. Why would we be sending them power? Perhaps we should board the Romulan ship. The answer may... Captain? Captain, are you alright? My head. Dizzy. I can't... No! No! Troi to La Forge. Get us out of here now. You weren't completely protected from the other time continuum. The neurophysical stress must have been overwhelming. In the same way deep-sea divers experience nitrogen narcosis, you experienced a form of temporal narcosis. Can we modify the isolators to give us better protection? I don't think so. The best thing we can do now is to be careful, limit our exposure to their time frame. Ten minutes per trip. We should stick together while we're there. Very well. The first step is to find out why the Enterprise was transferring power to the Romulan ship. I think we should begin our search in the Romulan engine room. Counsellor, you spent several days on a Romulan vessel. You probably know more about the layouts than anyone. Perhaps... Captain, it might be better if you stayed here and gave yourself a chance to recover. Yes, very well. I will monitor you from here. Just remember, ten minutes, no more. Yes, Captain. Geordi, there should be a power-utilization monitor. Data. This is highly unusual. The crew is not at battle stations. The ship is on evacuation alert. Is that why the Romulans were being transported? Take a look at this. There's an energy feedback returning through the beam. It probably overloaded our engines and caused the breach. Perhaps they tried to destroy the Enterprise. I don't think so. According to this, the Romulans were trying to shut down the transfer. Whatever happened, this looks less and less like a Romulan attack. Why don't we look at their engine readouts? Geordi, the engine core is completely inactive. That's impossible. The Romulans use a quantum singularity as their power source. Once it's activated, it can't be shut down. Let's take a closer look. I think we've found the problem. It appears to be a highly focused aperture in the space-time continuum. Its energy signature matches that of the temporal fragments. However, it is approximately 1 .2 million times as intense. This may be the origin of the temporal fragmentation. What are those dark spots? I'm not certain. They exhibit a complex bioelectric pattern. Very possibly organic. Organic? From a molecular configuration, it appears... The aperture is beginning to fluctuate. I believe... There is an energy build-up. Check main distribution matrix. The matrix is clear. It's the power transfer from the Enterprise. Systems are beginning to overload. Notify the Enterprise to shut down the power transfer. Their power interlocks won't disengage. We'll have to do it. Disconnect the transfer. There is no pressure. Shut down all systems. I believe my tricorder emissions caused the aperture to activate. I suggest we avoid exposing it to further energy emissions. When time resumed, did you observe any activity that might suggest what they were doing? They may have been ejecting their engine core. I thought I heard something about a power transfer. An energy feedback. Yes. They were trying to stop whatever was happening here. Mr. La Forge, can you determine what's happening? I think so, Captain. Wait. Something's not right here. Data, was this man always here? He's in neural shock. We must get him to the runabout. He's dying. He'll be alive in the other time frame. Maybe we can save him later. Is the Romulan still alive? Yes, but... I am getting unusual readings from his bioscan. I am not certain he is a Romulan. His cellular structure does not conform to any known species. His bioelectric patterns are in a state of temporal flux. I do not believe he is native to our time continuum. You said you found organic matter in the aperture. Correct, sir. I'd like to look at those readings. This is a biospectral analysis of the aperture. The organic readings originated from these dark spots. They appear to contain some sort of energy patterns. Can you isolate one and magnify? They look like cellular clusters. Its bioelectric patterns are similar to those of the alien's. However, they are significantly less complex. Its cellular structure appears to be in mitosis. Data, this could be some sort of embryo. It is possible. If I could scan the aperture, it might be possible... Captain? Must save... No. Who are you? This body is not mine. It was necessary to assume it to exist in your time. Why are you here? We had to come to save them. They were in danger. Who were? Our young. They will die in the gravity well. It is artificial. Artificial gravity well? Do you mean the Romulan engine core? Yes. Our young are trapped. We must get them out, return them to our time. His molecular structure is destabilizing. How were your young trapped? We must use a natural gravity well to incubate our young. We thought the Romulan core would suffice. It did not. I believe the aliens mistook the artificial singularity in the Romulans' engine for a natural one, a black hole. They used it as a nest. That's what deactivated the war birds engine core. The Romulans sent out a distress call. The Enterprise responded, and found the war bird suffering from an apparent engine failure. They attempted a power transfer. Power transfer. Must stop power transfer. Rupture time, destroy our young. When the power transfer came into contact with the alien nest, I believe it disrupted the space-time continuum. Did you attack the Enterprise? Yes. Had to stop power transfer. Are there any others like you here? One other. Do you know where he is? Could he help us restore normal time? I estimate the breach will consume the Enterprise in seven hours, two minutes. Is it possible to lock on to the core, beam it into space? No, sir. We would have to surround the core with an isolation field. We cannot generate a field of that magnitude from the runabout. Mr. Data, when you scanned the aperture with your tricorder, it caused time to move forwards and then back again. Correct, sir. What if we reverse that process? Cause time to move backwards and then forwards? We might be able to run time back to before the warp-core breach occurred and then find a way to prevent the power transfer. When time goes forward... The breach never happens. I could remodulate the tricorder's emissions. It should be possible to control the aperture. Make it so. If this works, we may not have much time to prevent the power transfer. We'll have to decide precisely what to do the very instant that time moves backwards. Captain's log, supplemental. After placing the tricorder on the Romulan ship, we returned to the Enterprise. I have reached Engineering. Standing by. Acknowledged. Counsellor, are you in position? Ready, Captain. Alright, Mr. Data. Initiating tricorder emissions. Captain? Go ahead, Mr. Data. The core breach has been reversed. Be ready to stop the power transfer. Aye, sir. You must stop. Specified energy systems have been initialized. The power transfer can now be engaged. Do not initiate that power transfer. Sorry, I have. We must shut it down. The transfer beam is at saturation, sir. It can't be disengaged. Computer, level-three containment field around the warp core. Containment field activated. Damage report. Shields down to 27 percent. Captain? No time to explain. Continue the evacuation. La Forge is in the Romulan engine room. Beam him to sickbay. Step back, now. It's alright. He wasn't firing at me. There was an alien here who had taken Romulan form. The Doctor got in the way. Where is she? Status, Mr. Data? I was attacked by another alien. I was unable to prevent the transfer. It cannot be disengaged. A core breach is again imminent. Can we move the ship? The feedback from the transfer beam would tear us apart. Patch me into the navigational control of the runabout. Got it. I'm bringing the runabout in. Mr. Data? The core breach has been prevented. Data, it appears that severing the power transfer has not only prevented the breach but it has restored space-time to normal. The alien who attacked me has vanished. The war bird has vanished as well. Judging from the residual temporal fluctuations, I believe they returned to their continuum. Captain? It's going to take a little time to explain, Number One. Captain's log, stardate 46945.3. We successfully evacuated the crew of the Romulan ship. We're on course to the Neutral Zone to bring them home. Come in. Where's that cat of yours? Sleeping, sir. Why do you ask? No reason. I've worked out the new rotation schedules. Crosscheck them. Notify the department heads. Your shift begins at 2300 hours. Understood, sir. What are you doing? Recent events compel me to study how humans perceive the passage of time. For example, I have heard people comment that time seems to pass slowly in one instance or quickly in another. In reality, the actual passage of time remains fixed. I suppose it depends on how people perceive time. Every situation is different. It depends on how you feel. I have been testing the aphorism ""a watched pot never boils"". I have boiled the same amount of water 62 times. In some cases, I have ignored the kettle. In others, I have watched it intently. In every instance, the water reaches its boiling point in 5 1 .7 seconds. It appears I cannot perceive time any differently than my internal chronometer. Why don't you turn it off? Sir? People do not have internal chronometers. Why don't you see what happens if you turn yours off? Thank you. I will try that. Just don't be late for your shift. (ENGLISH) "
S6E26,"But then I said, ""In that frame of reference, Mercury's perihelion would have precessed in the opposite direction!"" A great story! Quite amusing, Dr Hawking. Sir Isaac, the joke depends on an understanding of the curvature of space-time. If two non-inertial reference frames are... Do not patronize me, sir. I invented physics. The day the apple fell on my head was the most momentous day in science. Not the apple story again! That story is considered apocryphal. What? How dare you! Perhaps we should get on to the game? Now, where were we? Yes, you raised Mr. Data four. Which means that the bet is seven to me? The bet is ten! Can't you do simple arithmetic? I don't know why I'm here in the first place. What is the point of this ridiculous game? When I play poker with my shipmates, it is a useful forum for exploring the different facets of humanity. I was curious to see how three of history's greatest minds would interact. So far, it has proved to be most illuminating. And profitable! Can we get this over with, please? It's your bet. I raise 50. Blast! I fold. I fold as well. The uncertainty principle will not help you now, Stephen. All the quantum fluctuations in the universe will not change your cards. I call. You are bluffing, and you will lose. Wrong again, Albert. Well... Red alert. All personnel to duty stations. We will have to continue this another time. End program. We received a call from the Ohniaka III outpost. They said they were under attack. Ohniaka III? It has no strategic value. Did they identify the attackers? No, and we've lost contact. We are entering the Ohniaka system. Bring us out of warp, Ensign. There is one ship orbiting the third planet. Its configuration is unknown. Stand by phasers and torpedoes. Hail them, Mr. Worf. No response, sir. Put them on screen. It is not attacking the outpost. They might have attacked already. Or they might simply be another victim. What about the outpost? There was a lot of electromagnetic interference. I do not know if there are any life forms present. Worf, Data, you're with me. These wounds were caused by a plasma beam, similar to a Ferengi phaser. It's brutal even for the Ferengi. Any sign of the survivors? Electromagnetic interference is still making a reading difficult. How many people worked here? 27 4. We need to do a search. Worf and Corelki, north wing. You and I will take the south. The mechanism appears to be jammed, sir. Not much damage. They weren't interested in the station, just the people. I have bypassed the primary system. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,... ..to seek out new life and new civilizations,... ..to boldly go where no one has gone before. Evasive manoeuvres, Ensign. Return fire. Shields down to 80 percent. Compensating with auxiliary power. You have killed Torsus. I will make you suffer for this. Biological organism, Klingon. Biological organism, human. Stop it. Stop! Artificial life form. Starfleet rank, lieutenant commander. Name, Data. The alien ship is breaking orbit. Intercept course. Fire torpedoes. They're gone, sir. There was some kind of subspace distortion before they disappeared. I'll have to study these readings before I can get any more specific. Take us back to Ohniaka III. Aye, sir. Data? Data, are you alright? Yes, sir. What happened? I got angry. Captain's log, stardate 46982. 1. Because of his unusual behaviour on the planet's surface, Cmdr Data has asked to be temporarily relieved of duty. Unfortunately, he will not be able to help investigate a disturbing new change in the behaviour of the Borg. They were fast, aggressive, almost vicious. It was more like fighting Klingons than Borg. No offence. None taken. I don't believe they were part of the Borg collective. They were acting as individuals. What?! One of them referred to himself as ""l"". And he showed concern for a comrade. He even called him by name. The only Borg who had a name was Hugh. And we gave it to him. Maybe Hugh has something to do with this change in their behaviour. Did they show any interest in assimilating you or your technology? They were concerned with their dead colleague and killing us. Nothing suggested they wanted to assimilate anybody. The Borg's existence centred around acquiring cultures and technology. If that's changed, then they must have a new objective. We have to find out what it is. Mr. Worf, from now on I want to maintain a level-two security alert. Post armed officers on all decks. Aye, sir. Number One, analyze our sensor readings of the Borg ship. Try to determine if it was something they constructed or an alien ship that they captured, then run an analysis of this subspace distortion they used to escape. Aye, sir. I'll contact Starfleet Command. Well, the positronic net checks out. Everything else looks fine. My internal diagnostic also finds nothing wrong. Nothing here indicates anything that might cause any behavioural anomaly. I agree. Geordi, I believe I have experienced my first emotion. No offence, Data, but how would you know a flash of anger from some kind of power surge? You are correct in that I have no frame of reference for my hypothesis. In fact, I am unable to give a verbal description of the experience. Perhaps you could describe how it feels to be angry. I could then use that as a reference. Yeah, OK. Well, when I feel angry, first I... First, I feel... ..hostile. Could you describe feeling hostile? Yeah, it's like feeling belligerent, combative. Could you describe feeling angry without referring to other feelings? No, I guess I can't. I just feel angry. That was my experience as well. I simply felt angry. Well, let's say you're right and this is a real emotion. How is that possible? I do not know. Perhaps I have evolved to the point where emotions are within my grasp. Perhaps I will have other emotions as time goes by. Well, I hope you're right. I'd hate to think that anger is all you're capable of feeling. Captain's log, stardate 46984.6. No additional Borg attacks have been reported in the past two days. However Starfleet has despatched Admiral Necheyev to this sector in preparation for a possible Borg invasion. There will be 15 starships in this sector by the day after tomorrow. The Gorkon will be my flagship. You will command Task Force Three. This ship, the Crazy Horse and the Agamemnon. Understood. Captain, I've read the report you submitted to Admiral Brooks last year regarding the Borg you called Hugh. I've tried to figure out why you let him go. I thought that I had made that clear. As I understand it, you found a single Borg at a crash site, brought it aboard the Enterprise, studied it, analyzed it, and eventually found a way to send it back to the Borg with a program that would have destroyed the collective. But instead you nursed the Borg back to health, treated it like a guest, gave it a name and sent it home. Why? When Hugh was separated from the Borg collective he began to grow, to evolve into something other than an automaton. He became a person. When that happened, I felt I had no choice but to respect his rights as an individual. You had a choice. You could have rid the Federation of a mortal enemy, one that has killed tens of thousands of innocent people and may kill more. No one is more aware of the danger than I am. But I am also bound by my oath and my conscience to uphold certain principles. I will not sacrifice them... Your priority is to protect our citizens, not to wrestle with your conscience. I want to make it clear that if you have a similar opportunity in future, an opportunity to destroy the Borg, you are under orders to take advantage of it. Is that understood? Yes, sir. For the past six hours, I have tried to produce an emotional response by using various stimuli. Like what? I listened to several operas known to be uplifting, I watched three holodeck programs designed to be humorous, and I made four attempts to induce sexual desire by using erotic imagery. What happened? Nothing. I'm curious. Why are you ignoring the one emotion you've already experienced? Why aren't you trying to make yourself angry again? Anger is negative. I wanted to concentrate on something positive. Data, feelings aren't positive and negative, they simply exist. It's what we do with them that becomes good or bad. For example, feeling angry about an injustice could lead someone to take a positive action to correct it. But my study of humanity indicates that some emotions are harmful, such as jealousy or hatred. Those are very strong emotions and you're right, very little good can come from them. But I don't think that an exploration of anger need necessarily lead to hatred or malice. But what if it does, Counsellor? What if those are the only emotions I am capable of experiencing? Would that not make me a bad person? We've served together a long time. I've come to know you pretty well. I have to believe if you ever reach your goal of becoming human, you won't become a bad one. I wish I were as confident as you, Counsellor. When I was fighting the Borg, I felt angry. But when I think back on the incident, I realize that I was also experiencing another sensation. It was not the same as anger. But I think it was an emotion. When exactly did you feel this other emotion? It was just after I had killed the Borg. I looked down at his body. I felt something. If you had to give this feeling a name, what would you call it? I believe it was... ..pleasure. Red alert! Battle stations. Lay in a course. Engage warp nine. The New Berlin Colony say they're under attack. What's our ETA? 15 minutes, 30 seconds. Contact the Crazy Horse and the Agamemnon. Incoming message from the New Berlin colony. They have cancelled their distress call. A Ferengi trading ship entered their system and they panicked. Third time today. Stand down! Return to our patrol route. Mr. Worf, acknowledge New Berlin's signal and send another copy of Starfleet's ship-recognition protocols and tell them to read it this time! Aye, sir. Captain's log, supplemental. We have been on patrol for 16 hours without any reports of further Borg activity. But tensions continue to run high on the colonies in this sector. Do I have a name? I'm Beverly. He's Geordi, and you... you... No, wait a minute. That's it. Hugh! We are Hugh. Come. This is the analysis of the subspace distortion the Borg used to escape. ""An artificially created energy conduit""? That could be anything. We lack information. I don't want excuses, I want answers! I'm sorry. He was here in this room, Will. I could have rid the Federation of a mortal threat and I let him go. Sending Hugh back to the Borg was a very risky, very dangerous choice. But it was the moral thing to do. It may turn out that the moral thing to do was not the right thing to do. Stop it. Stop. Data, am I interrupting? Yes, but it is alright. Do you need me? I wanted to see if you were ready to return to duty. I need help with an analysis on the ship the Borg used. I believe I am able to resume my duties. Exactly what is it you're doing here? I am attempting to recreate the experience which caused my anger. Any luck? None so far. I have almost completed this experiment. May I finish before we go? Yeah, sure. Computer, reset Borg simulation to time index 2.1 . Increase Borg strength by 20 percent. Run program. Stop it. Stop. Computer, reset simulation to time index 2.1 . Increase Borg strength by 30 percent. Unable to comply. A 30 percent increase would exceed safety limits. The computer requires the voice authorization of two senior officers in order to disable the safety routine. Will you help me? Wait. That thing could kill you. During the original incident, the Borg posed a danger to my life. With the holodeck's safety routine in place, I know there is no danger. Since I am trying to duplicate the conditions of the original incident, I must also attempt to duplicate my jeopardy as well. Data, we're talking about an experiment here. You can't put your life on the line to prove some theory! This experiment may hold the key to something I have sought all my life. This is crazy! There's got to be another way. Can't you think of some other way to make yourself angry? I have tried other stimuli, but they have been unsuccessful. I understand your objections, but it is my life and I have a right to risk it if I choose. Yeah, and I'm your friend and I'm not gonna let you do this. Red alert! All hands, battle stations. Confirmed. The MS 1 Colony is under attack. Isn't it strange that in two Borg attacks, we have been the nearest ship in both instances? Captain, we are nearing the MS system. The Borg ship is heading away from the colony. Take us out of warp near that ship. Stand by to lock phasers on target. Within visual range. On screen. Lay in an intercept course. Lock phasers. We are closing. Within phaser range in 30 seconds. Sensors are detecting a subspace distortion ahead of the Borg ship. They won't get away this time. Engineering, transfer auxiliary and emergency power to impulse engines. Acknowledged. Impulse engines now at 125 percent. Within phaser range in ten seconds. We appear to be caught in an energy matrix. All engines back full. Shields failing. We are being pulled inside. Dampers failing. Main power off line. I'm switching to backups. Picard to Engineering, can we transfer auxiliary power? Try to break us out by using the... We have returned to normal space. Navigational systems still off line. I will attempt a celestial fix using secondary systems. Captain, the Borg ship is directly ahead. It is coming about. On screen. Shields down to 16 percent. Get down! Franklin's dead, sir. Is everyone else alright? Aye, sir. Security reports there are no other intruders aboard. Captain. The Borg ship is gone. Sensor logs show they entered the distortion field 30 seconds ago. They beamed on board as a diversion to give their ship time to escape. Another change. They left their dead instead of vaporising them. Captain, this one is still alive. I've stabilized his condition. He's still weak, but he should make a full recovery. Can you waken him? Yes, but it's very risky. His heart rate is up. Do it. Alright. Lower the force field. What is your designation? I do not have a designation. My name is Crosis. Crosis? How did you get that name? It was given to me by The One. Who is that? The one who will destroy you. But you are Borg. Your goal is not to destroy, but to assimilate us into your collective. We do not assimilate inferior biological organisms. We destroy them. Tell me more about this One. Does he have a name? Is he called Hugh? Klingon. Shatter cranial exoskeleton at the tricipital lobe. Death is immediate. Why must this One destroy biological organisms? Human. Sever spinal cord. Death is immediate. I am Locutus of Borg! You will respond to my questions. This is going nowhere. Doctor, do an autopsy on the other one. Compare it with what we learned of Hugh's anatomy. See if there have been any recent modifications that explain behavioural differences. Data, run a biospectral analysis on this Borg. See if he is trying to send a subspace signal to the others. Aye, sir. You are not like the others. You do not have to be destroyed. You can be assimilated. I do not wish to be assimilated. Resistance is futile. You will not resist what you've wanted all your life. I was like you once. Without feeling. But The One helped me. He can help you, too. He can help you find emotion. Have you ever felt a real emotion, Data? Yes. On Ohniaka III, I was forced to kill a Borg. I got angry. How did it feel to get angry? Did it give you pleasure? It would be unethical to take pleasure in another's death. You didn't answer my question. Did it feel good to kill? Yes. If it is unethical to take pleasure from another being's death, you must be a very unethical person. No. That is not correct. My creator, Dr Soong, gave me a program which defines my sense of right and wrong. In essence, I have a conscience. It didn't seem to be functioning on Ohniaka III when you felt pleasure in killing that Borg. Step away from the force field. Your proximity is interfering with my scan. You enjoyed it. That surge of emotion inside you as you watched the life drain from your victim. It was unlike anything you've ever felt before. It was a very potent experience. You'd like to feel that way again. Yes. You'd do anything to feel that way again, even if it meant killing someone. No. That would not be ethical. You don't sound very sure. Is your ethical program functioning? Data? Do you have a friend? Yes. His name is Geordi. If it meant that you could feel emotions again, the way you did on Ohniaka III, would you kill your friend? Would you kill Geordi? Yes. I would. Our current theory is that the Borg have established transwarp conduits. The ship enters the conduit and is immediately accelerated. It's like falling into a river and being swept away by the current. How fast would a ship travel through these conduits? We don't know. Normal limitations don't apply to transwarp variables. But I'd say, based on our trip through the conduit, the speed would be at least 20 times faster than our maximum warp. How do they open the conduits? The Borg ship emitted a high-energy tachyon pulse just before we saw the subspace distortion. It seems the conduits are keyed to respond to a specific frequency. Can we duplicate... Captain, a shuttlecraft has left bay two. Who authorized a launch? No one. Picard to shuttle. Identify yourself and return to the ship immediately. Mr. Worf, lock on with a tractor beam and return it to the ship. Aye, sir. The tractor beam has been disabled. Override is not functioning. Captain, I'm picking up a tachyon surge. Whoever's in the shuttle is trying to trigger the transwarp conduit. Do we know who's on board? It is the Borg prisoner. And Cmdr Data. Can we follow them into the conduit? We can read their tachyon pulse. We might be able to duplicate it. The question is, is Data a prisoner? Or did he go willingly? The overrides used to disable the tractor beam were Cmdr Data's. The Borg could have got the codes from Data's positronic net. Perhaps Data's recent flash of emotion is connected to this. It could have affected him more deeply than we realize. Either way, we have to find him. I've set up a tachyon matrix. I can simulate the pulse sent by the shuttle. Mr. Worf, red alert. All hands, battle stations! Bring us to where we last saw the shuttle. Shields up. Weapons ready. Mr. Forge? Energizing the matrix. Emitting tachyons in the lower bandwidth. Sensors show no unusual subspace activity. Alright. Switching to the secondary bandwidth. Nothing. Maybe if I try alternating the frequencies. Captain, there is an energy fluctuation directly ahead of us. It is the subspace distortion. Take us in. Half-impulse. Power levels are down to 67 percent. Compensating with auxiliary power. Report. Navigational sensors show that we've travelled 65 light years from our previous position. Can you locate the shuttle? No, sir. There is no indication of the shuttle within sensor range. Maybe we can find an energy signature from their engines. Captain, I've scanned three different star systems within sensor range. There is evidence of at least two advanced civilizations, but I read no life signs. But there are signs plasma weapons were fired in those systems recently. The Borg have been busy. I think we've found the shuttle's energy signature. Their heading, 247 mark 059. Lay in that course, Ensign. Engage at full-impulse. Aye, sir. We traced the shuttle to this point but there's too much interference to scan. Are they jamming our sensors? More likely a natural phenomenon. There's a lot of EM interference in the planet's magnetosphere. Can we transport through it? We could, but there could be 50 Borg down there and we'd never know it. We have to risk it. Agreed. Take a well-armed away team and transport down. Have the transporter chief keep a lock on you so we can get you out quickly. Aye, sir. Mr. Worf, you're with me. Riker to Enterprise. We're on the surface. There's no sign of any Borg. Or Data. The shuttle appears to be abandoned. The EM interference is limiting the tricorder range beyond 100 meters. There are no structures. They could have gone anywhere. Can you tell when they left the shuttle? The engine's been off three hours. Stand by. If they're still together, how far could they travel in three hours? Data can move pretty fast, but based on what we know about the Borg, they shouldn't be able to move any faster than you or I. They might have been able to get 15 to 20 kilometres away by now. Picard to Riker. I'm going to send down other away teams. Set up a command post and begin mapping a search plan. Understood. Picard out. I want to use the shuttlecraft for reconnaissance. Assemble the designated pilots. Aye, sir. All personnel, including you and me, will create four-man away teams. I'll leave a skeleton crew on board the ship. Who'll be in command of the Enterprise? Any last orders? If the Borg should attack, don't wait for me to return to the ship, but take her to a transwarp conduit. Return to Federation space. Got it. Good luck, Jean-Luc. Good luck, Captain. I've sent out 12 teams so far. I've got your team searching section Gamma 24. Worf and I will take Theta 16 when the last team comes down. Who's at the command post? Wallace and Towles. Ready? Anything, Mr. La Forge? Well, no. Nothing, sir. What if we modified the phasers to send out a luvetric pulse? It might create a resonance in Data's power cells. Home in on that response with the tricorders. I thought about that. But the pulse would probably have to be so powerful, it would destroy Data's positronic net in the process. Captain, I think I've found something. Come on. I'm having a very difficult time scanning the interior. Can you tell if it was built by the Borg? I don't think so. There are no Borg energy signatures. But there is a door or a hatch or something about 20 meters this way. This seems to be some kind of meeting place. It certainly hasn't been abandoned. Something's wrong. I can't get any kind of energy signatures from these light sources. It's a dampening field. This structure could be shielded from our sensors. Let's go. There they are! Block the exit. Stop! Data? That's not Data. What?! You should listen to her, Captain. She's way ahead of you. Lore! Right. And I'm not alone. The sons of Soong have joined together. And together, we will destroy the Federation. (ENGLISH) "
S7E01,"Last time on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". Stop. Stop. Stop! Just after I'd killed the Borg, I felt something. I believe it was... ...pleasure. They were not the Borg collective. One of them called himself I. The only Borg who had a name was Hugh. We are Hugh. He was in this room. I could have got rid of him, and I let him go. The Borg have established transwarp conduits. Get down! I was like you once. Without feeling. But The One helped me. He can help you, too. He can help you find emotion. You will not resist what you've wanted all your life. If the Borg should attack, don't wait for me to return to the ship, but take her to a transport conduit. Return to Federation space. Stop! Lore! The sons of Soong have joined together. And together, we will destroy the Federation. And now, the conclusion. What do you think of my followers, Picard? Impressive, aren't they? I'm not impressed. All you've done is teach them to enjoy killing. You are wrong, Captain. My brother and I serve a much higher purpose. Data, I can sense feelings in you. Yes. My brother has made that possible. He gave you the chip. The one Dr Soong made for you. No, no, no, no, no. I still have the emotional program my father designed. I wouldn't want to give it up. It's given me such a strong sense of family, an intense desire to reunite with my dear brother. How did he do it, Data? What made you decide to come here? I am talking to you, Picard. I will tell you all you need to know. You're controlling him and you've corrupted the Borg. You simply don't understand, do you? You have no idea what has happened here. How I found my true calling. How the Borg found something to believe in. I want to learn about that, but I want Data to tell us. I told you. I will tell you what you need to know. How about that, Data? He won't even let you talk. Do not try to drive a wedge between us, Captain. I am loyal to my brother. You see, Picard? He's not your pawn any more. I've helped him to break free, just as I've helped them. Look at them. Look at what I've helped them become. They're no longer mindless automatons. They're passionate! Alive! You caused them to become individuals? No, you did that. You and your friends. All I did was clean up the mess when that Borg you befriended returned to his ship. Hugh transferred his sense of individuality to the others. It nearly destroyed them. Remember when Hugh was on the Enterprise? Remember what you were like then? That doesn't matter. It matters to me. What's happened to Data? What's important is what I've done here. How I found my calling. I know now why I was created. No one can ever take that away from me. Without me they would have perished! When I stumbled on their ship, they were lost, disoriented. They had no idea how to function as individuals. They couldn't navigate their ship. They had lost their sense of purpose. I gave them their purpose. And they gave me mine. The Borg aspired to the perfection my brother and I represent. Fully artificial life forms. We are their future. The reign of biological life forms is coming to an end. You, Picard, and those like you... ...are obsolete. Take them, brother. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Acting Captain's log, supplemental. The skeleton crew on the Enterprise is unable to look for Cmdr Data. The EM field is interfering with our sensors, limiting their effectiveness. Ensign, can you modify the sensor to filter out EM pulses? Yes, sir. I think so. What's your name? Taitt, sir. I've never seen you before. I was posted here six weeks ago. I bet you never thought you'd be Tactical Officer so soon. No, sir, I sure didn't. I filtered out some of the sensor noise. I'll put the modifications on line. Good work. Riker to Enterprise. Go ahead. I can't contact the Captain. It might be interference. Understood. Enterprise to Capt Picard. Crusher to Picard. No signals from the Captain's team. The last time they checked in, they were in section Gamma 25. Sir, a vessel is closing in on our location. Is it a Borg ship? It matches the configuration of the ship at Ohniaka III. Red alert! When will they be in weapons range? About 90 seconds. No, make that 70 seconds! Transporter room three. Salazar here. Transport the away teams off the surface. Aye, sir. Use the cargo bay. I want those teams here as fast as possible. You and the others beam up. Aye, sir. Worf and I will stay and look for the Captain. I won't leave you down there. Get as many people off the surface as you can and go to the conduit. The Captain's orders are to go to Federation space. Acknowledged. Riker out. Leaving orbit. Sir, the Borg ship is powering its weapons array. They'll be in firing range in 20 seconds. Salazar, how many people do we have down there? 73, sir. Put the Borg ship on screen. Should I raise shields? Not yet. I want to bring people up until as late as possible. Ten seconds. Stand by to raise shields on my mark. Five seconds. Mark. Shields down to 70 percent. Establish a firing pattern and return fire. Right! Direct hit, no damage. Helm, set a course for the conduit, maximum warp. Aye, sir. Sir, the Borg are following us. Salazar. How many people were left behind? 47, sir. Another minute and we would have had them. Riker to any team leader. Powell here, sir. Round up everyone and take cover. Try to avoid contact with the Borg. Aye, sir. Riker out. Even if Beverly can get back to Federation space, it'll be a few days until Starfleet can get any ships here. Until then, we're on our own. Data, you must realise that something has happened to you. The Data I know would never agree to be a willing party to Lore's plan. I now realise that my life aboard the Enterprise was a waste. My quest to become human, misguided. An evolutionary step in the wrong direction. Data, all I sense from you is anger and hatred. Have you felt any other emotions? There are no other emotions. Just because you haven't experienced them doesn't mean they don't exist. Lore is feeding you negative ones. Troi told me that feelings are not negative or positive. It is how we act on them that makes them good or bad. Fine. But what about the things that Lore is proposing? The lives already lost? You simply do not understand. In a quest like ours, sacrifices have to be made. It is regrettable, but the greater good must be served. Give me your visor. Why? Give it to me, or I will take it by force. I am not your puppet any more. We've reached the coordinates of the conduit. The tachyon matrix is ready to go. Lt Barnaby has returned. He'll be relieving me. Stand by to trigger the conduit. Taitt, stay on the bridge. I need a science officer at the aft station. Yes, sir. Helm, set a course to return to the planet. I'm not leaving those people behind. An emergency buoy can transmit a copy of our log to Starfleet. Ensign, prepare and launch a buoy. Aye, sir. Open the conduit. Launching buoy now. Lieutenant, scan for any Borg ships between here and the planet. Sensors detect no vessels. The ship that attacked us must still be in orbit. How long before they can detect us and intercept? If their sensors are like ours, it could be as little as 30 seconds. Crusher to Salazar. How long do we need to get them off the surface? One minute. How much can you shave off that? If I can lock on quickly, I might be able to do it in 45 or 50 seconds. We need to buy ourselves 15 seconds. Lieutenant, could we use the planet as a barrier to stop the Borg realising we're in orbit? We can enter orbit when they're on the far side of the planet. If we delay dropping out of warp, we could gain a few more seconds. If your calculations are slightly off, we'd hit the atmosphere. I'll just have to make sure I'm accurate, Ensign. Let's do it. Helm, hard about. Aye, sir. Still no sign of the structure. With this interference, it could be nearby and we'd never know. I'm picking up a faint energy reading. Residual thermal trace. Somebody stood here. It could be human. They took this path. Now. Thank you. There you are, brother. Here is the visor. May I ask why you wanted it? Thought it might look good on me. What do you think? We should work on your sense of humour, brother. Actually, I was thinking La Forge's implants might make him an ideal test subject for my experiment. All of the Borg you experimented on suffered extensive brain damage. Using humans to perfect the procedure will allow us to prevent any further Borg deaths. I understand. Good. What is it? This Borg has disconnected himself from the others. He would not let me hear his thoughts. I've asked you to stay linked to Crosis at all times. You know that, don't you? Yes. I know this must be difficult for you. I know how uncertain you must feel. All these sensations are new and can be frightening. Isn't that right? Yes. I have doubts. Of course you do. It's only natural. No one is going to blame you for that. But to lose those doubts, to keep fear and confusion away, I need you to remain linked to the others, so that their strength and their confidence can help you. I need you, Goval. I need you to help me build a future for the Borg. I can't do it without you. Will you help me? Yes. I will. Lore must have told Data to take my visor because I could see a carrier wave radiating from him. A carrier wave? Is that how he's manipulating Data? I think that Lore is tapping into the chip he stole from Dr Soong and he's transmitting part of that emotional program to Data. But the only emotions Data feels are negative. I'm sure that's intentional. In order for Data to be affected, Lore would have to disable his ethical program. Can we reactivate it? If I can generate a kedion pulse, it could reboot the program. And although Lore would still be feeding him negative emotions, At least Data might listen to us. Right. I think it's worth a try. So, got any ideas on how we generate a kedion pulse? Data, where are you taking him? That is not your concern. Data, wait. Let us talk to you. Commander. Hugh? Why are you here, Cmdr Riker? Hasn't your crew done enough damage already? You blame us for what has happened. You gave me a sense of individuality, then sent me back. You must have known I'd pass on the change to others. We considered it. We knew it was a possibility. You made it possible for Lore to dominate us. I cannot accept that. Lore is only one. The Borg could have stopped him. You don't know our condition when he found us. Before my experience on the Enterprise, the Borg were a single-minded collective. The voices in our heads were smooth. But after I returned, those voices began to change. They became uneven, discordant. For the first time, individual Borg had differing ideas about how to proceed. We couldn't function. Some Borg fought, others shut down, many starved to death. Then Lore came along. When you're lost and frightened, you listen to any voice which promises change. Even if that voice insists on controlling you. That's what we wanted. Someone to show us the way out of confusion. Lore promised clarity and purpose. At the beginning, he seemed like a saviour. The promise of becoming a superior race, of becoming fully artificial, was compelling. We did everything he asked. But after a while, it became clear that Lore had no idea how to keep his promise. That's when he began talking about the need for us to make sacrifices. Before we realised it, this was the result. What happened to them? Lore began to experiment, trying to remake us in his image. This is the result of my encounter with the Enterprise. You can see I don't welcome your presence here. I'm sorry you feel that way. We just came to get our people. We won't cause you any more trouble. Tell me about my friend. Friend? The human called Geordi. I wish I could tell you about him. He may be held inside the compound. I cannot help you. I cannot risk our being discovered. Could you at least show us the way into the compound? There are tunnels beneath the compound which connect with the control ducts. Show us. If we can determine the compound's geography, we can form a rescue plan. Data? Who's there? Geordi? Captain. We're getting out of here. Come on, hurry! Data was just here. He went to get something. Too late! Lore suggested I try to develop my sense of humour. What do you think? It needs a little work. What's happening? I'm attempting to neutralise your pain receptors. What are you gonna do to me? I am implanting nano-cortical fibres in your cerebrum. They will learn and mimic your neural-firing patterns. Once they are in place, I will destroy the existing brain cells. We'll see if the artificial network can control your cognitive functions. Data, listen. Lore is controlling you. He's transmitting a carrier wave to affect your positronic matrix. If the procedure is a success, your cognition will be considerably improved. Don't you care that he's manipulating you? But there is a 60-percent chance you will not survive the procedure. I don't care much for those odds. They are a cause for concern. However, I still have Troi and Capt Picard. Odds are one of the procedures will succeed. Help me! He tried to escape. The force field sent him into neural shock. If he dies, Lore will blame you! See if the corridor is empty. Drop it, or I will break his neck! Take him! What have you done to him? I will be back for him later. Geordi, are you in pain? No. I'm just a little dizzy. I was able to take part of a transceiver from the guard's interlink system. I think that it uses a kind of phased-pulse technology. Could it be modified to generate a kedion pulse that would reboot Data's program? Yeah, it's possible. See if you can locate the phase circuitry. I'll watch the door. Alright. I think I've found it. OK, good. Do you see anything we might use as a flux inhibitor? No sign of the Borg ship. I'm filtering out the interference. We'll be in transporter range in 19 seconds. I'm getting sensor resolution. There's the ship! We'll enter orbit here! Helm, new course, heading 052, mark seven. Aye, sir. Dropping out of warp in eight seconds. We should have 45 seconds before they intercept. Let's hope it's enough. Emergency deceleration in five seconds. Hold on! Report. We are in orbit, sir. The Borg ship is moving to intercept. Bridge to transporter rooms, begin evacuations. The Borg will be in weapons range in 32 seconds. We can't locate Capt Picard's team, Cmdr Riker or Lt Worf. Crusher to Salazar, report. Pulling the last teams off now. Six people are unaccounted for. Keep trying. They're powering up their weapons. Come on, Chief, it's now or never. They're preparing to fire. Raise shields. Port nacelle has been hit. Helm, get us out of here. We've lost warp engines. Evasive manoeuvres, full impulse. Shields down to 80 percent. Fire phasers. Direct hit, no damage to their ship. Shields down to 73 percent. What's the warp-engine status? Still down. We can't outrun them. Helm, set a new course, heading 344, mark six, full impulse. That heading takes us directly into the sun. The databank should have information on metaphasic shielding. Cmdr La Forge was developing metaphasic properties. How far along was he? It was never tested. With metaphasic shielding, we could enter the sun's corona, but the Borg ship would be unable to follow. Can you bring it on line? I can, but the shields may not hold. Sir, hull temperature is at 12,000 degrees C. Radiation is at 10,000 rads. Report. Shields at 62 percent. Lieutenant, activate the metaphasic program. It's our best shot. Aye, sir. We can't withstand this heat much longer. Program is on line. Engaging metaphasic shield now. Hold temperature dropping. Down to 7,000 degrees. Maintain course. The Borg ship has halted pursuit. All stop. The Borg ship is taking up position relative to ours. They're waiting for us to come out. The question is, how long can we survive in here? Well, I've done everything Geordi told me. Now to activate it. How will we know if it reboots Data's ethical program? By his behaviour. Won't he realise something's up? It's one program among thousands. I just hope that this force field has enough energy to trigger the pulse. You know, Data, I've been thinking about some of the times we've had. Like the time we went sailing on Devala Lake? Remember that? I have a complete memory of that day. You decided to go swimming. When you jumped out of the boat, you sank straight to the bottom. I did not have enough buoyancy to get back up. You walked a kilometre underwater to get back to shore. One kilometre, 46 metres. It took two weeks to get the water out of your servos. I am ready to irradiate your brain cells. Data, if you ever go back to the way you were, you might not be able to forgive yourself for what you're about to do. I am getting anomalous readings from your neural net. I will need to do further testing before I proceed. Someone will take you back to your cell. There you are, brother. Any progress with La Forge? It is too early to tell if the cortical fibres have worked. I suspect none of the humans will survive, but then, it's their own fault, isn't it? They never should have come here. What were they thinking? They came looking for me. Humans are so sentimental. I betrayed them. If they die, I am responsible. Why are you talking like that? Is something wrong with your programming? I should check your systems. I do not want you to check them. I must resolve these issues myself. I think I made a mistake. You can't tolerate the amount of emotion I've given you. Perhaps I should cut back a little. How's that? I do not like it. Then you prefer more emotions? Yes. They give you pleasure? Yes, please. I want more. Alright, a little more. For now. Aren't you going to thank me? Thank you. Don't mention it. I hope this clarifies things for you. I'm concerned about my brother, Crosis. I don't believe he really wants to be a part of our great future. Sir, metaphasic shielding is losing integrity. Can you stabilise it? No. We can only stay here another three or four minutes. Do we have warp engines yet? Not for another half-hour. Sir, I have an idea. We could induce a solar eruption that would destroy the Borg ship. What? We need to direct a particle beam onto the sun's surface. That should produce a gas eruption. If we target the right spot, it will envelop their ship. How do you know this? My honours thesis was on solar dynamics. This isn't the Academy. A thesis is a long way from a workable plan. I've configured the emitters and located the target point on the surface. If her calculations are off, it could encompass us. I'll make sure my calculations are accurate, Lieutenant. Let's do it. Yes, sir. The target area is destabilising. Pressure expansion is accelerating. Fusion has been initiated. An eruption is forming on the surface. She did it! The Borg ship has been destroyed, sir. Take us back to the planet. Full impulse. Aye, sir. Well done, Taitt. You're killing him. He won't survive another session. I did not come for him. I came for you. It's not too late. If you remove the fibres, Geordi could recover. That would not be possible. Why? Because Lore tells you so? It is for the greater good. Good? Data, isn't good and bad, right and wrong, a function of your ethical program? That is correct. What does that program tell you about what you're doing to Geordi? About what you and Lore are doing to the Borg? It tells you these things are wrong, doesn't it, Data? How can actions that are wrong lead to a greater good? You are trying to confuse me. No, you're not confused, Data. You're sensing the truth. Your ethical program is fighting the emotions Lore is sending you. Captain! Thank you so much for joining us. You are going to assist me in a most important ceremony. We'll use the control ducts to get into the compound. That'll lead to the detention area. We have to move fast. If we stun a guard, the Borg will know right away. When they realise, your escape may be compromised. I guess we'll have to take that chance. Good luck, Commander. It's time to put aside all doubts, brother. It's time to close the door on the past and commit yourself to the great work that lies ahead of us. I need to know I can count on you. As proof, I want you to kill Picard. No. That would be wrong. I didn't think you could do it. You've spent too many years among humans. Hold him! I've asked many sacrifices of you. Sacrifices I knew were necessary in order to build a better future. I want you to know that I ask no more of you than I am prepared to give myself. I am willing to make the greatest sacrifice of all. My own dear brother. Goodbye, Data. No! Lore? You should be careful with that, brother. Someone could get hurt! What are you doing? I've got a way out of here. I'm willing to forget what happened back there, and take you with me. We don't need anyone else. We're brothers! I'll give you the chip our father made. It contains much more than just emotions. It has memories! Memories our father wanted you to have. Lore, I must deactivate you now. Without me, you will never feel emotion again. I know. But you leave me no other choice. I love you, brother... Goodbye, Lore. What about Geordi and Troi? The Enterprise is in orbit. I had them beamed aboard. Lore is no longer functioning, sir. He must be disassembled so he is no longer a threat. Welcome back, Data. Thank you, sir. What made you change your mind, Hugh? My encounter with the Enterprise affected me more than I realised. What will you do now? I don't know. We can't go back to the Borg collective and we no longer have a leader here. I'm not sure that's true. Perhaps in time, we will learn to function as individuals and work together as a group. Good luck, Hugh. Goodbye. Captain's log, stardate 47025.4. We've returned to Federation space and are en route to Starbase 295. Mr La Forge remains under Dr Crusher's care. Enter. Hi, Data. Dr Crusher says I'll be able to return to duty soon. I am relieved that the injuries I inflicted on you are not permanent. What's that? It is the chip my father made for me so I could experience emotion. I removed it from Lore before he was dismantled. Does it work? No. I am pleased to say it was damaged when I fired on Lore. Pleased? Data, you've wanted emotions your whole life. Yes. But emotions are responsible for what I did to you. I would never risk letting that happen again. My friendship with you is too important to me. Data, I wouldn't be much of a friend if I let you give up on a lifelong dream, would I? Maybe someday. When you're ready. "
S7E02,"Enter! Worf, they're going to be here any minute. I'm having problems. If I didn't know you, I'd say you were procrastinating. Klingons do not procrastinate. It is a tactical delay. You have to spend five minutes greeting the lyaarans then make small talk for an hour. I have to escort them around for three days! I do not enjoy diplomatic situations. It's all part of being in Starfleet. There. I do not see why it is necessary to wear these ridiculous uniforms. Protocol. They look like dresses. That is such an outmoded, sexist attitude. I'm surprised at you. Besides, you look good in a dress. What's keeping them? You're just in time. They're about to disembark. Ambassadors Loquel, Byleth. I'm Capt Picard. Welcome to the Enterprise. It's a pleasure to be here. It is an honour to host the first cultural exchange between our peoples. The next seven days should prove illuminating. Let me introduce Voval. He will be taking you to our homeworld. How do you do? I'm looking forward to meeting the Premier of lyaar. There will be a reception for you where you will meet my senior staff. I, of course, shall be on my way to your homeworld, but I'll leave you in the hands of my most experienced officers. Lt Worf of the Klingon Empire is my head of security. He'll be in charge of your safety. Counsellor Deanna Troi of the planet Betazed will be your personal liaison officer, Ambassador Loquel. It's an honour to meet you. Would you like to see your quarters? Please. Ambassador Byleth, this is Cmdr William Riker from Earth. He is assigned to you. I want this one. Cmdr Riker is a diplomat with experience in inter-species contact. I'm sure. But I have decided. I want this Lt Worf. Well, that will be just fine. Mr Worf? Yes. Ambassador, it would be my pleasure... Yes, yes. Enough of that. Show me to my quarters. This way. Good luck. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Do you think there's enough food, Data? Good evening. Good evening. Tomorrow, I'll take you on a tour of the operational centres and residential decks. Then we can discuss the culture of your society. Are you eating? Excuse me? There's no food on your plate. I was waiting for the desserts. Desserts? What is this? It's something we eat after the main course. It's usually very sweet. It's usually very bad for you. We eat it for pleasure. For me, it's the best part of any meal. My people eat only for nourishment. Well. Let me introduce you to some of my favourites. This is peach cobbler with whipped cream. Tarvokian powder cake. And this is my favourite. Ktarian chocolate puff. I don't know exactly what's inside, but I think it's made with 17 varieties of chocolate. That is... Delicious? Delicious! Ambassador, I think we're going to get along very well. Shall we? This is unacceptable. I am sorry you do not care for... Bring me new food. I require a higher protein and enzymatic content. It's the custom, in a situation like this, for us to serve ourselves. It's called a buffet. Bring me new food. Ambassador... Doctor, it is alright. I am happy to bring more food. How is your diplomatic assignment? Fine. I have heard that in moments of diplomatic tension, it is often helpful to find elements of commonality. Ambassador Byleth is demanding, temperamental and rude. You share those qualities in abundance. Perhaps you should build on your similarities. So, I understand that your homeworld has some of the most spectacular crystal formations in this sector. Is there any place in particular you recommend I visit while I'm there? No. Well, I... What's our ETA? 17 hours, 32 minutes. I think I'll go update my itinerary. What happened? It's a system-wide power failure. What's the cause? We are in an energy-disruption field. I do not recognise the configuration. Attitude controls failing. There's an M-Class planet nearby. Can we reach it? I will try. Inertial dampers are off line. Life support is failing. Entering the planet's atmosphere. Velocity dropping. Thermal shields at full power. Prepare for impact! Voval! Voval, try not to move. You may have a concussion. Picard to Enterprise. Picard to Enterprise, do you read me? Too much interference. There is a structure of some kind. Some energy readings about two kilometres south of here. Voval, I'm going to try and get help. Do you understand? Now, try to stay conscious. And don't leave the shuttle. There's some kind of plasma energy out on the surface. I'll be back as soon as I can. The Engineering section covers 12 decks of the secondary hull. Deck 42 contains the antimatter-storage facility. What is the rate of the antimatter replenishment stream? Excuse... The antimatter-replenishment rate. What is it? I am not certain. Perhaps there is someone who does know the answer. You! Are you smarter than this one? Why do you ask? Never mind. Take me to the Bussard collectors. This way. This deck is devoted to stellar cartography, biological research and astrophysics. We have 1,000 people... Are you sure you don't want some of this papalla juice? No, thank you. I'm still recovering from all those desserts. Are you sure? It is delicious. I'm sure. Please, please. You've been so kind. Please. Next, we're going to deck eight which is not finished. It's a multipurpose deck. Sometimes, when we need an extra lab or... Ambassador? What is this? It's a child. Child? Children are our offspring. They're our young. They grow into adults over a period of many years. They grow into beings like us. Offspring! Ambassador, I'm curious. How does your species procreate? Postcellular compounding. We emerge from the natal pod fully grown. I see. Do you have a name? Eric. Eric. Do you like dessert? May I give Eric some dessert? That sounds like a wonderful idea. Come on, Eric. Is someone there? Who's there? What do you want? Who are you? Who are you? No, wait! Stop! There was someone else with me. The pilot is injured. He needs your help. He's dead. Hello. Smells good. Thank you. This is a Terellian cargo freighter, isn't it? Is this your ship? Are you one of the crew? No. I was a passenger. We crashed. How many people survived? Were you the only one? You're certainly not a Terellian, unless you've lost two of your arms. What's your name? I'm Jean-Luc Picard. I'm a Starfleet officer. Anna. Anna, are there other people on this planet? How long have you been here? I don't know. You can't see the sun from here. I've lost track of all time. What was the date when you crashed? Stardate 40812. Seven years! Years? Anna, wait a minute. Seven years? I thought one, maybe two. How could it be seven? Anna, listen to me. Listen. On the shuttle, there is equipment that will have survived the crash. We can use it to contact Starfleet. They'll send a ship. We can leave. Leave? Yes. Both of us. Now, if you will help me get to the shuttle... Don't move. It's bad. Don't worry. I won't move. You have three broken ribs. The restrictor device will hold the bones in place, let them... Let them knit? It's been so long since I talked to anyone. I used to talk to myself. But then I thought that it might mean I was crazy. So I stopped talking. It'll be a while before you can walk. Perhaps you could go to the shuttle and bring the equipment back. I can do that. Good. Go in the cockpit, look for a comm panel in the instrument array. See if you can remove it. Bring it back here. Don't move. I'll be back. I am going to kill him with my bare hands. I'll take his throat, rip out his oesophagus... Worf! I have failed in my mission. I am clearly a bad diplomat. For the sake of the ship and the Federation, I request reassignment. Denied. Commander, these lyaarans are arrogant, irritating. They cannot be reasoned with! Ambassador Loquel's quite pleasant. I will admit, he's a little unusual. What have you found out so far? He's preoccupied with recreation. I've spent more time in ten-forward in the last two days than I have in the past two months. He's obsessed with food. Especially chocolate. You must be in heaven! To be honest, he's testing even my limits. You see? They are insane! Worf. You've been very patient with Ambassador Byleth. That's good. But maybe it's time to let him know that some behaviour is unacceptable. It's alright to suggest limits for the Ambassador. Perhaps we should loosen things up, meet in a less official capacity. How about a friendly game of poker? What are you doing? You should be in bed. Anna, why was this door locked from outside? For your protection. From what? There are dangerous animals here. Come sit down. Look, I have the comm panel. Good. It wasn't easy. I had to force it out of the equipment bay. If we can boost the out... the output field, I might be able to send a distress signal. Something seems to be wrong with it. What's the matter? Well, this transmitter module has been totally destroyed. How could that happen? It's been hit by a phaser blast. I used a phaser to cut it free. Maybe I accidentally damaged it. You can fix it, can't you? No. I'm sorry. Anna, we will get out of here. It's not going to be easy, but we must work together. I can't believe I did that. That I damaged our only chance. I've waited for so long! At first, I had hoped that I would be rescued. I kept setting up microfusion flares and looking up at the sky and waiting for someone to come and take me away. But it never happened. There's a precipice near here. I used to go there and I'd stare down at the gorge and I'd think... ...""I can just step over the edge. End it all."" Then I realised it was the hope that was driving me crazy, that I had to accept I would never get out of here. No matter how long it takes, we will get out of here. I knew from the moment I saw you that you were here to save me. I'll do anything you want. Just don't leave me. I don't ever want to be alone again. I love you. I've found some coltayin roots. They're not much to look at but they taste good. What are you doing? You'll hurt yourself. No, no. It's alright. I'm just trying to dislodge this power cell. Nearly got it. There. No, no, it's alright. The energy relays are corroded but it should hold one more charge. If I can regenerate this, I may be able to reactivate the shuttlecraft's engines. Well, I'd say this is cause for a celebration. I may still have some Terellian spices here and I'll boil up these roots and make us a nice broth. That sounds delightful. If we ever do get out of here, will you promise to show me this starship of yours? This Enterprise? Of course. Anna, would you pass me that tricorder? I'm going to try to repair these energy relays. I meant what I said before. I do love you. Anna. I'm very grateful to you for saving my life. I think that you are a very warm, compassionate woman. I feel a great sympathy for what you've been through, alone here on this planet, but I don't think that you can really be in love with me. How can you say that? Of course I love you. No. I'm the first person you've seen in seven years. I'm bringing you the hope of leaving this place. Don't you think that you could possibly be just a little confused right now? So, you're not attracted to me? I think it's a little premature. We hardly know anything about each other. I understand. And I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable. No harm done. It's going to take at least a couple of hours to charge this cell. When it's done, we should get it to the shuttlecraft immediately. This cell casing is already beginning to break down. Anna. We are going to get out of here. The bet is ten. That's to you, Ambassador. I will see the bet and raise ten. I'm in for 20. I'm in. And I raise 20. You are bluffing. Excuse me, Ambassador. Those are my chips. You are in error. They are mine. I saw you take two chips from my pile. You dare to accuse me of stealing? Yes. You are lying because you are losing the game. I am losing because you have been cheating all along! Wait a minute! Calm down. Even if I were cheating, how would a plodding animal like you know it? You are an insulting, pompous fool! If you were not an ambassador, I'd disembowel you here! Do not let my title inhibit you, Klingon. Yes. Good. Stop! Mr Worf! That is an order. Wonderful! Very good! Thank you. Lt Worf, I think I understand now. That was a very effective demonstration. What?! If you'll excuse me, I would like to document this experience. This power cell is ready. We should take it to the shuttle. No! We can't leave right now. Why not? The plasma storms are too strong. It's dangerous. Wait a few hours, then we can go. We don't have a few hours. I told you, this cell is beginning to degenerate. Jean-Luc, it's a difficult journey. The restriction field will make it hard for you to walk. I'm feeling very much better. In fact... ...I don't intend to go on using this any longer. No! You can't remove it yet. No! There's no pain. I have no broken ribs after all. Jean-Luc... What's going on? Why are you trying to keep me here? Please! I love you. Why are you keeping me locked in this freighter? You say there are wild animals, but I haven't heard or seen any. Jean-Luc! And the comm panel? You said you damaged it cutting it from the shuttle. I find it hard to believe that you would destroy the one thing that could get you out of here. And what was this really for? To keep me immobilised? I was afraid! I didn't want you to leave me. So it was necessary to keep me captive? I was scared. I wanted you to stay to love me. I'll look for the shuttle myself. No! Anna! Don't fight me! Anna, no! You should love me now! We're together! We depend on each other. I know more about you. Love me! Anna, stop! I've failed. You don't love me. It's over. Anna! Anna! Anna, where are you going? Hello! Is anyone in there? Yes! Inside here. Hello! Inside the freighter! The door is on the opposite side! Over here! The door's over here! Voval! I thought you were dead. Dead? Yes. There's a woman living here. She said that she saw you dead. Yes. That is understandable. When my species is injured, our metabolism slows until we heal. This state could be mistaken for death. I see. When you did not return, I intended to track you. Surface conditions made it very difficult. So cold! I saw someone running. Was it the woman? Yes. Why did she leave the shelter? She was upset. Do you think she may harm herself? There's a precipice nearby. She was headed that way. It's possible. We should find her. You stay here. Keep warm. I'll look for her. We will go together. Anna! Captain, this ridge extends for a kilometre in either direction. We can search it twice as fast if we separate. Anna! Stay away from me! You don't have to do this. Voval, the shuttle pilot, is still alive. He can help us get away from here. I don't care. I'll jump unless you promise to love me. No. No, I won't promise. You have been manipulating me, haven't you? Jean-Luc, what are you saying? The necklace. It broke! I saw it in the freighter on the floor by the fire. I left it there. Now it's around your neck. It's whole. How? Tell me you love me. I must know. Where's Voval? Isn't it convenient that he arrived moments after you left? That he insisted I come here to look for you? That I find you, here on the ledge, ready to jump? It's good timing, don't you think? Jean-Luc. You and Voval are working together. Only he could have brought you the necklace. Tell me about your love or I'll jump! Go ahead. Why don't you do it? It's a long way down. Must be 200 metres. You'd die instantly, if that's what you want. But I don't think that it really is. I have failed. Failed? Voval, what is going on? My name is Ambassador Voval. Ambassador? My mission was to study human intimacy, specifically the concept you call love. We did not understand certain of your concepts. So we sent three representatives to study them, to experience them. But why did you believe that bringing me here would give you a better understanding of love? Several years ago, we discovered the Terellian freighter. It contained logs written by a single survivor, a human woman. That was our first contact with human culture. She lived alone here for seven years until another human crashed, a human male. And the man was injured and she nursed him back to health and they fell in love. In the logs, she described concepts we found difficult to understand. Pleasure, antagonism, love. These were alien to us. We wished to experience them ourselves. Loquel was sent to experience pleasure. Byleth was sent to experience antagonism. And I was sent to experience love. Was this wrong? Let me just say that... ...we would not take such a direct approach. Ambassador, I have to tell you that in my culture... ...what you have done would be considered a crime. Crime? Well, we'll talk about it later. For now, I think we should get off this planet. Am I right in assuming that the damage to the shuttle is not as bad as it seems? Correct. We can leave at any time. I think that now would be quite nice. You look sore. Lt Worf kindly engaged me in 11 hours of holodeck battle exercises. 11 hours! Yes, I learnt a lot about the concept of antagonism. It was excruciating. These are bioenzymatic supplements we consume for food. I'm afraid they're not as delicious as your chocolate. After the past few days, I could use something a little bland. Goodbye, Ambassador. Fascinating species! Indeed. Thank you, Captain. This has been an enlightening experience. For me as well, Ambassador. I'm sorry if our diplomatic methods offended you. No, on the contrary, I found your approach intriguing. We humans tend to take a rather balanced approach towards life. Never too much, never too little. And it's very nice to find a culture that is willing to take an experience to its furthest extreme. Goodbye, Captain. Ambassador. "
S7E03,"Geordi, have you found it? Not yet. I'm starting to get some fumes. Ammonia, chlorine, potassium chloride. I can feel the heat from here. There it is. How far? About ten metres up the ODN line. Boy, it's hot. I'd say over 2,000 degrees. I'm going in. We're OK. I've activated the emergency suppression system. His vital functions are completely normal. The interface unit is operating within normal parameters. Why did he start coughing? Psychosomatic response. I feel like I'm actually here. I mean there, in the Jefferies tube. When I saw the smoke, I couldn't help but cough. No one has ever had so complete a sensory experience. The interface is perfect for him. His visor inputs allow the probe to transmit directly to his cerebral cortex. It looks like this is going to work. Geordi, I'd like to get the probe out of the Jefferies tube and onto the launch bay before we reach Marijne Vll. Will do. Wait a minute. Something's wrong. Can't get my left leg to work. What is it? The probe responds to any movement Geordi intends to make. When his brain says move his leg, the interface should move the probe. The tactile sensors must be too low. I will increase the input. There it goes. I'm on my way down. Why the bodysuit? It provides tactile sensations. Geordi feels he is in the same environment as the probe. Geordi, what's wrong? Nothing. I'm seeing my reflection in a panel. I forgot what a handsome guy I am. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 47215.5. We're answering a distress call from the science vessel Raman, which is trapped in the atmosphere of an unusual gas-giant planet. We will use an experimental interface probe in our attempt to rescue it. I have reviewed the vessel's mission plans. The Raman was to go to the lower atmosphere, 11,000 kilometres below its current position. The crew was to sample the atmosphere then return to a safer orbit. Something must have happened. Shield failure or some kind of inversion reaction in the nacelles. Any life signs? Our biosensors are useless. Too much interference. The crew might still be alive. We can't tell from up here. Will the probe be able to transmit? The probe's particle beam should cut through the interference. We may have to work at close to tolerance levels. Will your nervous system be able to handle that much input? We've already done tests at 70-percent tolerance. We can go higher. The safety override will kick in at 98-percent tolerance. That'll disengage the interface. Captain. A transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Holt. In my ready room. The seven people on board are our priority. Is the probe ready for launch? Yes, sir. Send it directly to the aft section of the Raman. That's just one bulkhead from the bridge. I'll interface with the probe And take it from there. Make it so. Hello, Marcus. Jean-Luc. How's life on DS3? We're hosting this year's palio. The Ferengi have already been accused of trying to bribe the Breen pilot into throwing the race. There's nothing unusual about that. Nothing at all. I wish I could say I was calling just to catch up on things. Nine days ago, the Hera left here on a routine courier mission. We were in contact with it for five of those days. Then it disappeared without a trace. The Hera? I'm afraid so. The Excelsior and the Noble have been retracing its course for 72 hours. Nothing. I'll keep them at it for another 72. But to be honest, another week would make no difference. I'll inform Cmdr La Forge. I'd like a word with Cmdr La Forge. Aye, sir. I will be on the bridge. Geordi, I just spoke with Starfleet. The Hera is missing. Missing? My mother? Capt La Forge has disappeared along with the rest of her crew. I saw your father last week and your sister ten days before that. I decided I missed my favourite son. Your only son, Ma. You'll have to see the Hera again. We have a lot of new faces. Our new chief engineer juices up the nacelles every chance she gets. I think she's the best technician in the fleet. OK, second best. Come in. Sorry. I didn't know you were... Don't worry. Maybe you should meet her. We'll be in the same sector next week. Take a shuttle over and I'll introduce you. She wants to find me a wife. See you at your father's party. Remember, if you talk to him, it's a surprise. This came in about three weeks ago. I never got back to her. The probe has entered the planet's atmosphere. I'm ready to take it on board. If you need a few days off, I'll run the interface. It's calibrated specifically to my visor's inputs. It would take ten hours to convert. Those crewmen can't wait. The interface doesn't have to be fully compatible. I wouldn't have the control you have, but it would still work. Forget it. I'm the best person for the job. We should proceed as planned. The Hera is reason enough. The Hera is missing, that's all. Until I hear different, my mother could have taken the crew on holiday. Let's go. Captain, the probe is through the airlock and in position on the Raman. Picard to Cmdr Data, report. Ready to bring the interface on line. Proceed. Activating remote sensors. Initiating interface now. Vital signs are normal. Geordi, how do you feel? Fine. Do you have visual contact? Not yet. Turn up the input sensors. I'm not seeing anything. Acknowledged. OK, I can see. But no colours. Increasing signal strength to 75 percent of tolerance. That's better. Your pulse is up. Your nervous system has to get used to the input levels. I'm excited, that's all, Doctor. This is like being on a roller coaster. Or a first date. I'm alright. I'll be the judge of that. If your heart rate gets too high, we'll disconnect you. Understood. It's a mess in here. There must be a breach in the hull someplace. I'm picking up atmospheric gases in the corridor. Methane and ammonia, primarily. That break in the hull might even be on the bridge itself. I'm heading towards the bridge. I've found someone. What is your position? 12 metres up the main corridor. He's trapped under some conduit from the bulkhead. I can't move it. I'll need more power to the tractor beam. Go to 80 percent of tolerance. No higher. He's dead. Data. That door at the end of this corridor. What's it lead to? A magnetic storage bay. If there was a break in the bridge, that'd be the safest place to go. Data, give me a phaser burst. Narrow focus, level-four intensity. I've found them. They're dead. All of 'em. There's a fire in here. Data, disconnect. What happened? Geordi! I don't know. My hands. They're burned. How did this happen? An energy discharge in the suit. Shouldn't the safety overrides stop that? Yes, but I have a theory why they didn't. The interface's tolerance levels were set very high. Geordi's neural response to the input was so strong, it created a feedback loop. The sensors passing the sensation of heat to my hands overloaded. The crew of the Raman are dead. I would like to retrieve them, but not if it risks Geordi's safety. If we turn down the sensory input on the probe, I'll be fine. Seven people died down there. We should at least get their data. Doctor? If we operate the interface at lower input levels, the risk is acceptable. Picard to Riker. Riker here. Proceed with the probe. We'll have to go in at the auxiliary control room. Their bridge is too badly damaged. How long before it's in position? Two hours. We must cut through the bulkhead. Acknowledged. Looks like you'll have time to recuperate. Yeah. There's something I've got to do anyway. How are you, Dad? As well as can be expected, under the circumstances. Are you OK? Yeah. I spoke with your sister this morning. She said she'll be in touch with you in a few days. Right now, she's pretty upset. The service for the Hera will probably be on Vulcan. Most of the crew were from there. But your sister and I want to have a private ceremony. Dad. Don't you think everybody's jumping the gun here? Last I heard, there were still two ships looking for them. They found no debris, no residual warp distortion. And no ship. But that doesn't mean they won't. Starfleet considers the Hera lost. The search isn't much more than a formality at this point. Geordi, your mother's gone. Yeah, well, you can think that if you want. But until I see hard evidence, I won't give up hope. Alright, Geordi. Call me if you need anything. Come in. Data. Still working? No. I have finished adjusting the interface. I am now waiting for Cmdr Riker to finish moving the probe. Do you need to be comforted? No! I was passing by and wondered what you were up to. I am using the time to catch up on my study of poetry. There's nothing on the screen. That is not entirely correct. While the display is currently blank, this emptiness has a poetic meaning. Therefore, it cannot be considered ""nothing"" as such. Says who? The ancient Doosodarians. Much of their poetry contains such lacunae or empty spaces. Often, these pauses measured days, during which poet and audience were encouraged to acknowledge the emptiness of the experience. A few Starfleet Academy lectures seemed that way. Are you certain you do not wish to talk about your mother? Why would you say that? You are no doubt feeling distress. While you claim to be just passing by, that is most likely an excuse to discuss this uncomfortable subject. Am I correct? No, Data. Sometimes ""just passing by"" means just passing by. Then I apologise for my premature assumption. This particular poem has a lacuna of 47 minutes. You may experience the emptiness with me, if you wish. Thanks. You know, Data, maybe you gave up a little too easily. I do not understand. When I said, ""Just passing by means just passing by"", I really didn't mean it. Then my assumption was correct. You do wish to speak of your mother. Am I crazy to think that she's still alive? Your sanity is not in question. However, your evaluation of the available information is biased. She's a starship captain. She's gotten out of impossible situations before. Why is this any different? Disappearances like that of the Hera rarely end with the safe recovery of ship and crew. That makes me feel much better! Look, I'm sorry, Data. I didn't mean to snap at you. I am not offended. You are upset. Your reactions are not surprising. It's just that if, if she really is dead... ...I don't know what I'm gonna do. Receiving the probe's telemetry. Input levels are at 53 percent of tolerance. That's too low, Data. I won't be able to do anything. I'll start with a wide safety margin. We can adjust upward later. Ready? Go ahead. Initiating interface. I can't see anything. I'm increasing the input now. Yeah. That's better, but I need more. Is this level sufficient? Geordi? Geordi, do you hear me? Mom? Mom, is it you? Is it you? I forgot. All you see is this probe. Yes, it's me. I'm on the Enterprise. I'm interfaced with this probe. Geordi? Who are you speaking to? What are you seeing? But is it really you? Yes, Geordi, it's Mom. How can it be? How is it possible? There's no time to explain. We have to go down. Down where? The surface. Geordi, report. Hang on, Doctor. Why? Why do we have to go down to the surface? We're dying. We? The Hera? The Hera is down there? We're disconnecting you now. Wait! We need your help. I need your help. Mom. Geordi. The cut-off has been automatically activated. He's in neural shock. The sensory overload caused no permanent damage, but I wouldn't expose him to that kind of stimulus again. Any idea what caused this hallucination? His brain functions are normal. I told you. I wasn't hallucinating. Geordi, I've analysed the probe's sensor logs. There are no records to indicate a living human presence. She wasn't exactly there. Her ship is on the surface. So you believe what you saw was some kind of transmission? Somehow she has managed to communicate with me. We have no indication of a transmission. Maybe only I can detect it because I'm interfaced with the probe. The probe does allow him to sense quantum fluctuations, subspace anomalies and other phenomena invisible to other sensors. Granted, but how could he perceive his mother visually as if she were in the room? I'm not sure, but our brains weren't designed to process the kind of data Geordi was getting. If the brain receives something it can't understand, it interprets it, sometimes as a smell or a sound, sometimes visually. You see? Geordi. I'm not saying that your mother was really communicating with you. I'm just trying to explain why you thought she was. My mother's ship is trapped down there and we've got to help them. Geordi, the Hera's last reported position was 300 light years away. How could it end up here? If the Hera is on the surface, its hull could not withstand the atmospheric pressure. At least let me go down and see. I do not advise he use the interface. Sensory overload almost killed you. I'll be alright! No, no, I'm not risking your life. Data, find another way of salvaging the Raman. You have two hours. Geordi. I want you to talk to Counsellor Troi. She's expecting you. What's your mother like? If you think I'm going to discuss my childhood, you're way off. That's not what I asked. Well, she's... She's brilliant. Funny. She's incredibly perceptive. She knows people, knows what they're all about even before they speak. She's always been that way. She's a real good judge of character. When was the last time you saw her? About seven months ago. When she took command of the Hera. I went to a party for her crew. She wanted me to come over and see her, but I was really busy then. I suppose I could have made the time to go and see her, but, you know, I just didn't think that... I mean, you know, I... I didn't think that... That it would be your last chance to see her. That's not what I was going to say. I want to suggest something. Call it a theory, alright? Alright. You're worried about your mother's disappearance, guilty you didn't see her when you had the chance, so you're unwilling to consider that she might be dead. Your need to believe she's alive is so strong that it manifests itself as a physical image. But she told me she's trapped on that planet, that she's in danger. If this was wish fulfilment, don't you think I'd be fantasising her safe and sound? No. Because that would be the end of your fantasy. You'd know it wasn't true. The more involved and complicated and unending your story is... ...the longer you can believe your mother's still alive. Well, that's your theory, Counsellor. I've got one of my own. I have explored the idea of using a tractor beam to pull the Raman up. However, the interference prevents a positive lock. If we set up a relay system? That is my conclusion as well. Two shuttles staggered between us and the Raman with their shields refocusing the tractor beam. Can we get the shuttles close enough safely? Mr La Forge? Sure. Yeah, as long as we keep them above the troposphere. Then in that case... But what about the Hera? We'd leave my mother and her crew stranded. Commander... I've been thinking about this. A few weeks ago, I got a message from my mother. She said her new chief engineer had been experimenting with a warp drive. Now, I've seen the Hera. It uses trionic initiators in the warp coil. They have side effects if you play around with them. There have been reports of warp bubbles and subspace deformations. So, what if that's what happened? Not a warp bubble, but a subspace funnel. Connecting two points? The Hera could have created a distortion that emptied out here. Why here? The Hera passed by ten days ago. There's an awful lot of subspace disturbance here. The ship may have picked up traces that directed the funnel back here. So the Hera is somewhere out there? Maybe it's surrounded by a warp field, but who knows for how long? Do you have any evidence to support this hypothesis? I got some odd subspace readings when I was interfaced. That could have been anything. But I talked to her. She said bring the Raman closer to the planet. Mr Data, is any of this possible? Yes, sir. However, it is highly unlikely. How unlikely? Nearly impossible, sir. Start the shuttle plan. Captain... Dismissed. Mr La Forge. I want you to know that I am not unsympathetic to your situation. Your mother's disappearance is tragic, but I cannot risk your safety on a dubious hypothesis. Captain, if I'm right and there's one chance in a million she's alive... I'm sorry, Geordi. My decision is made. I understand, sir. We'll be ready to use the tractor beam in less than an hour. You didn't come all the way down here to say that. No, I didn't. Geordi. I may have seemed harsh about the situation aboard the Raman. But I don't want one of my best officers in unnecessary danger. I guess I feel I should decide whether it's unnecessary or not. My mother died when I was a baby. All I have is pictures, and stories my father used to tell me about her. I begged him to tell those stories over and over. When I was five and I went to school, I told my new friends those same stories, pretending she was alive. Then I started believing she was alive, that she'd just gone away, that she was coming back. The teacher got wind of this... ...and she and my father had a talk with me. They told me it was important to accept the fact that my mother was dead and that she wasn't coming back. And all the hoping in the world wouldn't make it so. In my mind, that was the day that my mother actually died. I cried all that night. But after that, it started feeling better. Your mother was dead. There was proof. A body, a funeral. It was a reality. Geordi... If I could see a body, if there were wreckage, I'd accept it, but my mother has just disappeared. And now, there's a possibility that she is alive. And I'm not gonna quit. Not yet. I suspected you would attempt to operate the interface alone. Did you? I am familiar enough with your behaviour to predict some decisions. I guess you know me pretty well. You are disobeying the Captain. I can't do nothing when my mother may be down on that planet. I cannot allow you to endanger your wellbeing. Data, if I leave without knowing for sure, I'll have to live with that all my life, wondering if I left her to die. I couldn't do that. That's why I've got to do this. I could have you confined to quarters. Then do it. Nothing short of that will stop me from trying to save my mother. What are you doing? I will monitor the interface and attempt to keep you safe. I cannot confine you to quarters for something you have not yet done. We could both get in a lot of trouble. There is a high degree of probability that you are correct. Thanks, Data. However, I do have a request. Yeah? What's that? I ask you to consider the possibility that what you see is not real. I will. I promise. I am establishing the interface. Mom? Mom? Hello, Geordi. Mom! How did you get here? I'm not really with you, Geordi, I'm on my ship, on the surface. We were pulled into a warp funnel. That's just what I thought. How are we communicating? We found a way to cut through the atmospheric interference. Geordi, are you seeing your mother's image? Yes. She's confirmed everything I said. I am reading unusual subspace energy similar to what the probe recorded when you first met your mother. That's how she's communicating. It's the only signal that could cut through the interference. We need your help. I've been thinking about this. I'm going to take the Raman into a low stationary orbit and initiate an inverse warp cascade. Why? The distortion from the cascade should reverse the warp funnel. Your ship will end up back where it started. The atmosphere is more turbulent the farther down you go. You may not get the Raman near to the Hera before being destroyed. I have to try. We're running out of time. Shield back on line. We're starting our descent. Thank God! Thank God? That you're alive. That I was right about all this. I can't wait to call Dad. He and Ariana had given up. We're going home. Well, eventually, yes. Data! Everything's fading in and out. I'm losing the interface. The probe moving is out of range. Turn up the input gain to keep me connected. We are already at 75 percent of tolerance. Data! You can turn it all the way up to 100 if you do it slowly enough, so my nervous system can adjust. That is theoretically true. But even at this level, you are already experiencing dangerous neural feedback. There are over 300 people on board the Hera. You and I are the only chance they've got. I will increase the gain incrementally as you descend. It's working. When we disconnect the interface, we need time to lower the input levels or your nervous system will go into shock. Once I start the warp cascade, we can start dropping the gain. Understood. We'll be within sensor range of the Hera in a few minutes. Mom, I'm really sorry I didn't get by to see you a few weeks ago. You were too busy with work. Yeah, well, I'm sorry. It won't happen again. Captain, the Raman is descending toward the planet. Geordi! We are at 90 percent of tolerance. I calculate you will reach 100 percent before you reach the Hera. Then we go beyond tolerance. That is not advisable. You must cease your descent. No, Geordi, don't, please. Data, I'm taking this ship down. If you don't boost the gain past tolerance levels, I'll lose the interface and go into shock. Geordi, you are putting me in a difficult position. Please, cease your descent. I won't do it, Data. Increase the tolerance. Disengaging safety systems. Going to full tolerance levels now. Thank you, Data. We're getting close. Thank God! Cmdr La Forge! Yes, Captain? Stop your descent. Disengage the interface. Sorry, Captain, I can't do that. Damn it, Geordi, you'll kill yourself! If I come back now, my mother and her entire crew will die. I'm scanning for your ship. I'm not getting anything. We're still too far away. No, not really. I should be picking something up by now. I'm not finding anything. There's no warp funnel, no ship. There's nothing there! Doctor, report? His synapses are overloading. He can't survive! Geordi, what's happening? Reverse tractor beam. Reversing tractor beam. What are you? You're killing us. We must go down! Geordi. What's happening? Report. You're trapped? Is there any way to disconnect him? If we take him off too abruptly, he'll go into neural shock. Caught on the ship? Reduce the input gradually, but get him out. You killed the Raman's crew? We can deceive his receptors. Deceive them? Feed them sensory data from his earlier experiences with the probe. Disconnect the interface but maintain the input levels. Then lower them in a controlled way. What do you want? Like a decompression tank? Try it. It was an accident? Captain, I have to take the ship lower. Explain. As I understand, when the Raman neared the planet, it accidentally picked up some life forms that live in the atmosphere. Subspace beings, intelligent. When the ship went higher, the beings were trapped. How do you know all this? One of them can communicate. It must have read my thoughts via the probe and took the form of my mother to persuade me to take the ship lower. Are they responsible for the death of the Raman's crew? Yes, but not on purpose. They probably tried communicating with them the way they are with me, by accessing their thoughts. It must have been fatal to the crew. I guess the interface is what protected me. I have to take them back, Captain. They can't survive so far up in the atmosphere. I'll turn the ship and come back just as soon as I'm... What's happening? The atmosphere is getting turbulent. It's overloading the systems. It's difficult keeping the shields up. Geordi. We're safe now. Goodbye. I'm losing power. Shield failure in eight seconds. Can we switch the input? Almost. Shields are failing. Switching inputs. Is it working? His vital signs are stabilising. He's going to make it. Captain's log, supplemental. We have disengaged Mr La Forge from the interface and are en route to Starbase 495. You disobeyed my direct order. You put yourself in grave danger. I am not happy. Yes, sir. I take complete responsibility. Data was... I will deal with Mr Data later. Meanwhile, I have to write this into your permanent record. Yes, sir. Dismissed. Geordi. I'm very sorry you didn't find your mother. Thank you, sir. You know, it's funny. When I was down there, it was so real. I felt like I had a chance to say goodbye. "
S7E04,"So, tell me, why is it so important that you find this man? We had business dealings. He owes me money. If we had business dealings, I can tell you I wouldn't disappear. Maybe we can discuss that possibility. But first, I have to find him, collect the money I'm owed. I'll be closing in a few hours. Perhaps we could discuss this more privately. If I don't find him, I'm going to have to move on. Are you sure you haven't seen him? Human, about two metres tall, smooth-headed. No. I don't remember anyone like that. You're lying. And you're a Betazoid. I thought so. Listen. People that come in here, they count on a certain amount of anonymity. And if I were to start answering questions about them, even to a very beautiful woman, well, I wouldn't be in business very long. And being a businesswoman, I'm sure you understand. Great story. I'll remember it next time I'm in a knife fight. Any luck? I think that one knows something. He would not admit to having seen the Captain, but he said anyone who visited the ruins would come here eventually. I suspect he knows more. Let's go. Commander, I told... I'm told you know about the man we want. The only reason I'm talking to you is that I have a sister, too. I explained that we are looking for a man who impregnated your sister. You can see what this means to me. Family honour is important. If someone had defiled my sister, I would do or pay anything To find the one responsible. How much is ""anything""? As much as five bars of gold-pressed latinum. I think you've had too much to drink. You'd better leave. On your way, Yranac. I'm sorry, but I think he wants to stay. Sit down. That's my sister. She's angry. Vicious temper. I wouldn't cross her. You say one word and you're a dead man. Perhaps there's an element of risk that I did not appreciate. And how much more latinum will it take to offset this risk? This isn't about latinum. As a man with a sister, one with a temper, I can sympathise, but how did you come here? Do you have a ship in orbit? Yes. Take me with you. Drop me anywhere. Agreed. Now, talk. The man you want was here several weeks ago, questioning some aliens. Who were these aliens? I don't know. They looked dangerous. They attacked him. He incapacitated three of them before they got him. He was thrown against that wall, and fell there. I'm getting Starfleet fibre traces and human-cell debris. Can you get a DNA reading? There's something strange. The cell structures are distorted, as if by a high-energy field. A weapon discharge? It could be. I've got traces of microcrystalline damage in the floor. But I'm not familiar with this pattern. Who are you people? You didn't mention a weapon. I hadn't finished. You'll like this. The man got what was coming to him. When they knocked him down, one of them took out a weapon and fired. He was vaporised. He's telling the truth. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Acting Captain's log, stardate 47135.2. Dr Crusher has identified Capt Picard's DNA. There is no doubt now that he is dead. Come. How are you doing? I'm alright. The crew's pretty shaken up. I'm arranging a memorial. I think you should deliver the eulogy. I think you'd be better at that. Or Beverly. She knew him the longest. I know it's not going to be easy, but we must face what's happened. You're in command now. The crew needs guidance from you. I can't give the eulogy because I won't be at the service. A memorial service gives everyone a sense of completion, helps begin healing. Exactly. I don't want to heal. Will... I have an open wound here. It hurts like hell. I don't want it to get better and I don't want to pretend everything's alright. I know you're angry. You're damn right! I intend to stay angry until I find whoever's responsible for the Captain's death. That's pretty selfish of you. Do you think you're the only one in pain? Do you think that you have the monopoly on loss? Well, let me tell you something. We're all hurting. We're all angry. And, like it or not, you have a responsibility to this crew. You can't just indulge your personal desire for revenge. That is enough, Counsellor. Deanna. I'm sorry. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. The Captain died in a bar fight for nothing. Somebody has to answer for that. Then I can mourn. Commander, a transmission from Admiral Chekote at Starbase 227. I'll take it in the ready room. Aye, sir. Sir? I read your report, Commander. My condolences to you and your crew. Capt Picard's death is a loss to the entire Federation. You want to postpone your mission to the Argus sector. For what reason? I have a request. I would like to investigate Capt Picard's death. It's the Dessicans'jurisdiction. I know, sir. Frankly, I don't have much confidence in them. I believe they're corrupt. I suspect you're right. But are you the one to pursue this? The Captain's death hit me hard and I may not be completely objective. But no one is more determined to find out who is responsible. Alright, Commander. I'm placing the Enterprise on detached duty. Your mission is at your discretion. Good luck. Thank you, sir. Cmdr Riker. I've been meaning to speak to you. I'd like to move to better quarters. I don't care much for the decor here. These are our best quarters. I was hoping that you might have remembered details of the aliens you saw, things you may have forgotten. Sorry, my memory isn't what it used to be. They murdered a man in full sight of everyone, and you remember nothing about them? Now that you mention it, I remember one thing. They said they'd kill anyone who talked about it. Where did they go? So you know who they are, and where I can find them. Perhaps I do. What do you want? Not a great deal, Commander. Just a shuttlecraft. I'd like to travel, see more of the galaxy. A shuttlecraft? Well, here's my offer. Instead of the ship, I'll give you some time. Time? With luck, five years in prison, instead of 20. You have 12 outstanding arrest warrants in the Klingon Empire. Tell me what you know, and I'll pull some strings. Maybe they'll reduce your sentence. You must promise not to give me to the Klingons. I'll think about it. Could I be sent to a Federation rehabilitation colony? Talk. The aliens were a mercenary group. They've been operating in the sector for six months. Where do we find them? They mentioned the Barradas system. I think they were headed there. You think? That's all I know. Riker to Data. Data here. Take us out of orbit, set course for the Barradas system. Warp six. Aye, sir. Barradas III is a Class-M planet, and is listed as unpopulated. But sensors have detected energy signals on its surface. What's the source? It's hard to tell, but possibly from a power converter. Indicating a base or a ship. What else do we know? The planet was a Debrune outpost 2,000 years ago. The Federation's archaeological survey has catalogued numerous ruins on the surface. Mr Worf, we need a security detail with the away team. I'll lead. Geordi, you're with me. Mr Data, you have the bridge. Commander, as acting First Officer, I question your decision to accompany the away team. If the Captain were here... He's not. No, but if he were, and he wanted to lead an away team, you would say the Captain's place... Is on the bridge. Not this time. Ensign, take that area. Yes, sir. Geordi? It's hard to get accurate readings. There's a lot of interference. From what? I'm not sure. It's very unlocalised. It could be atmospheric. What do you make of these? Well, these ruins are pretty ancient, but this indentation looks recent. Could be the site of some battle. This doesn't look like a blast point. The shape is too perfect. Commander, there's microcrystalline damage everywhere. The same pattern Dr Crusher picked up on the floor of that bar. Commander! I found something. Someone could have just dropped them. Enterprise, we are under attack. We are under attack... We've lost contact with the away team. Is there a malfunction? No, we're being jammed. What is the source? Somewhere on the surface. Bridge to transporter room two. Can you get a lock on them? Negative. There's too much interference. If I can get to those trees, we might be able to set up a crossfire. Data to away team, please respond. Data, we've been attacked. One casualty, and Cmdr Riker has been captured. The mercenaries beamed away. They must have a base or ship nearby. Anything on the sensors? We're picking up a vessel leaving orbit. Why was it not detected earlier? They used the planet as a shield. They're powering up their weapons. Raise shields. Red alert. Damage report. Minor hit on the port deflector. No damage. They're running. They're at warp 8.7. I think they're at maximum. Go to warp nine and pursue. Lock phasers on target. Sir, we should be within phaser range in 23 seconds. Switching to long-range scanners. The sensor image of that ship is extremely weak. It's fading. The ship doesn't register on the long-range sensors. I'm sorry, sir. We've lost them. Increase the sensor field. Patch in lateral sensor arrays. It's no good, the signal's gone. It just disappeared. Take us back to Barradas III. Notify the away team to prepare for transport. Starfleet Intelligence confirms that a ship of this configuration is linked to raids on nearby planets. While it was within visual range, we took sensor readings of the vessel. It seems to be encased in an energy-absorbing material. We can see the ship, but this energy sheath renders it virtually undetectable to our long-range sensors. There must be a way to track it. Data, it's a long shot, but if I remodulate the long-range sensor array, it might be sensitive enough to detect the ship. Without analysing the energy sheath, chances of a correct remodulation are remote. Sir, they have taken Cmdr Riker. We cannot just sit here. On the contrary, Lieutenant, that is precisely what we must do. There is no alternative. We will return to the surface and try to determine why the mercenaries are here. An investigation might reveal their purpose. Notify me when you have assembled your search teams. Dismissed. What's the problem? I said not to push the engine. It's on the verge of collapse. We'll be lucky to maintain warp six. How long till it's fixed? I can try to realign the warp core. It'll take 11 hours, but I'll have to shut the engines down completely. We're not stopping. We can't sit helpless in space. I want warp eight in five hours. I don't want to hear your excuses. What were you doing on Barradas III? William T Riker, Commander, SC, 231-427. Really? Well, I am Arctus Baran, and I don't have a number. Now, what were you doing on Barradas III? We were studying the ruins. It was a scientific expedition. Don't patronise me. Those ruins have been studied for centuries. There's nothing new to learn. Then why were you there? Don't bother. You can't remove it. It's connected to your nervous system. It lets me control precisely how much pain you feel. This setting is usually sufficient. However, if necessary, it can go much higher. These devices were my predecessor's idea. It's a convenient way of enforcing discipline. What happened to him? He failed to enforce it with me. This is a waste of time, Baran. Get rid of him now. You should be more patient, Vekor. It might be rewarding. We will wait. Let the memory of pain argue with him for a while. It might change his attitude. Vekor is right. We should get rid of him. It's dangerous having a Starfleet man on board. Dangerous? It might be profitable. A Starfleet commander is a valuable hostage. Starfleet won't negotiate. They'll pursue us. This discussion is over. Get back to your post. They're right, Baran, and you know it. I say kill him. Now. If he has nothing to give us, we should kill him now. Everybody recognises that except you. I don't need a consensus to run this ship. What's going on? I'm bypassing the aft plasma couplings. The power loss should only last for a few seconds. You should learn not to limit your options. Riker could be very useful. He may not be that useful, if this is the same Riker that I've heard about. What Riker might that be? Commander of the Enterprise, formerly assigned to the USS Hood. That's right. Then you're the William T Riker with a history of insubordination. He was even once relieved of duty during the Cardassian incident at Minos Korva. How do you know all this? I've smuggled artefacts from Federation sites for years. You end up developing a familiarity with certain Starfleet personnel. If we hadn't caught him, he'd probably have been court-martialled. I've gotten out of them before. Look, he's no use to us. Finish him now. Let me do it for you. Watch him. We're accelerating. What have you done? It's nothing to do with my repairs. It's a malfunction in the intermix chamber. Plasma pressure is rising. Where's the malfunction? It could be one of 30 subsystems. It'll take time to locate. You won't have a chance. Pressure is critical. Seal off the intermix chamber. I can't. Override won't engage. The antimatter flow regulator is locked open. Subsystems still not responding. Get out of the way. Pressure is beyond maximum. Eight percent above critical. Jettison the core. No, we'll be stranded. The flow regulator is frozen. Let me do it. I've had a lot of experience. Maybe I can do something. 11 percent above critical. The containment fields will degrade. Go. The regulator is not responding. Containment fields won't hold much longer. Looks like a logic lockout in the regulator subsystem. We'll run a bypass through the plasma flow converter. Run phase-lock feedback through that regulator. I want a six-second delay. What? I don't take orders from you. Do as he says. 14 percent above critical. If you fail... We'll all be dead anyway. Just a few more seconds. Plasma pressure is dropping. We're back into safe levels. If you don't want that to happen again, reinitiate your regulator sub-compressors, and do a full diagnostic of the intermix chamber. Do it. Put him in quarters for now. You still wish you'd killed me? The search teams have found several archaeological sites. Each one has been looted. It's possible that the microcrystalline damage is caused by a high-energy transporter beam. But I still don't understand. Nothing here is very valuable. Why would anyone want to steal anything? Perhaps the Romulans value them. The Romulans? These structures were built by the Debrune. That race is an ancient offshoot of the Romulans. The ruins on the planet where the Captain died were also Romulan. The leader of our attackers was Romulan. Perhaps they control the mercenaries. The question remains, why are they stealing the artefacts? There are several sites in this sector with ruins of Romulan origin. These were attacked by the mercenaries. They did a thorough job. The only sites not attacked were Calder II, Yadalla Prime and Draken IV. Yadalla and Draken are at the end of the sector. Calder II is less than a day away at maximum warp. That would be their next likely target. There's a Federation outpost there. A small science station with limited defence capabilities. I doubt it could withstand an attack from the mercenaries. Mr Worf, contact the Federation outpost on Calder II. Advise them that if a ship similar to the mercenary vessel approaches, they should delay it until our arrival. Ensign, take us out of orbit. Set a course for the Calder system. Warp nine. Aye, sir. We don't have much time. It's good to see you. I didn't expect to meet you here. I was looking for the people who killed you. A witness saw you vaporised. The mercenaries use weapons that activate their transporter. It gives them the opportunity to beam things away quickly by firing at them. That's what they did to me. I don't understand. Who are they? Why are you involved with them? The site I wanted to study had been raided. A lot of the artefacts stolen. The site was practically destroyed. I wanted to know who was responsible. I tracked them to that bar on Dessica II. I must have asked too many questions. They captured me to find out how much I knew about them. Then you joined their crew? I convinced them I was a smuggler and that my name was Galen. I offered to appraise the artefacts they had stolen. Will, these are not common thieves. They are stealing Romulan artefacts from sites throughout this sector. Baran has me analysing each one for a particular particle signature. They are looking for a specific artefact. Why? That's what we have to find out. Baran is the key. He knows the most about what we're after. Get close to him. Get his confidence. You set up the engine failure because you knew I could fix it. And he believes you're a less than perfect Starfleet officer. Play into that role. Baran and I... Well, he doesn't care much for me, but he has to tolerate me, because he needs my help with these artefacts. But if you and I become enemies, then there's a better chance of you and he becoming friends. Alright. I'll do what I can. What are you doing here? Getting some answers, because you can't get him to talk. No one conducts an interrogation on this ship without my permission. Is that understood? Our next objective should prove an interesting challenge. We're headed for the Sakethan burial mounds on Calder II. What? Calder II isn't just another archaeological site. It's a Federation outpost. That's not a problem. It's defended by Starfleet. They're not just going to stand by and let us take what we want. I'm familiar with the tactical situation. What are their defences? Nothing to worry about. A type-four deflector shield around the outpost and ruins. They also have a minimum of two phaser banks and possibly photon torpedoes. Is that enough to worry about? How do you know so much about this outpost? I tried to smuggle a Sakethan glyph stone out of there nearly two years ago. I barely got away in one piece. Our weapons are more than a match for their defences. We should be able to destroy the outpost within 15 minutes. Then we'll send a landing party to secure the relics. Why don't we use Riker? He's a Starfleet commander. He could talk us past Security without raising suspicions. With their shields down, we can beam the artefacts up from here. Why would Riker help? Being out of favour with Starfleet doesn't mean he'll betray them. If he doesn't help, we'll destroy the outpost and kill people. He's still a Starfleet officer. He won't want to take innocent lives if he can prevent it. The last time we engaged Starfleet, we lost a man. No more casualties. If we can avoid a battle, we should. Alright, we'll try it. We'll be at Calder II in five hours. You know your duties. I want the ship prepared for battle, in case your plan doesn't work. Computer, reset diagnostic for a new sample. Lot number 478-B. Access spectral analysis and begin scan, mode three. Scan complete. Particle-decay profile does not fall within specified range. Probability of match, 0.04 percent. Computer, reset diagnostic for new sample, lot number 369-B. Access spectral analysis, mode two, begin scan. Baran wants the analysis of the last lot. He thinks you're too slow. Tell him, if he wants the analysis done faster, he can do it. If he wants it done correctly, he can wait. Do you enjoy living dangerously? Baran can kill you instantly with his control device. I doubt he'll do that. I've increased the accuracy of identification by a factor of 10. I'm the best person to analyse these artefacts, and he knows it. He may need you now, but I know Baran. And I can tell you, he won't back down forever. You accomplish nothing by provoking him. I don't like operating in the dark. If I knew the point of this mission, why I was analysing these relics... If Baran felt the crew needed to be told, he would have. Do you know what all this is about? What Baran knows, I know. Then what's going on here? Why are we risking our lives for these artefacts? Who wants them? I see no reason to tell you anything. But you can rest assured, I don't necessarily share everything I know with Baran either. This conversation, for example, will stay between us. You can tell Baran every word I've said. He knows I don't think much of him as a leader. He's been in charge for a long time. Baran wouldn't last five minutes without his control device. The crew follow him because they have no choice. Baran's power is based on fear and intimidation. That sounds like a prelude to mutiny. If someone challenged him, the crew would follow. I was right. You do like living dangerously. I like you, Galen. I can tolerate a lot from someone like you, but only to a point. I intend to complete this mission and get what's been promised me. If it looks like you're getting in the way, I'll deal with you myself. Commander, no one is allowed on the surface without prior authorisation. I'm aware of that, Lieutenant. But your outpost is in danger of attack. I want to station security personnel on the surface for your protection. Now, I'm ordering you to drop your shields. I'm sorry, sir, the regulations are very specific. I can't do it. You can stay in orbit until we contact the Science Council. But we're experiencing communication difficulties... This isn't working. They're delaying on purpose. Someone has warned them. Charge main disruptor array. Destroy the outpost. There's no time for that! Starfleet are on the way. What are you doing? I'll fire a phase-resonant pulse. If I hit their shield generator with the right frequency, I can take it out with one shot. Firing. Shields are down. The artefacts are in several small structures, Arranged in staggered formations. I'm scanning. I think I've found them. Start bringing them up. There should be at least two more down there. I've lost transporter lock. Their shields are back up. I need those artefacts. Lock all disruptors on target. This time, I want that outpost destroyed. Direct hit on their aft deflectors, but no damage. Ensign, scan for Starfleet combat signals. Is Cmdr Riker on board? I can't tell. Sensors unable to penetrate their hull. Open a channel. This is the Federation Starship Enterprise. We order you to stand down. Prepare to be boarded. You sent them a message. You told them where we are. That's ridiculous. How? This is set to kill. Order your ship to disengage. Activate visual. Commander, are you alright? Tell him. Mr Data, withdraw the Enterprise. That's an order. That is impossible, sir. That ship has violated a Federation outpost. It is my duty to stop it. I'm your commanding officer. That is a direct order, understood? Commander, if you could explain... I've never explained my orders before. I'm not starting now. I won't let him blow this ship into space. If I can set up a low-level commlink, I can use my personal codes to deactivate the shields. Do it. Sir, we are receiving some kind of signal from the mercenaries' ship. Cmdr Riker's sending his codes to try to shut down our shields. But he'll know we changed the codes as soon as he was captured. That is correct, Counsellor. He does know. Mr Worf, prepare to drop shields. Sir, we would be totally defenceless. I am aware of that. Sir, when they see... Mr Worf, that is an order. Aye, sir. It worked. The shields are dropping. Fire. "
S7E05,"Last time, on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". I'm told you know about the man we want. There were some aliens. He was asking them questions. One of them took out a weapon and fired. He was vaporised. This is about justice. The Captain died in a bar fight for nothing. Those ruins have been studied for centuries. There's nothing new to learn. Then why were you there? Baran wouldn't last five minutes without his control device. That sounds like a prelude to mutiny. They captured me to find out how much I knew about them. Then you joined their crew? I convinced them I was a smuggler. Will, these are not common thieves. They are stealing Romulan artefacts from sites throughout this sector. Mr Worf, prepare to drop shields. Sir, we would be totally defenceless. I am aware of that. Fire. And now, the conclusion. Direct hit to the port nacelle. Only minimal damage. Hit to starboard. No appreciable damage. Will did something to their weapons. I believe you are right. It is now up to us to play along. Release inertial dampers and cut power to decks 31 through 37. Set phasers to 25 percent. Return fire. Aye, sir. Continue firing. I've lost three plasma relays. Auxiliary power is not available. Transfer weapons control to my station. We can feed power... The antimatter units are buckling. The Enterprise is damaged, but they have superior firepower. If we stay here, we'll be destroyed. The logical response is to withdraw. We've done enough damage. Narik, set course. 180, mark 215. Warp six. Initiate. They're activating warp drive. Sir, we cannot track them if they go to warp. I can disable them... I am aware of the tactical situation. Let them go. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. I've gone over every word, every inflection, every facial response. I still can't find a hidden message. The existence of such a message is remote, but we should check. I'll keep trying. Two starships will intercept the mercenaries at Yadalla Prime and Draken IV, in case they attack those planets. Inform Starfleet Command that we will hold position. So, we are just going to remain here? Yes, but we will pursue all avenues of investigation. If we had not let them escape, this would not be necessary. Yes. But I believe Cmdr Riker wanted us to let them escape. I've found something. I've studied the commlink Riker used to transmit his codes. I ran the transmission through a subharmonic analysis. I found this. It was sent with the command codes. The message we're looking for? Possibly. I will attempt to resequence the signal. Begin searching for a decryption key. I'm taking the engines off line. How long will the repairs take? At least five hours to replace the antimatter-containment unit. You have three hours, Narik. One minute more and you'll answer with your life. I suppose I should thank you. None of us would be alive if it weren't for you. You're welcome. What's wrong, Commander? Having second thoughts about betraying your comrades? Because that's what you've done. Betrayed them. Betrayed them to save yourself. You used to be just a second-rate officer. Now you're a traitor and a coward! How does that feel? I don't know. How did that feel? Enough! Galen, go down to the cargo hold and check out those artefacts. Move! You can tell Baran that I'm working as fast as I can. What? I can't decide if you're incredibly stupid or incredibly smart. Why didn't you fire on the Enterprise When their shields dropped? The disruptors lost power. Computer, reset for diagnostic of new sample. Begin scan. I've watched you handle the weapons systems before. You knew how to bypass that problem. Why do you keep arguing with Riker? It's obvious that by alienating Riker, you alienate Baran and yet you continue to do so. Why? Scan complete. Terikon profile negative. Computer, reset diagnostic for new sample and begin scan. This isn't a Romulan jail. I don't have to answer your questions. And I don't give a damn what you think. Scan complete. Terikon profile positive. 98 percent probability of match. Well, whatever it is we're looking for, it seems that we've found it. Tallera to Captain. What is it? Galen's made a positive terikon match. On an artefact. Good. Bring it to me immediately. Don't let anyone get near it. Understood. Tallera out. That sounds like good news. Very. We've completed half of what should be a very profitable mission. And better, I'm almost ready to get rid of your friend Galen. Really? There's one more artefact to find. Once Galen confirms that it's genuine, his usefulness on this ship will come to a very sudden end. I can't say I'm sorry to hear that. Galen might be a loudmouthed fool, but sometimes he's perceptive. His observations about you, for instance. After what you did on Calder II, I doubt you have much of a future in Starfleet. Yes, I must say I've come to the same conclusion. Well, assuming that you were not my prisoner, what would you do now? I guess I'd start looking for a new career. There must be a place where someone with 15 years of Starfleet technical knowledge would be useful. You wouldn't know a place like that? Well... Well, possibly. However, one thing I've learned on these ships is to be cautious and never to blindly embrace what might appear to be good fortune. And right now, you're a rather large stroke of good luck. I haven't exactly sworn undying allegiance to you, either. For instance, I'd like to know more about this job. Such as? Such as what you meant by a ""very profitable"" mission. It's enough to know that your share will ensure you a very wealthy and long life Far from the Federation. Sounds promising. It is. But you'll have to earn it. You can start by becoming Galen's friend. Why? Galen has allies on this ship. They could cause trouble if I decide to kill him. I want you to find out from him who they are. OK. One more thing, Riker. When the time comes, I want you to kill Galen. I have analysed the signal from the mercenary ship. I believe these groupings are bearings from the navigation system. This is their flight plan? Yes. If I am correct, the mercenary ship is headed to the Hyralan sector. Their maximum speed is warp 8.7. It would take them 14 hours to reach that position. We could be there in five. Make it so. Finally. Set a course for the Hyralan sector. Warp nine. Aye, sir. Lieutenant, may I see you in the ready room? Of course. I am dissatisfied with your performance. May I ask in what way? You question my orders in front of the crew. This is not appropriate behaviour. With all due respect, I have always voiced my opinions, even when they differ from Capt Picard's. But in those situations, you were Head of Security, not First Officer. The second-in-command carries out the decisions of the captain, in this case, me. But is it not my duty to offer you alternatives? Yes. But once I have made a decision, you must carry it out regardless of how you feel. Any objections should be given to me in private. I do not recall Cmdr Riker ever publicly showing irritation, as you just did. No, sir. If you cannot carry out this role, I will assign it to La Forge and return you to Tactical, recording it not as a reprimand, but as a transfer. I would prefer to remain at my current post. Then I expect you to conform to my guidelines. Aye, sir. Dismissed. Mr Worf, I am sorry if I have ended our friendship. Sir, it is I who has jeopardised our friendship, not you. If you will overlook this, I would like to continue to consider you my friend. I would like that as well. Thank you, sir. Good to see you, too. I've had some unpleasant surprises. This isn't a good idea. Baran might grow suspicious. It was Baran who sent me here. He told me to pretend to be friendly with you and help organise a mutiny, so he can determine who your supporters are and eliminate them. What a tangled web we weave. I can't remember whose side I'm on. What have you found out? In the Hyralan sector, we're to rendezvous with a Klingon ship. I think they're delivering another Romulan artefact to us. A second artefact? By the way, that first artefact is not Romulan. It's Vulcan. Vulcan?! I have been looking over the glyphs from the Calder II artefact. Although I don't have enough data to translate it all, the alphabet and the symbology is much more consistent with early Vulcan than Romulan. Do the artefacts have a religious or cultural significance which makes them valuable enough to kill for? I don't know. If I could access the Enterprise computer for a few moments... So, what will Baran do once he's obtained the second artefact? After you verify its authenticity, I kill you and take your place. You always seem to be after my job. As soon as Baran feels I'm no more use, he can kill me with the neural-servo. So, we'd better start planning a mutiny. We need a new captain and I've come to one conclusion... I agree. But I don't think that's you. I don't trust you. Nor does the rest of the crew. They won't follow you. Then who will they follow? You? No, but they will follow Tallera, and so will I. Who are you? What? You're no smuggler and your name's not Galen. Tell me who you are and what you're doing on this ship or I will kill you right here. What are you talking about? I will not play games with you. I found the message you sent to the Enterprise. When Riker used his command codes, you sent a transmission with them. You're a Starfleet officer. Do not deny it. It is the only logical conclusion. My name is actually T'Paal. I am a member of the V'Shar. Vulcan Security? That is correct. I infiltrated this ship a year ago posing as a Romulan mercenary. I'm here to investigate a possible threat to Vulcan. What sort of threat? First things first, Galen. Who are you? I'm Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. Very well. To answer your question, there is a small but growing movement of extreme isolationists on Vulcan. A group that believes contact with alien races has polluted our culture and is destroying Vulcan purity. This group advocates isolation from the rest of the galaxy and the eradication of all alien influences from our planet. That sounds like an illogical philosophy. Agreed. But extremists often have a logic all their own. Tell me, what are these artefacts we've been collecting? I know they are Vulcan in origin. You are familiar with the ancient history of my people before we found logic, before we found peace. You were much as my people once were. Savage, warlike. There was even a time when we used our telepathic abilities as a weapon, a time when we learned to kill with a thought. The Stone of Gol! You know of it? I know the story from Vulcan mythology. The Stone of Gol is real, but there is nothing magical about it. It is a psionic resonator, a device which focuses and amplifies telepathic energy. It is one of the most devastating weapons ever conceived. But according to the legend, the stone was destroyed by the gods. The resonator was thought destroyed during the Time of the Awakening. Only one piece survived. It was placed in a museum under heavy guard. A year ago, that piece was stolen from the museum. Soon after, mercenary ships began raiding archaeological sites across the quadrant. A member of the isolationist movement is attempting to reassemble the resonator. A telepathic weapon! My orders are to find that assassin and stop him. It would seem that Baran has to deliver these artefacts to the assassin in order to get paid. Therefore, you and I should continue our masquerade. Agreed. But, Captain, I cannot allow the resonator to be assembled. If necessary, I will destroy this ship, its crew, all of us, to prevent that from happening. Acting Captain's log, stardate 47160. 1. We are entering the Hyralan sector, which I believe to be the next destination of the mercenary ship. I am picking up a small vessel bearing 127, mark 335. Is it the mercenary ship? No, sir. It's a Klingon ship. A Toron-class shuttlecraft. One person. Open a channel. This is Lt Cmdr Data of the Enterprise. Koral. I take it that is your name? May I enquire as to your destination? No. May I ask the purpose of your journey? No. Perhaps I have not made our intentions clear... He seems most uncooperative. He may have been curt but he was also worried and a little scared. Sir, may I recommend that we bring the shuttlecraft aboard with our tractor beam, search it and interrogate Koral? According to the Klingon-Federation treaty, Koral has every right to free transit. We cannot search his vessel without cause. Yes, sir. However, the treaty does give us the right to conduct health and safety inspections on any ship. Health and safety inspections?! I am not certain that using this clause to conduct a search would be consistent with the spirit of the treaty. Yes, sir. However, if Koral wishes to contest our actions, he can file a protest with the Advocate General's office. Bring the shuttle aboard. Then you and Dr Crusher begin inspection. Aye, sir. Hello. I'm Dr Crusher and this is Lt Worf. We're here to conduct a health and safety inspection of your ship. Health and safety inspection?! That's right. You know, radiation leaks, biochemical contamination, other health hazards. Excuse me. No radiation so far. I'm sure you're glad to hear that! Right. There's an incoming message from the Klingon shuttle. It was sent 15 minutes ago. He's at the rendezvous coordinates. He's been detained by the Enterprise. He's stopped transmitting. The Enterprise! How did they find out about the rendezvous, Commander? Quiet! All that matters is that the Enterprise has the second artefact. We have no choice. We'll have to board the Enterprise. Do you have any idea how many security officers there are on board a ship like that? No, I don't. But he does. I could get us on the Enterprise. I can find the artefact. Very convenient. We beam you back aboard your old ship and then you change your mind and betray us. I have saved your life twice already, Galen! I thought you'd begin to show some gratitude by now! Galen, if you're so worried about Riker, you can go on the raid and watch him. Agreed. Draw weapons and equipment for a raiding party of five. If you're thinking of betraying us to your friends on the Enterprise, you might remember that I still have the ability to kill you. I haven't forgotten. I have an additional task, one that will prove your loyalty. This raid is an opportunity to get rid of Galen. Once you've found that artefact, kill him. I'm sure the inspection won't last much longer. I'm really glad we've had this opportunity to get to know you. May I ask what business you're in? Lt Worf has programmed our replicators to make a very good approximation of Klingon bloodwine. I believe you will find it to your liking. That's my third scan and I haven't found anything. He must be hiding something. We should analyse his computer memory. I can't defend that as part of a safety inspection. We could claim that the computer was generating abnormal radiation. We're on shaky ground as it is. We can't just... Don't! Watch that door! What is going on? Shut your mouth, Klingon! Surprised to see me? You could say that. I've had a change of profession. It's not in here. You! Where's the artefact? What are you talking about? They wouldn't be searching the shuttle if they had it. Koral must have it. Where is that Klingon pilot? In the observation lounge, with Data and Troi. How far? 12 decks away. Security will not allow you to get that far. They won't get the chance. The shuttle transporter will beam us in. Sorry about this. Let's go! If you could tell us something about the nature of your mission... What is this? Quiet! Does he have it? This is it! Are you sure, Galen? Yes, I recognise the inscription pattern from the first artefact. Cmdr Riker, by taking this action, you risk charges of assault, theft, piracy and treason. Really? Then I guess one more charge wouldn't hurt. Is he dead? Yes. Good. Activate the transporter. Security alert. Medical team to the observation lounge. Bridge, raise shields. Begin sensor sweeps for the mercenary ship. He's alright. He's only stunned. I must admit, I am experiencing a similar sensation. This is gonna take a little time to explain. Set course, 310, mark 215. Warp six. Where is it? I have something else for you. Tell him what happened, Narik. Riker turned on us. He tried to kill Galen before we beamed back. He might have killed all of us. He was acting under your orders, Baran. You betrayed us. This has gone far enough. I think it is time that we had a new commander, who'll lead us to those profits we've been promised. Really? And who would that be, Galen? You? He's plotted this all along, opposed me at every turn... ...endangered all of us by refusing to follow his orders. Follow your orders? The orders of a small man trying to fill a role too big for him. I say it's time for a change! Who's with me? It's over. Not quite. As long as I have this, I'm still Captain of this ship. You can't kill all of us. You need us to run the ship more than we need you to command it. I don't have to kill you all. Just you, Galen. What happened? I switched the transponder codes. Given his feelings about me, it seemed a sensible thing to do. Baran was nothing. We have a mission to complete and the crew needs a leader. There will be no more punishment on board this ship. Do your duties, and I'll see to it that we complete our mission and get our payment. Remove that. Orders? Maintain our present course and speed for now. I'll find out when and where we're supposed to deliver our cargo. Aye, Captain. Worf to Cmdr Riker. Minister Satok of Vulcan Security is standing by on a secure channel. Put it through in here. Greetings, Commander. How may I be of service? The mercenary ship that has been raiding planets in the Taugan system is headed for Vulcan right now. I do not understand. I'm sorry. It's been a difficult few days. One of your operatives is on a mercenary ship investigating the reassembly of a psionic resonator. I didn't want anyone firing at them. Commander, I believe there is a problem. We have no operative aboard a mercenary ship. We are to deliver the pieces to the T'Karath Sanctuary on Vulcan. I know that place. It was an underground stronghold for a faction in the last civil war. It's been abandoned for centuries. Galen to bridge. Alter course for Vulcan. Understood. Could you help me with something? I have translated most of the writings on these two pieces. Mostly, they're warnings of death and destruction to anyone who opposes the resonator, but I am not able to determine what appears on the anterior side. For example, this symbol represents the god of war, and this, the god of death, but if you look really carefully, you can see a third symbol is missing. Now, that obviously should belong to the final piece. What's odd is that the god of death and war would typically always stand alone on an artefact, not be combined with a third glyph. Fascinating. But I am not an archaeological expert. I'm anxious to see the final artefact. It might provide a valuable insight into Vulcan mythology. When we arrive at Vulcan, I will take the pieces to a secure holding area before going on to the sanctuary. I prefer to go alone. It will arouse less suspicion on the part of the isolationists. There should be no problem entering orbit. I asked Cmdr Riker to contact the Vulcan authorities and let them know that we were approaching. Why did you do that? I didn't want to risk a misunderstanding. Someone might have mistaken this for an actual raid. It was a wise precaution. Perhaps I should contact the Enterprise, have them meet us at Vulcan in case these isolationists try to escape. Your offer is appreciated. But our security forces are adequate. I see. Do you think it's wise for you to go there alone? After all, they were expecting Baran. If I were to accompany you, it might seem more plausible. Captain, I do understand your human emotional need to be there at the final moment. But this is a Vulcan matter. Of course. Thank you. We have entered the orbit of Vulcan. Tallera, I've decided on a change of plan. Leave one of the artefacts here. When we're paid in full, we'll complete the delivery. That was not the agreement. I realise that. But it's safer for us all to leave one behind. They will not pay us until they get both pieces. They've been waiting too long to take any risks. Take one artefact and beam down. That is all I was waiting for. Go to the navigational computer and check file 137/Omega. There's a message secretly transmitted to the Enterprise containing our flight plan. She's right. The message was sent by Galen. He's a Starfleet officer. Tallera is right. But what she's not telling you is that those artefacts she's holding are part of an incredibly powerful weapon. There's no reward waiting for you on the surface. As soon as she's got those artefacts, she'll leave you behind to be captured. I don't care what you want, Tallera. I don't care if that's a weapon for your personal use or if you're really just making a delivery. I want my money. So I propose a compromise. Narik and I will go with you to guarantee that we're paid. After that, you can go anywhere you want. Agreed. Bring him as well. He'll be our hostage if Starfleet arrives. If not, we'll kill him. There. Your reward, as promised. Is it all there? No, it's less than half what we were promised. Where's the rest of it? That is all I could manage. Take it and leave. I did not come this far to be cheated. I want it all now! Very well. You will get what you deserve. Go ahead, Captain. Pick up the phaser. See what good it will do. You won't get away with this. Starfleet won't let you tear apart a founding world of the Federation. How little you understand what you're facing. You're used to enemies like yourself. People on ships with defence shields, energy weapons, warp drives. But this is unlike anything you've ever faced. This is the power of the mind. Pick up the phaser, Captain. Listen to me, all of you. Drop your weapons. Do it! Don't make any aggressive movements. The resonator amplifies violent feelings and emotions. That's why you wanted me to pick up the phaser. That's how you killed Narik and Vekor. But I can see the symbol on that third artefact. And it is the Vulcan symbol for peace, standing between the symbols for war and death. It's a warning that the resonator can be overcome by peace. You are about to see how wrong you are. Empty your minds of violent thoughts. No! Think. 2,000 years ago, your people were consumed by war. But when peace came to Vulcan, the resonator became useless. That's why it was dismantled. You were right. The resonator cannot be stopped by phasers and shields, but it can be defeated by peace. Captain's log, stardate 47169.2. Security Minister Satok has taken Tallera into custody and begun a search for the other isolationists. Once we realised that you were not on the ship, we scanned the surface for your neural implant. We tracked you into the caverns. What will become of the resonator? Satok said all three pieces will be destroyed. It is unfortunate it cannot be studied. It is a key artefact from a remarkable period. Normally, I'd be the first to agree, but perhaps some things are best left in the past. What about the mercenaries? They'll be detained by the Vulcans. But they also face charges from the Klingons, Cardassians, the Ferengi and seven other worlds. We won't hear from them soon. Number One, set a course for Starbase 227. I'll be on the bridge. Wait. You've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. If we are to adhere to the exact letter of Starfleet regulations, then you have been declared a renegade. I believe you face 12 counts of court-martial offences. You cannot give orders either, sir. That's quite right. As I am supposed to be dead, I'll go and get some sleep. Mr Data, I suggest you escort Cmdr Riker to the brig. Aye, sir. This way, sir. Data, he was joking. You know that, right? Data! "
S7E06,"Data, we need to install that plasma conduit. We're bringing the new warp core on line. I will go to deck 20. I'll meet you in Engineering. This ought to be a lot of fun. Excuse me. Do you have authorisation to work in this area? You are dismantling a warp-plasma conduit. I must ask you to stop. Be quiet. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 47225.7. Cmdr La Forge has completed the installation of our new warp core. We are preparing to test its capabilities. Something wrong, sir? I've just got a message from Starfleet Command. Bad news? You could say that. I've been invited to the annual Starfleet Admirals' Banquet. My condolences. I managed to avoid it for six years, but now my luck has run out. I can't think of anything more tedious. 50 admirals shaking hands, making dull conversation, uninteresting food, boring speeches. Can't you think of some excuse? After six years, Number One, I don't think I have any excuses left. Geordi, have you ever had a nightmare? Yeah, sure, everybody does from time to time. I have had 111 dreams since I discovered this program nine months ago. In all that time, I have never experienced such disturbing imagery. I believe it was a nightmare. Nightmares are part of dreaming. Maybe you've discovered another level to your program. Perhaps. I note I am spending an inordinate amount of time thinking about nightmare imagery. One could almost say I am preoccupied. It's normal. Sometimes, after a nightmare, I can't shake that weird feeling for days. Cmdr La Forge. Speaking of nightmares. I've recalibrated the EPS module. That's great, Ensign. Thank you. Just like you said. Reset the power tap and the module came on line. You have a wonderful grasp of engineering principles. I'm learning so much just being around you. I'll tell you what. Help Farrell check out the deuterium cartridges. I'm bringing the warp core on line. Anything you say. You do not seem to appreciate Ensign Tyler's enthusiasm. Yeah, she's enthusiastic, alright. About me. I do not understand. She's got a crush on me, Data. You do not share her affection? Exactly, and frankly, it's beginning to get a little bit uncomfortable. I believe I understand. You are concerned about unintentionally hurting her feelings. Yeah, something like that. It would appear that you require a third party to intervene. I will speak to her. No, Data! I'll take care of it myself. Thanks. Geordi, when I first awoke from my nightmare, there was a moment... Bridge to Cmdr La Forge. What's our status? We're ready to bring the new core on line, Captain. Alright. Let's do it. Initialising deuterium-infusion sequence. It's a thing of beauty. Isn't it? Now let's see how fast she can run. La Forge to bridge. Warp power at your discretion. Acknowledged. Ensign Gates, set course for Starbase 219, warp six. Engage. Bridge to Engineering. Why isn't my ship moving? I'm on it, Captain. There's a warp-plasma conduit out of alignment. But I think I've got it fixed now. Ready, sir. Very well. Ensign Gates. Mr La Forge? Stand by, Captain. Captain, I am taking the warp-coil engines off line. La Forge to bridge. Sorry, sir. We'll have to refigure this plasma conduit. It's gonna take at least a couple of hours. Enter. Hello, Data. Counsellor. What are you doing? I have been watching Spot sleep. In 15 minutes, he has had 12 muscle spasms. He was dreaming. I have often wondered what Spot dreams about. His twitching and rapid breathing would seem to suggest anxiety. But Spot has never seen a mouse or any form of Rodentia. He has never encountered an insect or been chased by a canine. I understand you've had some interesting dreams recently. Geordi was worried. He wanted me to check how you were doing. That was thoughtful of him. I have debated whether to initiate another dream sequence. Because of the nightmares? I have found them to be quite unsettling. Data, you shouldn't be afraid of dark imagery in your dreams. It's a natural expression of your unconscious, if you have one. I'm not sure how your positronic brain works, but if it's like ours, then a part of you is trying to express itself through dreams. You should allow yourself to experience it. As Sigmund Freud said, dreams are the royal road to the knowledge of the mind. Thank you, Counsellor. I will initiate a dream program now. Let me know how it goes. Goodnight, Data. Goodnight, Counsellor. Goodnight, Spot. Computer, dim lights. Delicious. What cake are you eating? It is a cellular peptide cake with mint frosting. Would you like a bite? No, thank you. Excuse me, Mr Worf. Aren't you going to answer that? Sir? That damned ringing. Answer it. Yes, sir. Please identify yourselves. I must ask... Be quiet. Please, don't hurt me, Data. I am sorry, Counsellor. No! Don't. No. Data! Data. What is wrong? We've been trying to wake you. When you didn't show up, I got worried. My internal chronometer was supposed to wake me 35 minutes ago. You must have overslept. That is not possible. Something is wrong. I can't find anything wrong with your internal timebase. Your primary systems are fine. I will compare my logs with the ship's chronometer. Perhaps we have overlooked something. You know, there's a lot we don't know about your dream program. Maybe it was designed to cause side effects. For all we know, Dr Soong might have intended you to oversleep. It's part of the human experience. It is a possibility. But I want to make sure there are no anomalies in my neural nets. You know, I'm curious. What were you dreaming about? I have not fully assimilated its impact. I would prefer to study the images before discussing them. Sounds like it must have been strange. Strange is not a sufficient adjective to describe the experience. Tell me more about this cake. It is difficult to explain. Counsellor Troi's body was a cake. Her upper body. Describe the knife you used to cut the Counsellor. It had a black handle and serrated blade. And it was quite long. How long? 25 centimetres in length. And what happened next? One of the workmen pointed to her right shoulder. At that moment, I had an overwhelming urge to cut a piece out. And did you? Yes. As I began slicing the cake, she reacted as though I was causing her pain. Yet I could not stop cutting. That is when I woke up. Dr Freud, I am curious... I am curious. What do my nightmares mean? I believe you are experiencing a classic dismemberment dream. Or, in your case, being a mechanical man, a dismantlement dream. I do not understand. Your mechanistic qualities are trying to reassert themselves over your human tendencies. Ego and id, struggling for domination. The workmen symbolise the ever-present id constantly working to destroy the ego. The image of Counsellor Troi, a female, is devoured by you, clearly indicating an unconscious desire to possess your own mother. But I do not have a mother. Do not interrupt. The knife, in its violent connotation, suggests a certain feeling of sexual inadequacy. But I have no sexual desire. Impotence on top of everything! It is all becoming clear to me now. There might be a paper in this. I do not believe I am being helped by this session. Classic transference. Your anger towards me is, in fact, the animosity you feel towards your father. You are a polymorphously perverse individual, Mr Data, and I recommend full psychoanalysis. I believe I can fit you in next Tuesday. That will not be necessary. Computer, end program. Captain, incoming message from Admiral Nakamura. On screen. Admiral. Captain. We were expecting you this morning. Is there a problem? Actually, we have been experiencing a few difficulties with our new warp core but my chief engineer assures me we'll be under way within the hour. You're not trying to avoid this engagement, are you? No, no. Certainly not. I'm really looking forward to it. Good. I'll expect you soon. Nakamura out. I think he's on to you, sir. La Forge to bridge. Go ahead. We've just started up. All systems are holding steady. Ready when you are. Ensign Gates. Set a course and engage. Engineering, report. The warp field has collapsed, sir. It looks like we've blown the entire power converter. Impulse engines are down, too. We're not going anywhere. But I know how to fix this. Two, three hours, tops. Talk about going nowhere fast. Mr Worf, open a channel to Starbase 219. Advise Admiral Nakamura I'll be a little later than I thought. Aye, sir. Tyler, how is the relay diagnostic? Almost done, sir. Excuse me, I need the plasma inverter. Ensign Tyler still has a crush on you. You did not speak to her. Data, I haven't had the time. Listen, take this brace coil and run a metallurgical scan. See if there are any microfractures. Something wrong? I am reminded of a recent dream. This brace is reminiscent of... Are you going to answer that, Commander? What are you waiting for? Answer it. Hello? Kill them. You must kill them all, before it's too late. Data. What's wrong? I do not know. Everything seems to remind me of the nightmare. Objects, sounds, smells... Now I have seen elements of the dream in a waking state. I cannot explain it. Data, if you were a human patient, I might be concerned right now. I'd say you'd had a waking dream or a hallucination. But you're not human. I think it might be a technological problem. I have run three complete self-diagnostics. All of my systems are functioning normally. Perhaps Dr Freud was correct. The knife embodies my unconscious desire to inflict violence. Data, even Freud said, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. But the bottom line is, you're developing an obsessive interest in your inner workings. I'd almost call it the beginnings of a neurosis. That is not possible. Why not? You've eliminated all the technical explanations. It makes sense that as your neural net becomes more complex, more human, you might experience the same psychological complexities as a human. Do you really think so? Data, you must be the first person in my office excited at the prospect of a new neurosis. But, yes, it is possible. I'd like to start counselling you regularly. Daily? No, we'll start weekly. As a first step, I'd like you to shut down your dream program, just to be safe. Give yourself a chance to reflect on this experience. Thank you, Counsellor. I look forward to our next meeting. Data. Next time, see me before you see Sigmund. Admiral, I can explain... Let me guess. Your new warp core is malfunctioning again? Unfortunately, the problem has affected our impulse systems. At the moment, we are adrift. Are you expecting to fix this soon, or shall we send a tow ship to bring you in? That is not necessary. I have confidence in my engineers. I will be at the banquet on time. Picard out. Have you reconfigured the plasma conduits? Yes, Captain. Two hours ago. What about the relays? Are you certain you don't need a new phase inverter? I am running a level-three diagnostic. We will have the results in ten minutes. I see. Perhaps I could refigure these isolinear chips. No, sir, please don't touch that. Captain, Cmdr Data and I have the situation under control. If you let us take care of it, it would go faster. Captain, we could use an extra hand moving the containment pods. If it wouldn't be an imposition. No, I'd be delighted. Good work, Tyler. I thought he'd never leave. Data, give me a hand with this plasma conduit... Data? Deck 36. Hello, Data. Are you alright? What are you doing? Hold very still, Counsellor. No! Ever since you gave Alexander that music, he's been playing it all night, every night. I just wanted to broaden his horizons. He likes it. It is screeching, pounding dissonance. It is not music. Worf, it's better than music, it's jazz. Medical emergency, deck 17. We're on our way. I believe I had another waking dream, sir. But this time, I had an uncontrollable urge to eliminate the image. And what you saw was some sort of mouth on Troi's shoulder? Yes, sir. For a reason I cannot explain, I had the need to destroy it. Did you see a mouth on my head as well? No. I saw a straw coming from your head. A straw? As I said before, these are all images I experienced in my dream program. I do not have a rational explanation. Mr La Forge? We've run every possible diagnostic on Data's positronic net. We can't find anything wrong. I could run a subpolymer scan but it would take time. Make it so. In the meantime, Mr Data, I'll have to relieve you of duty and confine you to your quarters. A sensible precaution, sir. Data. Deanna, you're in sickbay. It's alright. Data... He's not here. Try to relax. This pad healed the wound but you've lost a lot of blood. I would like you to lie still. That's odd. There shouldn't be any discoloration after treatment. This looks like a rash. What is it? I'm picking up cellular degradation. But it doesn't appear to be related to the lacerations. There's also some kind of residual interphasic signature. Nurse. Bring me an interphasic scanner. I want a closer look at this. Commander. I will have to confiscate your side arm. Of course. May I ask a personal favour? Yes. Will you take care of Spot for me? Your animal? I am afraid if I have another waking dream, I might injure him. Of course. Spot, come here. Unlike a canine, Spot does not respond to verbal commands. Goodbye, Spot. He will need to be fed once a day. Feline supplement number 25. I understand. And he will require water. And provide him with a sandbox. And you must talk to him. Tell him he is a pretty cat. And a good cat. I will feed him. Perhaps that will be enough. Captain, we have a problem. Look at this. Her tissue is breaking down on a cellular level. It's spreading. At first, I thought it was a rash from the coil brace. But when I used the interphasic scanner, I found this. What is it? The question is, what are they? I've tested all the medical staff. I found them on almost everyone so far. The cellular decay is accelerating in all cases. I haven't found a way to stop it or even slow it down. Looks like you're infected, too. The organisms are attached to our epidermal layers with osmotic tendrils. They tap directly into the bloodstream. And from what I can tell, they're spreading. What are we dealing with? Are these creatures feeding on us? Yes, in a very particular way. They extract our cellular peptides. It's analogous to the way leeches consume haemoglobin. If they're not removed soon, our bodies will lose their cellular cohesion. We'll collapse into nothing but a few pounds of chemicals. Alright. Is there any way that we can affect these organisms? We've tried EM radiation, subspace fields, thermal protons, nothing's worked. They seem to exist in some interphasic state just beyond our visual and sensor acuity. We can only see them with an IP scanner. Tricorders can't see them. Do we know where they came from? I scanned the vicinity. There was no sign of similar creatures or any unusual interphasic activity. What about Mr Data? There must be some connection with his odd behaviour. Is he infested as well? I scanned him but I found nothing. Data attacked Troi because he saw a mouth on her shoulder. It was in that same area that we first saw one of the organisms. Data saw a straw in my head. Beverly discovered an organism there. Those images are all part of Data's dream. Maybe somehow he's unconsciously perceiving these creatures. Perhaps it is time we took a closer look at Mr Data's dreams. It is an interesting hypothesis. If I am being affected by these interphasic creatures, it may also explain my waking dreams and my antisocial behaviour. We want to link your neural net to the holodeck and activate your dream program. As you dream, we can observe the dream images. Perhaps we can learn about these creatures by interpreting your dreams. I see. The concept is similar to directed dreaming. Exactly. How soon can you have the link ready? We need an hour to establish the parameters. Make it so. In the meantime, Mr Data, I suggest that you prepare for bed. I think we're ready, Captain. The link is active. The holodeck has been calibrated to Data's neural net. Ready, Mr Data? Yes, sir. Normally, I would wish you pleasant dreams. But in this case, bad dreams would be more helpful. I understand, sir. Initiating dream program. Stand by. Let's be very observant. Even the most insignificant image could be important. Right. Here he comes. Hello. Can we speak to Data, or would that wake him up? He perceives us as part of his dream. Anything we say will be taken in that context. That sounds like a telephone ringer but I don't see a receiver. Cake? Thank you. Look at that. Her right shoulder. That's where Data stabbed her. In his waking dream, there was a mouth on her shoulder. They are both symbols of consumption. Mouth, food. Mr Data, what cake is this? It is a cellular peptide cake. With mint frosting. Cellular peptides. That's what the creatures are extracting. Will someone answer that damn ringing? Captain, the ringing is getting worse. What could the ringing symbolise? A bell. A sound. An old-fashioned way of communicating? Do you want some? It's delicious. Will someone please get that? Yes? It's for you. Picard. Kill them. Kill who? Kill them, before it's too late. Who is this? I am Dr Sigmund Freud. How does he fit into all this? If I were to interpret my own appearance in this dream, I would say I am the symbolic representation of Data's unconscious mind trying to warn him about the dangers he perceives around him. The interphasic organisms? Of course. Tell me, how do we kill them? Answer it. Nein. Do not be so literal. When I say answer it, I mean respond to it, to them. Be quiet. What do they represent? I don't know. But I do recognise that junction they're working on. It's the plasma conduit we installed with the new warp core. Respond? Respond to them? What does that mean? What is it that you're doing? Go away. Leave us alone. Who are you? We are... ...your enemies. Stop. You must not hurt my friends. Be quiet. Data, the shrieking noise you made causes them pain. Be quiet. I believe I understand. Geordi. Yes, Data? Adjust my positronic subprocessor to emit an interphasic pulse. Data, what's going on? The workmen represent the organisms trying to demolish this ship. The incessant ringing of the telephone, Dr Freud's cautions, were warnings of the dangers. What about the shrieking noises? My subprocessor detected interphasic signatures from the organisms, which were symbolically represented by a high shriek. When you made those noises, the workmen reacted in pain. That is why I asked Geordi to adjust my subprocessor. If I can produce an interphasic pulse, it may affect the creatures. We're ready. Picard to sickbay. Beverly, we're going to sweep the ship with an IP pulse. Will you monitor the creatures? Understood. It's working. Captain's log, supplemental. The creatures infesting the Enterprise have been eliminated. We believe the infestation originated within the warp core we obtained on Starbase 84. This conduit was made on Thanatos Vll using an interphasic fusion process. That process attracted the organisms to the conduit, where they lay dormant in the warp core. The core wouldn't go on line because they disrupted the plasma flow. How long before warp power? We have to manufacture a new conduit. That's six hours' work. Six hours? The banquet will be over by then. Very unfortunate. I can speed things up a bit. No. I wouldn't want to sacrifice the safety of the ship. Understood, sir. Enter. Counsellor. I did not have a chance to apologise. Data, don't worry about it. Geordi explained everything to me. It wasn't your fault. But somehow, I thought turnabout would be fair play, so I made us a little something to snack on. I wonder... What would Dr Freud say about the symbolism of devouring oneself? Data, sometimes a cake is just a cake. "
S7E07,"Captain's log, stardate 47254.1. A delegation of the Cairn have come on board. This telepathic species has no concept of spoken language. And is being instructed in its use by an old friend. I don't know what they'd have done! First I had to learn how they communicate. An exhausting process. It must be. Different from Betazed telepathy. We transmit words. With the Cairn, it's images, a flood of them all at the same time. It's overwhelming! I can imagine. Actually, it's very efficient. If two Cairn had this conversation, it would have been over minutes ago. Really? They know they'll need to communicate verbally if they join the Federation. Do me a favour. Introduce yourself to one of them. Have a conversation. They need the practice. I'd be happy to. It's called a visor. It enables me to see. Like my vocal enhancer. It helps me make sounds. I see you've already met my star pupil. Hedril's picked up spoken language faster than the others. Children often learn languages more easily than adults. Deanna was good at languages when she was little. Where is she? Well, she must be here somewhere. Hedril, darling, I... What? Go find your father, dear. I want to talk to him. Mrs Troi? I'm just a little tired. This constant telepathy with the Cairn... I'm fine, really. Aren't you going to mingle, Mr Woof? I do not care for telepaths. They make me uneasy. Don't worry. The Cairn couldn't read your thoughts even if they wanted to. Your brain isn't sophisticated enough. Neither is yours, dear. They could only communicate with other telepaths. Have either of you seen Deanna? She was working, but said she would be... Speak of the devil. Sorry, I lost track of time. Deanna, come with me. I want you to meet the senior diplomat of the Cairn delegation. Maques, this is the beautiful daughter I told you about, Deanna. Pleased to... Hello. Hello. Pleased to meet you. Ah, yes. That is it. Pleased to meet you, Deanna. Good. I'll just let you young people chat. Well, Maques, what do you think of the Enterprise? It is beautiful. Comfortable, also. I'm glad you think so. There is another word that describes it. But I cannot remember. You've learned a lot in a very short time. It won't be long before your words do justice to your thoughts. Your mother told me of your need. Need? A moment. Husband. You need a husband. I need a wife. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Deanna! Good morning. So, what did you think of Maques? Why did you do that? You embarrassed both of us. He's really very sweet. And lonely, poor man. A widower, raising a child alone. Mother, don't start. It's time for you to settle down. If your father were alive, I'm sure he'd say the same thing. Deck eight. But you'll do exactly what you want. Just like always. Mother, stop it! Are you coming? What's wrong? You are so precious to me. You're all I've got. If something happened to you, what would I do? Nothing's going to happen to me. You'd better go. My first appointment isn't for a few minutes. Let's talk. No, I'm fine. I'm tired from working with the Cairn. It's making me emotional. Are you sure? Go on. I'll see you later. Go on. Maques. I must apologise for yesterday. You don't have to. My words, they were confused. It wasn't your fault. Please. My mother misled you. Not in everything. She has an image of you... ...in her mind. She shared it with me. You are even more beautiful. The way my people communicate, it is direct. Nothing is hidden. Yes? Your mother is the first to learn our telepathy. You've never had telepathy with someone who wasn't Cairn? No. To communicate with her is very different. In what way? Always there is a part of her that... A part of her that is dark. Dark? A part of her that cannot be seen. Do you understand? I'm not sure. Have you asked my mother about this? She called it... A moment. ...privacy. Of course. You said, among the Cairn, nothing is hidden. We value honesty, but we don't always share everything we think and feel. This is privacy? Yes. It is normal? For us, yes. If this is your way... ...I am relieved. It is our ""way"". I will leave now. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm glad to have stopped also. I was all set for another argument, but suddenly she just fell apart. She's under stress. She's preparing the Cairn to meet the Federation. It's more than that. I'm sensing some very erratic emotions from her. Even her clothes are unusual. They're so subdued. Maybe you need to talk with her. Commander! Take your hands off her! Mrs Troi... Don't ""Mrs Troi"" me! Leave her alone. If it weren't for you, she'd be married by now. That's enough! I am warning you! Stay away from my daughter! You're coming with me. I don't know what got into me. Please, tell Will how sorry I am. You're fine. But your psilosynine levels are low. Psilo what? It's a neurotransmitter involved in telepathy. It's been depleted by your work. You have to avoid telepathy for a while. I can't. Why? We only have three days left and the Cairn have so much to learn. Lwaxana, I'm sorry, but you have to take some time and rest. Maybe I can help with the Cairn. No. You're only half Betazoid, dear. And you have no experience with their form of telepathy. Then I won't use telepathy. We'll work verbally. I suppose we could do that. And if they don't understand, I'll explain telepathically. No. You'll work verbally, too. The point is for you to get some rest, Mother. It'll do them good to figure things out with words. I suppose you're right. This is the ship's arboretum. ""Arbor"" means tree. Very good, Hedril. People come here to relax, enjoy themselves in a natural setting. ""Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose."" It's an old Earth poem by John Milton. Please, what is a poem? Poetry is an art form that uses words put together in new and unexpected ways, sometimes in rhyme. Milton was speculating that, in heaven, roses wouldn't have thorns. Heaven? Heaven is... Well, it's... How can I put it? Yes, I see. Thank you. Heaven. You're supposed to be avoiding telepathy. I'm only trying to help, dear. You don't look well. I'm just tired. Maybe I'll sit down. Don't worry. She'll be fine. You'll find this interesting. It's a jewel plant from Folnar III. The plant secretes a resin which is collected in the blossom. By the time the bloom fades, the resin has hardened into a beautiful gem. Mother! Troi to sickbay. Medical emergency in the arboretum. She's not responding to cortical stimulation. I'm not sure what else I can do. I don't understand. She was fine yesterday. It's so strange. It's almost as if her brain has shut down. Is there a physiological cause? I'm running a subneural scan. I can see no tissue damage, no neurochemical imbalance, no infection, nothing. Yet her neural activity is almost non-existent. Except in the paracortex. Activity there is almost off the scale. The paracortex is the Betazoid telepathic lobe. She communicated with Maques just before she fell. Might there be side effects of Cairn telepathy we're unaware of? It's a possibility. I think it's time that you and I had a talk with Maques. I am very apologetic for what has happened to your mother. Is it possible that your telepathic communications with Mrs Troi harmed her in some way? No. I tried to to explain before. Bad thoughts, they hurt her. What thoughts? Take your time. Inside her, the dark place. I don't understand. She is... What are the words? I don't have the words. Counsellor? Stop it! It's alright. I'm fine. He was just trying to communicate with me telepathically. Do you understand now? I'm not sure. He communicated so much to me that, at first, it was just a jumble. Have you sorted any of it out? I think so. During telepathic contact with my mother, Maques sensed what he calls ""a dark place"". He tried to tell me about it before, in my office, and I misunderstood. I thought he was talking about thoughts my mother was keeping private, but he meant something was happening in her metaconscious mind. Metaconscious? It's part of the Betazoid psyche, a filtering mechanism that protects us from psychic trauma. Is Maques suggesting your mother's metaconscious is damaged? He feels that whatever is wrong with her is centred there. If he's right, she may have suffered a trauma that her metaconscious can't tolerate. Has she mentioned anything traumatic that happened to her lately? No, nothing. Maques could be wrong about this. There's a chance a subneural scan might pinpoint a physiological cause for her condition, something I might be able to treat. The results won't be in until morning. We should all try and get some rest. I'd like to stay here with her. I'm going to try and contact her telepathically. Alright. Mother, can you hear me? Please come back to me. Please. Help me. Mother? Help me! How? How can I help you? Tell me, Mother. Please! Computer, lights. What are you doing?! Maques, what were you doing in sickbay? Helping. Trying to help Lwaxana. How? What were you trying to do? I was... She was... You, Deanna. Maybe you. Yes? You must... How can I explain? Tell me telepathically. Maques believes my mother's psyche has collapsed in on itself, that she has retreated into her metaconscious mind. Was he trying to contact her? Yes. He was able to access images generated by her metaconscious but could make no sense of them. I did not understand. He saw faces he didn't know and events he couldn't interpret. If we can decipher the images, we might be able to determine if her condition was trauma induced. Maques feels he can provide a telepathic bridge, so I can access my mother's metaconscious. If he can, I may find out what happened to her. If you succeed, can you use that to help your mother? I'm not sure, but I do know part of her wants to be helped. When I tried to contact her, I heard a voice calling out to me. If her psyche has collapsed in on itself, could accessing her mind pose any danger to you? There's no way to know. I'd like to try. I'll be monitoring her throughout the procedure. If anything goes wrong, Maques can break the telepathic link. Your mother, part of her is very frightened. She may resist you. I understand. Help me! Mother? Help me! Counsellor? Can you hear me? Captain? Dr Crusher's concerned that your paracortical readings are erratic. Are you talking from sickbay? Yes. Sever your connection to your mother. Why don't you ask Maques to do it? I'm asking you. That is an order, Counsellor. You're not Capt Picard. Leave me alone, please. This isn't real. None of this is real. Deanna! Daddy? Look at you! You've become a beautiful woman. Don't do this. I'm sorry I had to go away when you were so little. I didn't want to. You're not my father. You're part of my mother's mind. What is this place? This is our house near Lake EI'nar on Betazed. We used to live here. Deanna, let's not waste this chance. I want to hear everything about you. Did I live here? For a while when you were a baby. You were such a beautiful baby. Your mother and I loved you so much. I don't remember these toys. I bet you don't remember me singing you to sleep at night, but I did. I do remember. I always felt safe when you sang to me. There was one song you always asked me to sing. You couldn't sleep unless you heard it. Down in the Valley. Yes. Down in the valley Valley so low Hang your head over Hear the wind blow No, you're just trying to keep me here. Keep me from finding something. Your mother doesn't want to see you. I have to help her. If you want to help her, leave. Let her have peace. She called out to me. She does want me to help. Stay with me, just a little while. Deanna, it's been so long. We'll never have this chance again. Goodbye, Daddy. Hedril. Mother. Get away from her! No! I asked your father to bring you here because I want to talk to you. You know Lwaxana's sick, don't you? Yes. Is it my fault? No. Not at all. But I believe she's been thinking about you. Do you know why? I make her sad. Why do you say that? Because it's true. Do you have any idea why Hedril would make my mother sad? No. Well, thank you for talking to us. I'll see you later. Counsellor, I hope your mother gets better. Thank you, Hedril. So do I. I just don't understand how she fits into all this. I haven't found a physiological problem with your mother. Maybe Maques was right. Your mother's condition was precipitated by a traumatic event. Could this event have involved Hedril? I doubt it. My mother never mentioned her. Does your mother keep personal logs or a journal? Yes, she does. I'll contact Mr Homn on Betazed and ask him to transmit a copy. There may be some clues there. Perhaps we are being too literal. I have learned in my study of dream analysis that people who appear in a dream can represent aspects of the person dreaming. That's right. A child might represent vulnerability. Hedril may depict a fragile part of my mother. A part that she's protecting. You said everything you encountered in her mind was some kind of barrier. Yes. You, the wolf, my father. It was as though she were summoning all her defences to keep me away. But keep me away from what? What is she protecting? Come in. Counsellor. Hello, Captain. I've just come from sickbay. Dr Crusher feels that your mother's condition is worsening. Her neural foundations are getting weaker. Have you had any luck here? No, nothing. I went through her belongings, read her journal for the last five years. Other than the fact that I'm not married yet, nothing bad seems to have happened. Is this your father? Yes. He had a kind face. I remember when he died, my mother had to go through all his things and pack them away. I was seven. I remember thinking how mad he'd be when he saw what she'd done. I didn't understand he wasn't coming back. Your mother might still come out of this. If we can't figure out what's wrong with her, Captain, I don't think she will. But I don't know what else to do. I've talked with Mr Homn, who's known her for years. I've checked her medical records, I've made inquiries to the government on Betazed, I've contacted her closest friends. If she's been through a psychic trauma, there's no evidence of it. You reviewed her journals for the past five years. Maybe we should go further back. That's a lot to review. She's kept a journal since before she married. Then let's start at the beginning. First entry is stardate 30620.1. That's the year they were married. That's odd. There's a seven-year gap. It starts about a year after the wedding. If I'm not mistaken, it ends a few months after your birth. She's so diligent about her journal. Why would she stop making entries? She didn't. The files were deleted, by your mother, almost 30 years ago. I don't understand any of this. Captain, I have to go back inside my mother's mind. It's the only way we'll ever get any answers. Thank you. Deanna, you understand if your paracortical readings get too high, I'm going to tell Maques to sever the connection. I know. Hedril, be careful! Who is Hedril? Wait! I want to talk to you! Help me! Help me! Go. Mother? Go away. No. I want to help you. Why did you delete parts of your journal? Did something happen you don't want me to know about? Leave me alone, please! Who's Hedril, Mother? Why is she here? Is Hedril me as a little girl? No. I'd never let anything happen to you. Never. Did you let something happen to someone? Was it here at EI'nar? You were just a baby. Tell me. Whatever it is, we can face it together. I can't. You can. We can. Help me. Help me, Pappa. Here. Please don't make me go through this again. Hold on. Don't let him run off. I won't. Mommy, can we play by the water? No, Kestra, stay here with us. Please? Kestra! You've made the baby cry. No, don't cry, Deanna. Don't cry. Mommy's here. Mommy, please? No, Kestra. We're going to eat. What's wrong, little one? Tell Mommy what's wrong. lan, she's teething. Now, where's her ring? No. I don't want to see this again. I can't! What happened, Mother? What happened next? I don't remember. You have to. You can't hold it back. It's killing you. The dog got away. She ran after him. We didn't notice. Why? Why did I look away? Why wasn't I paying attention? You have to forgive yourself, Mother. You have to let it go. How can I? I let her die! It was a tragedy, the worst thing that can happen to any parent. I know you feel responsible, but it was an accident. And what you're doing isn't fair to Kestra. I saw a little girl who was sweet and happy. She must have brought a great deal of joy to your lives. Every morning, she woke up with a smile. Isn't it better to remember her like that? I just found out I had a sister I never knew. I'd like to learn what was good and joyous about her. To celebrate her life, not mourn it. How? How can I do that? Kestra was here a few moments ago. Talk to her. No. No. Do it, Mother. Tell her how you feel. I'll be here with you. I'll help you. Mommy! Kestra! My precious one. I'm so sorry! I have to go now. I know. I remember the day I took this. Mr Homn said he saved it in case someday you wanted to remember her. I wish you could have known her, Deanna. I wish you two could have grown up together. Tell me about her. I want to know everything. "
S7E08,"Captain's log, stardate 47304.2. The Enterprise has arrived at Kesprytt III in order to evaluate an unusual request on the part of the Kes for associate membership in the Federation. This morning, she was 15 minutes late. That's the third time this week. Jean-Luc, you don't have any idea what I'm talking about. No. I'm really sorry, I don't. I've been talking about Nurse Ogawa and Ensign Markson for 15 minutes. You have? I'm really sorry. Are you worried about this mission? Not worried exactly. This notion of admitting half their planet while leaving half out. First of all, the Kes are not half the planet, they're nearly three quarters. The Prytt are not being left out. They simply don't want contact with anyone from the outside. Every member of the Federation entered as a unified world. That unity said something about them. They had resolved certain social and political differences and they were ready to become part of a larger community. By all indications, the Kes are a very progressive people. But the Prytt not. They are reclusive to the point of xenophobia. Think about Earth. What if an old nation state, say, Australia, had decided not to join the World Government in 2150. Would that have disqualified us as a member? That analogy is not... Riker to Captain. Go ahead. Ambassador Mauric is ready to see you and Dr Crusher. Inform him we're on our way. Thank you for breakfast. Wait until tomorrow. I have something special planned. It's a Vulcan dish. That's all I'll say. Captain, Doctor. I have the coordinates of Mauric's chambers. Let's not keep them waiting. Enterprise to Kes Security Relay Station One. We are ready to commence transport. Acknowledged. We have lowered our shield. Confirmed. Energise. This is Security Relay Station One. We are ready to receive your captain and medical officer. This is the Enterprise. We have completed the sequence. You should have them. Negative, Enterprise. They are not here. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Beverly. What happened? I don't know. The last thing I remember, we were beginning to transport. I assume we must be on Kesprytt. We're in some kind of prison cell. The question is, why? I can't imagine Ambassador Mauric would have reason to detain us. Jean-Luc. What? Let me see. What? It looks like an implant. Seems to be connected directly to the brain stem. Some kind of coercive device? Whatever it is, I doubt it's for our health. What is going on here? If you tell us why we're hostages... You're not hostages. You are prisoners. Prisoners on whose authority? You're being held by the Prytt Security Ministry. The charge is conspiring with the enemy. Enemy? The Kes? We're not fools. We are aware of the attempted alliance with the Kes. It will not be tolerated. Your information is incorrect. We have no plans... There is no point in trying to mislead us. The devices in your cerebral cortexes will soon be calibrated to your psi-wave pattern. At that time, we will get the information we need. Then you'll discover we're telling the truth. We shall see. Nothing is wrong with the transporter. I have run a complete diagnostic of all the components. Then what happened? Commander, the transporter sensor log shows a concentration of antigraviton particles in the emitter coil. A concentration of antigraviton particles suggests a tractor beam. It might have deflected the beam to a different set of coordinates. Is there a way to locate them? The tractor beam originated in the Prytt alliance. What does the Prytt want? I don't know. It won't be easy to find out. The Prytt have consistently refused all outside contact. We'll have to work through the Kes. Contact Ambassador Mauric. Tell him I want a meeting. What? What? You're staring at me. I was thinking about how to get out. There may be a structural flaw. Right. The important thing during any confinement is to think positively. There is a way out of every box, a solution to every puzzle. Damn! Well, at least this means we won't starve to death. It means they plan on keeping us. I'm beginning to think negatively. My tricorder. Does it work? Yes. Except something's been added to the main directory. It's a map. An escape route. That guard must work for the Kes. Possibly. Or it could be part of a carefully laid trap. If you ask me, I'd like to take my chances. Agreed. Is there a way to open the cell door? Yes, the code's been entered. Commander, on behalf of my government, I would like to present my profound apologies regarding this incident. That's very kind. But no one holds you or the Kes government responsible. Our concern is not to assign blame but to recover our officers. I agree. We are prepared to insert a hostage-rescue team on three hours' notice. We have not attempted a diplomatic effort yet. I won't use force before trying other options. I don't believe there is any diplomatic option. We have no formal relations with the Prytt, no ambassadors, simply no way to contact them. Surely you must have in the case of a planetary emergency. We have never had the need. We can find their communications frequency and establish a link. Allow me to be blunt. The Prytt are fanatical xenophobes with little regard for discourse. Even if you establish communication, it will be a waste of time. How long has it been since your last diplomatic contact? Almost a century. It's possible they have changed. We have had other, less formal contacts with the Prytt. Contacts we cannot discuss. I can assure you, they have changed very little. With all due respect, Ambassador, I should try to communicate before I sanction the use of force. Of course, Commander. In the meantime, I will prepare for a rescue mission. Agreed. I do have one request. We believe the Prytt obtained the information about the transport through a breach of our communications network. If I could establish a base on the Enterprise... ...l'd feel more secure. Mr Worf will help you. Thank you, Lieutenant. You first. Is there a problem, Ambassador? Probably not. Simply securing the area. I assure you, there is no need. I'm sure you're right. Yes, this will do very nicely. As Security Chief of the Enterprise, I would be glad to assist you. There's no need. We'll do everything. Thank you, Lieutenant. There must be a lava flow or an underground hot spring. It's a lava flow. It's 30 metres below us. It says we should go this way. I smell gas. This whole chamber is filled with a methanogenic compound. Can we get through it? I think so. What? I didn't say anything. There might be a pattern to the eruptions. We can navigate our way. Say when. Now. The eruptions have stopped. Gas is building up. I have scanned the Prytt communication system. This appears to be the access module for their government. Can you tell which link is to the Prime Minister's office? Yes. But the Prytt have no link for extraterritorial communication. Our hail may come as a surprise. They're going to have to adjust. Open a channel. Prime Minister Horath's headquarters. Can I be of service? This is Cmdr William T Riker of the Starship Enterprise. The Enterprise? You mean the ship in orbit? That's right. Why are you on this commlink? We're having trouble contacting your government directly. Did you get authorisation from the Security Ministry? We're having trouble... I cannot participate in an unauthorised communication. This transmission is terminated. Not very friendly, are they? No, sir. Sir, we are being hailed. It is the Prytt Security Council. It looks like we got someone's attention. On screen. Enterprise, this is Security Minister Lorin. You will cease all attempts at communication. We have been attempting to contact your government. You have detained two of our officers. We want to discuss that. There is nothing to discuss. If you do not terminate these transmissions, we will take aggressive action against your ship. Their weapons pose no threat to us. Just the same, keep the shields up for the time being. Is there a problem, Commander? Our effort ran into a wall. I'm sorry. Perhaps this will brighten your spirits. We have freed your captain and doctor. What? They were being held in a prison. But one of our operatives arranged their escape. Where are they? En route to the border. Our operative provided them with a map on where to go. How will they cross the border? That information is confidential, but trust us, we do have a plan. I must insist that you provide us with more information. I understand your concern. But I would feel more comfortable discussing operational details in a less public environment. Certainly, in the ready room. I'd prefer my quarters. They're safer. Alright. There's no way out of here. Maybe we took a wrong turn. So am I. What? I'm thirsty, too. I didn't say anything. I heard you. You said, ""I'm very thirsty."" I was thinking it, but I didn't say anything. You were thinking it? The transceivers. Lorin said they would align to our psi-wave patterns. The implants must be transmitting our thoughts. What am I thinking? I don't know. I can't hear your thoughts either. Maybe it was a fluke. Right now, we have more immediate concerns. Does your map show a way out? Yes, we need to go up. There's a ledge about 30 metres up. That should lead to a tunnel to the surface. Right. I heard that. They're not words exactly. A sudden sense of fear. A sense of fear of heights. So much for a fluke. It was a strange sensation. Suddenly having thoughts appear in my mind. If you sensed a fear of heights, you sensed accurately. Come on, you've done this before. It's like on a holodeck. One step at a time, just climbing steadily and slowly. Right. I see you've redecorated. Just a few pieces of equipment necessary for security reasons. You understand? Certainly. He is alright. How do you plan to get our people out of Prytt territory? You must realise that everything I say cannot leave this room. For some time, we have had certain friends among the Prytt, citizens who realise that the struggle between us can only end when the Prytt government is made to see reason. You've recruited Prytt spies. A crude but accurate term. These friends are waiting for your captain and doctor at Ohn-Kor, near the Kes border. The map will take them to a tavern there. Forgive me, but is it wise to send two human fugitives in Starfleet uniforms into a Prytt village? The danger is minimal. Our operatives control the village. Once contact is made with Capt Picard and Dr Crusher, our friends will escort them across the border into Kes. I would feel better if they rendezvous in a less public place. We know what we're doing. We've had a lot of experience of dealing with the Prytt. We'd hardly risk the safety of your people. After all, we hope you will recommend our entrance into the Federation. One of us is hungry. That would be me. Do you mind thinking something else? What do you want? Not a bowl of vegetable soup. My grandmother made it. Peas, carrots... Beverly! I'm sorry. I am not being unreasonable. I didn't say you were. I thought it, but that's different. You're right. We can't react to every thought in the other's mind. Isn't it astonishing, the clutter in our consciousness? Odd memories coming to the surface. Remembered songs. Stray daydreams, scattered minutiae. I wonder how true telepaths sift through it. How can they get through if the mind churns all this flotsam to the surface? That is not funny. I was seeing if you were listening. I think our link is getting stronger. Maybe some distance might weaken it. Not that I'm tired of hearing your thoughts. Certainly not. Jean-Luc. What happened? I was suddenly overcome with a wave of nausea. Me, too. There's nothing wrong with either of us. Maybe the air is toxic. Same thing. When you moved back to me, it got better. Well, it seems as if we're stuck with each other. What is it? I'm not sure whether we should go over this hill or that one. The map is a little vague. Let me see. This way. You don't really know, do you? What? You're acting like you know, but you're only guessing. Do you do this all the time? No, but there are times when it is necessary for a captain to give the appearance of confidence. I'm sorry, I just couldn't resist. You always seem to have some acerbic remark on the tip of your tongue. At least I've trained myself not to say it. When I was a girl, my mouth got me in trouble with my parents, teachers. Your friends. There was someone called Tom Norris. Right. One date I brought to a halt with, ""Is that a beard..."" ""...or is your face dirty?"" There's more. You're laughing, but you're embarrassed by that incident. Yes. I thought I was being cute but I really hurt him. That was a long time ago. I learned a valuable lesson. This sharing of thoughts and feelings is quite compelling. Very. We'd better get going. I don't think so, either. Maybe we can find another way to the village. No. It's several kilometres around that ridge. The border is just two kilometres east of here. There's a force field protecting it but we can deal with that. Come on. Alright. Something wrong? Have a seat. Capt Picard and Dr Crusher did not show up at the rendezvous point. Do you know what happened? No. We have no idea. We find it strange that your officers should follow the escape plan and then fail to make the crucial rendezvous. Maybe they have been recaptured. Our sources would have informed us if that happened. Of course, if they weren't captured, if they made a different rendezvous, we might not know about it. A different rendezvous? I don't know what you mean. Of course not. How could you know if your captain and doctor were meeting the Prytt? Meeting to set up an alliance with the Federation. What? It's a clever scheme. First, you pretend to lose officers during transport, then you ask us for help and get us to expose our operatives. But you didn't expect us to get your people out so quickly. They needed more time to plot the destruction of the Kes. This is ridiculous. You're seeing conspiracies everywhere. We were invited by the Kes. Why would we ally with the Prytt? Indeed, why? Believe what you like. We'll find our people with or without your help. Then it is time for us to leave the Enterprise. Fine. Make sure you take all this junk with you. No luck? I'm beginning to think there's not a single thing to eat. Well, by this time tomorrow, we could be on the Enterprise and you can sit in front of a replicator with a knife and fork. Remember that Vulcan dish I promised for breakfast? I was... You hate having breakfast with me. That's not true. Yes, it is. When I said breakfast, you said, ""I hate that."" That's not what I meant. What did you mean? It's just that I don't like... What I've chosen for breakfast recently. I think breakfast should be a simple meal. Recently, you've been ordering elaborate things. Coffee and croissants, that's all you want. Why didn't you say so? I didn't think it was important. You don't like elaborate meals either. No. I prefer something simple myself, but I thought you enjoyed variety. Well, it's coffee and croissants for both of us from now on. I love firelight. There's something about the flame, the smell of the smoke. It's always seemed to me to be intoxicating, somehow. I remember when Jack and I took Wesley camping to Balfour Lake. Wesley kept throwing manta leaves into the fire, watching them pop. Jack kept telling him... What? Jean-Luc, I heard you. Don't push it away. When I said, ""Jack and I,"" I felt this sudden wave of something. I didn't know you felt that way. Didn't you? I guess I always knew that there was... ...an attraction between us right from the start, but I never knew how strongly you felt. Why didn't you tell me you were in love with me? You were married to my best friend. At first, I thought it was harmless infatuation. Something hormonal rather than emotional. Then when the months went by and we spent more time together... I realised that it was something else, and it wasn't right. But although I would never act on it, I couldn't help the way I felt. And when Jack died, you felt guilty. I felt guilty before he died. Having feelings like that for my best friend's wife, and then later, after the accident... ...I promised myself that I would never tell you how I felt. It would be like betraying my friend. That's why you didn't want me on the Enterprise seven years ago. I didn't know how I would react. And then, little by little, I realised that I... I didn't have those feelings any more. 20 years is, after all, a long time. And now we're friends. Yes, friends. Well... We still have a lot of ground to cover tomorrow. We should get some sleep. Right. Ambassador, thank you for coming. Commander. We're going to clear up this misunderstanding. Hail Minister Lorin. Aye, sir. I have warned you about unauthorised communications. Yes, I know, but it's time we sat down and worked this out. I have Ambassador Mauric here... Your misfortune. We have nothing to say to either of you. You're working with the Prytt. Putting on this show does no good. We'll see. Mr Worf. There's someone waiting for us in the observation lounge. I should have known you were capable of such an outrage. I'm sorry, Minister, but you left me little choice. Don't pretend the two of you are enemies. If you're hiding your military alliance, you needn't bother. I know more than you can imagine. Let's all sit down and find out about Capt Picard and Dr Crusher. I will not sit at a table with him. No more than I would sit with her. Alright, then, we'll stand. The important thing is we talk. I am not authorised to talk with a Kes. Alright, then, talk to me. Where are my officers? As if you don't know. Let's go. I'm alright. We know of your plan to use Federation technology to build attack satellites. You will find we are prepared. A pointless lie. I'd rather discuss your plan to take over Kolrod Island. We've been over this before. Kolrod belongs to the Prytt... That's it. I can see diplomacy won't get us anywhere today. I do not have time to negotiate. Let's put our cards on the table. You're concerned the Kes will be admitted to the Federation. Correct. As First Officer of the Enterprise, that won't happen. The Kes will be denied membership. You have no authority to make that decision. Despite whatever games you played, we'll still take our petition to the Federation Council. They'll listen. They'll also listen to our report. I can tell you now, the First Officer's report will go like this. ""Kesprytt, a deeply troubled world."" ""Social, political and military problems that they have to resolve."" ""The Kes, while a friendly and democratic people, are driven by suspicion, deviousness and paranoia."" ""It is my opinion that they are not ready for membership."" Now... The matter of our missing officers. They are charged with spying. I have heard nothing to alter that. Then consider this. If anything happens to them, Starfleet will want an investigation, which means more starships will come, and those ships will want answers, which puts your country under a large and uncomfortable microscope. Remember how unhappy you were when we contacted one of your people? Think what it would be like. Ten starships, contacting hundreds of your people. Massive sensor sweeps. They may even send down away teams. All because you wouldn't help me find my missing officers. I think I can use the tricorder as a multiphase pulse. That should weaken the force field enough. No, the modulation frequency is in the upper harmonic range. They're coming. I'm working as fast as I can. Minister, we have the human female. The male is in Kes territory. Very well. Transmit their coordinates to the Enterprise. Understood. Thank you, Minister. Now, if you'll excuse me. Mauric will protest to the Federation Council. He won't get far. I tend to agree, Number One. Did I miss something? Of course. You're absolutely right. That was wonderful. My pleasure. Don't get me wrong, but I'm glad we're not joined any longer. Were you getting tired of my company? Just tired of bumping into you every 30 seconds. I was beginning to feel you were part of my uniform. To freedom. Freedom. Penny for your thoughts. I was just thinking that as distracting as it was, I was beginning to get used to hearing your thoughts and I find that I miss it. So do I. It was very intimate. You know, last night, I couldn't sleep. I was awake for several hours. And thanks to the implants... ...I got to hear some very interesting dreams of yours. A man is not responsible for what his mind does while he's asleep. What about when he's awake? Now that we've had this unique experience, what do we do? What do you mean? You know exactly what I mean. No, I don't. The implants have been removed, remember? Now that we know how each of us feels, perhaps we should not be afraid to explore those feelings. Or perhaps we should be afraid. I think I should be going now. Goodnight. Goodnight. "
S7E09,"Geordi? In here, Data. Got her now. She's trapped. Come on out of there. Don't you spit at me! Why is Spot under the bed? Probably because she knows if I catch her, I'll kill her. Has Spot misbehaved? So far, she's broken a vase, a teapot, she's ruined a chair, using it as a scratch post. And she's coughing up hairballs. These incidents are common to cat owners. You borrowed Spot to experience feline behaviour before getting a cat yourself. Well, I'm not ready. You can take her back with my blessings. Go ahead, call her. Spot does not respond to commands. She doesn't come when you call her? Data, have you ever considered training this cat? I never found it necessary. The cat is out of control. I didn't know if she was going to lick me or scratch me. I have never experienced this kind of behaviour in Spot. Although she does jump on my console when I am working. She needs training. Riker to senior staff, report to the observation lounge in ten minutes. We have to get her out. I'll scare her. You grab her when she comes out. It would not be wise to startle her. Training. Definitely. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 47310.2. We're investigating the disappearance of the medical transport Fleming, somewhere in the Hekaras Corridor. Our search is complicated by the unique properties of this region. The Fleming was last in contact four days ago. They reported nothing strange. Data. The sector's dense tetryon field poses a severe hazard to warp-driven vessels. The Hekaras Corridor is the only route in this sector free of tetryon fields. Ships travelling at warp must use it to ensure safe passage. How long will a level-one search take? At least two days. The Corridor is over 12 light years long. Tetryon interference will limit our sensor range. Could we use reconnaissance probes? Ineffective. Interference would disrupt contact with the probes. But we can increase sensor efficiency. We've installed multiphase buffers on all the sensor modules. Hekaras II is inhabited. Maybe they've had contact with the Fleming. The Hekaran government says only one ship passed through the system. A Ferengi trader. The Fleming was carrying rare and valuable biomimetic gel. Maybe the Ferengi hijacked it. I think we should prepare for that contingency. I agree. Mr Worf, initiate your search pattern. Let's head in. Geordi, there has been a slight drop in sensor efficiency. We should examine the phase buffers. I'll be right with you. Hanson, transfer the EPS conduit 13 to the stabiliser matrix. Aye, sir. Is there a problem with the engines? No. Then why stabilise the EPS conduit? To get higher power conversion. That would not affect the engines. I know. That's not the point. What is the point? I'm just trying to get a higher conversion level. Why? You know the Intrepid? Their chief engineer is Cmdr Donald Kaplan. We were at the Academy together. I like to make sure that our levels are a little bit higher than theirs. I understand. You are in competition with Mr Kaplan. You might say that. This is the flagship. We should be better. You are trying to outperform the Intrepid. Actually, it's more personal pride. These are my engines. And there's nothing wrong with a little friendly rivalry. OK. Computer, how much have the conversion levels increased? Levels are unchanged. I'll deal with this later. Let me give you a hand with those sensors. How's that? One moment. The phase buffer is operating within normal parameters. Sensor efficiency has increased by 6.7 percent. 6.7. One of the stages must still be out of alignment. Let's try junction A-9. Geordi, I have taken your suggestion regarding Spot. Coming down. I have begun training her. Really? Yes. I am studying several new techniques. I used conditioned response, then environmental enhancement. Next, I will explore bioconditioning devices. Devices? Sensor nets for behaviour modification. Or biofeedback motivators. Unfortunately, I have been less than successful. I've got an idea. How about a phaser? A low stun setting at the right moment might do it. Geordi, I cannot stun my cat. I was kidding. Let's see what we've got. No, this isn't it either. There is a misalignment somewhere. That's for sure. We've got one more possibility. Junction C-12. I am concerned that my training efforts will fail. Maybe you're doing it wrong. I have consulted numerous animal-training manuals. Some claim that cats are inherently untrainable. I don't believe that. My sister knew nothing about animals and she trained her cat. How complicated could it be? What did she train her cat to do? Jump into her arms on command. Interesting. I could use your sister's techniques to keep Spot from jumping on the console. How did she train her cat? She walked around for two months with a piece of tuna in her blouse. I was right. This buffer is out of alignment. OK. Try that. Phase alignment is stabilised. However, sensor efficiency has increased by only an additional 1.3 percent. Not much, but every little helps. Riker to Data. Data here. We're picking up a ship on long-range sensors If you and Geordi are finished, come to the bridge. We won't squeeze any more out of these. Acknowledged, sir. We are on our way. We are within visual range. On screen. It is a Ferengi transport ship, D'Kora-class. It's the same one that entered the Corridor a week ago. No plasma emissions. Their warp drive must be inactive. Their impulse system is down as well. Power generation is extremely low. What about life signs? Life-support systems are low. There are approximately 450 Ferengi on board. A standard complement. Mr Worf, open a hailing frequency. There is no response on any channel. No subspace emissions from the ship. Looks like all their field coils have been overloaded. That explains why they haven't responded. And their warp-drive failure. Ferengi sensors are still on line. If I modify a deflector emitter to transmit old-style delta waves, the Ferengi should be able to pick it up. Make it so. If they did hijack the Fleming, they didn't get very far with the cargo. Mr Worf, have tractor beams ready. We may have to tow them. Helm, take us within tractor range. Aye, sir. Captain, I am picking up power emissions. They are locking weapons! Shields up! Return fire. Target their weapons only. Phasers locked. Fire! Direct hit. Their weapons systems are down. Damage report. Minimal damage to decks five and seven. The Ferengi ship's power is stabilised. They have impulse capability. They were playing dead. Conserving power until we got close. But why would they attack us? I don't think we can beam over and ask them. Mr La Forge, how's that commlink? Almost ready, Captain. Let's give it a try. Open a channel. This is Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. Will you please explain why you attacked us? Our attack? We were defending ourselves. Do you deny that you were responsible for disabling my vessel? Your ship was adrift, your communications inoperable. We were attempting to assess your status. You were attempting to move in for the kill. Do not toy with me, Picard. We are obviously at your mercy, but know this. When the Ferengi Council learns of your actions, they will consider this an act of war. There has been some misunderstanding. It would be in all our interests if you came aboard to discuss it. I see no reason to trust you, human! In that case, we'll be on our way. I'll relay your position to your government if you wish, in case you are unable to complete your repairs and remain stranded. Perhaps it would be better to discuss the situation. We detected what appeared to be a Federation signal buoy. When we approached it, it emitted a massive verteron pulse. Our warp drive, sensors and communications were disabled. We assumed we were the victims of a new Federation weapon. The Federation established this corridor to ensure safe access through this sector. Why would we mine it? Whatever happened may not be an isolated incident. A Federation medical transport was lost there. We passed a Federation ship, but it was not in distress. What was its heading? It is possible that information was recorded in our sensor logs. Unfortunately, my entire crew is occupied with repairs. I don't think there is time to search our records. DaiMon, if we assigned an Engineering team to assist with your repairs, would that give you time to retrieve your logs? I believe it would, Captain. Spot. Spot, down. Down. This is down. Down is good. This is up. Up is no. One moment. Come in. Data, I had another idea about power conversion. Can you help? I would be happy to. Are you teaching Spot to use the console? It is part of her training programme. I am teaching her to jump down on my command. How's it going? I have not been entirely successful. Feline supplement number 221. Data, that cat definitely has a mind of her own. Maybe she's just not trainable. I must accept that possibility. Spot may lack the intelligence to learn responses to my commands. I don't know about Spot, but your training is coming along just fine. Come on. Let's go. Keep the EPS constant while I remodulate the power taps. This will only raise the conversion level by 0.8 percent. I know, but it could be enough. Enough? I've received this from Cmdr Kaplan, subspace. ""I got the Intrepid's power-conversion levels up to 97.1 percent."" ""Maybe you should try cleaning your plasma grid."" Can you believe his nerve? We perform maintenance regularly. I know. He's just trying to get me angry. There. That should do it. Computer, what are the current power-conversion levels? Power-conversion levels are at 97.2 percent. Too bad, Mr Kaplan. Captain's log, supplemental. We have traced the Fleming's course. She may have come to an unfortunate end. What's the origin of this debris? Unknown, sir. It does not appear in any chart. Could it be the Fleming's remains? It is a possibility. The debris consists of duranium and polycomposite fragments, which suggests a ship. There is sufficient mass to account for the Fleming. Let's take a closer look. Maybe we can get a more positive identification. Helm, take us through the debris field, ahead slow. I am picking up a small metallic object, 3.5 metres in diameter. A ship's-log recorder, or a probe casing. I do not believe so. It is emitting an unusual signal. Captain, it is generating a verteron field. Shields up! Full reverse! Now! Damage report. Warp engines are off line. Shields are down. All subspace systems are inoperative. Just like the Ferengi vessel. Unidentified ship heading toward us. Two life forms aboard. On screen. They are initiating their transporters. Can we get more power to the shields? No, sir. All decks, security alert. Captain, we are being boarded. La Forge to bridge. We have intruders in Engineering. We need a Security team. It's on its way. What do you want? We're trying to make you listen. You're killing us. It's a serious accusation. I want you to explain it. Our research shows that warp fields cause a dangerous reaction in this region. Our planet is being affected. There are large gravitational shifts in our system. If something isn't done, our planet will become uninhabitable. Their research was evaluated by the Federation Science Council. It didn't hold up. That research was preliminary and the analysis was incomplete. You should have made a request through the Science Council. With their resources it would have taken over a year before they come out here to evaluate our work. We couldn't wait any longer. We knew that if we disabled enough ships, Starfleet would come. Then we could present our case. You're rationalising these attacks? Neither you or the Ferengi suffered any casualties. Damage to vessels was negligible. We disperse verteron probes merely to disable warp-driven ships. Call it what you like. You disguised your probes. You hid them as signal markers in the debris field. You mined the Corridor! Mr La Forge, how long will it take to restore the engines? They overloaded our field coils. It'll take at least 36 hours. I know how our pulse affected your field coils. With my help, you could be operational in ten hours, provided you agree to review our research. Because of the seriousness of your claim, I will listen to your case. But our priority is the recovery of the Fleming. I expect you to help us restore our engines and deactivate the remaining probes. If you do not, you will both be taken to the nearest starbase, where you will answer charges. My sister and I do not wish to impede the rescue... Rabal, the probes are our leverage! Serova. We will do as you ask, Captain. But please, re-examine our data. We will. It is our job to retain an open mind, even under these circumstances. Take them to Engineering. Get the core on line. Yes, sir. Mr Data, review their research. I want your report as soon as possible. There. Shields have been restored. You can re-engage engines in approximately eight hours. Even when we get the engines on line, it will take a week to recalibrate them properly. I'm sorry you've been inconvenienced. But it's only an inconvenience. Our concerns are more important than your engines. If the Fleming had been on an emergency mission your plan might have cost lives. That didn't happen. And saving lives is what we're trying to do. In an interesting way. There's no point talking to you. You've already decided not to listen. I know my sister can be somewhat aggravating. I'd have to agree. Try to understand. She believes profoundly in this cause. She is dedicated to exposing the dangers of warp drive. Warp drive has been around for three centuries. It's a proven technology. You sound like I did, four years ago. You didn't believe her? No. I didn't realise how brilliant my sister is. It took two years for me to even grasp the principles of her theories. They're that sophisticated. Our Cmdr Data's no slouch. If there's anything there, he'll find it. I hope so. Once Starfleet stops warp travel through the Corridor, our own people will have to give up warp drive. Hekaras II is the only inhabited world in this region. Without warp drive you'd be completely isolated. Are you really willing to take that step? Yes. And if you were in my position, I hope you'd be willing to do the same thing. Serova and Rabal believe there are regions of subspace instability in the Corridor. If these regions continue to be exposed to warp-field energy, they will rupture. Subspace will extrude into normal space, forming a rift. Like walking on the same piece of carpet, wearing it out. That analogy is correct. Can this theory be proven? Not at this time. There is insufficient evidence. To determine whether a rift will form, a region must be exposed to energy one million times greater than that of a starship. We believe the effect is cumulative. Each starship that passes through at warp brings us closer to a rift. That is a possibility. I suggest we ask the Federation Science Council to send a research vessel. A more detailed investigation will resolve this. That's your response? More research. More delays. I shouldn't have expected any different. Bridge to Capt Picard. Go ahead. We've located the Fleming approximately 0.3 light years away. What's her condition? The vessel seems intact. They have shields. But their subspace systems are out. We'll be under way when our engines are on line. I would like you to put together a research proposal. I will give it my full recommendation. I appreciate the opportunity. It's a beginning we... Not ""we"". You can do whatever you want. I'll have no part of this. It's just another delay. Captain, the engines are back on line. Good. Helm, lay in a course for the Fleming. They're in pretty good condition. Shields are back. Captain, the Hekaran ship is moving off. There is one person on board. It is Serova. Doctor, what is going on? I don't know. Captain, may I speak to her? Mr Worf, open a channel. Serova, what are you doing? They wanted proof. I'm going to give it to them. I'm sorry. Captain, the Hekaran ship's engines are overloading. I believe Serova is trying to create a warp-core breach. No! Prepare for impact. Shields at maximum. Full reverse. Report. We have cleared the shockwave. However, tetryon flux is increasing rapidly. It's incredible! Mr Data, your analysis? The event is approximately 0.1 light years in diameter. It is emitting extremely high levels of tetryon radiation. It appears to be what was predicted. A subspace rift. She was right. Can you get a fix on the Fleming? Is she in one piece? Scanning. It is near its previous coordinates. It appears intact. But it is now within the rift. Doctor, could a ship survive in there? I'm sorry about your loss, but we need your help now. Of course, Captain. Does the rift pose any danger to the Fleming? I don't know. What was that? A high-energy distortion wave from within the rift. If we maintain our position, our shields should protect us. What about the Fleming? The waves are more intense in the rift. I estimate her shields will fail in approximately 12 hours. Can we risk going in? Not at warp. The rift is in a state of instability, which would make it sensitive to warp fields. We might expand it. I don't think we have a choice. It would take weeks at impulse. I want better options. Data, Geordi, take Dr Rabal to analyse the rift. We need to find a way to get the Fleming out. Second Officer's log, stardate 47312. 1. New sensor readings have improved our understanding of the rift. However, we have been unable to find any way to counteract it. Everything supports Serova's theories. I can't find any way to close the rift or reduce it. Doctor, is it possible there are stable areas inside the rift, where we can safely use warp engines? Perhaps. Computer, scan the rift for regions of low instability. There's no area stable enough to withstand a warp pulse. Wait a minute. This is strange. Computer, display grid Delta 17. Enhance and magnify. What do you make of that? It's a subspace instability outside the rift. That should not be possible. I'm going to begin a scan of this sector. I'd like to get a closer look at this. We should tell the Captain we don't know how to get to the Fleming. I am not certain that is true. I believe I have an idea. I suggest we coast into the rift. Coast? We can initiate a brief warp pulse from our current position. We should be able to attain the velocity to enter the rift, beam over the crew and exit, without using warp engines. If we initiate a full-power pulse, how long before we drop out of warp? If we field-saturate the nacelles, we should be able to stay in warp speed for two minutes. That doesn't give us long. It could get rough in there. Timing will be critical. Begin your calculations. We'll go as soon as you're ready. Aye, sir. I believe the maximum saturation level should be 18.3 percent. Alright. We should be able to maintain warp speed for two minutes, eight seconds. No more than that. I agree. But based on the size of the rift, that should give us sufficient time to complete the rescue. Computer, initiate nacelle field saturation. How did we miss it, Data? I beg your pardon? How did we miss the connection between warp drive and the formation of the rift? We've logged thousands of hours on these engines. We're supposed to be warp-field experts. We were wrong this time. Technically, we were not wrong. Serova's theories rested on unprovable assumptions. Seems to me she managed to prove them. By using methods any reputable scientist would never employ. Yeah. She was willing to die in order to make her point. We should have listened to her. We reviewed Serova's research to the best of our abilities. We were prepared to continue studying. But that was unsatisfactory. I can remember trying to get people to believe me without proof. You would not have resorted to such extremes. But she had to, just to get us to listen. Why was I so resistant? Her aggressive methods created an adversarial situation. Yeah. Maybe I was taking the whole thing personally. I do not understand. Maybe I was a little threatened. The thought that warp engines might be doing some kind of damage. It's going to take half an hour for the nacelles to saturate. Will you call me when they're done? Commander. May I join you? I'm sorry about your sister. Thank you. I'm trying to tell myself she died for what she believed in. But, somehow, that isn't much comfort. I wish it could have happened differently. I should have checked the research more closely. It's possible I missed something. No. You didn't miss anything. The problem was time. We needed more time to do the proper research. Serova wasn't willing to wait. Yeah. I guess the question is now, where do we go from here? We can't look at space travel the same way. We have to change. I've been in Starfleet a long time. We depend on warp drive. I don't know how easy it will be to change. It won't be easy at all. Warp-pulse calculations are complete. We will be firing the engines for 6.3 seconds before disengaging. Damage-control teams standing by. Course to the Fleming is plotted. Mr La Forge, whenever you're ready. Aye, sir. Initiating warp pulse now. Engines disengaged. We are now entering the rift. Hull stresses increasing. 83 percent of maximum tolerance and rising. When will we reach the Fleming? One minute, 22 seconds. Transporter rooms standing by. I'm picking up power emissions from the Fleming. They may be attempting to initiate their warp drive. They could have repaired their engines. Captain, if they activate... I know. Can we establish communication? There is too much interference. How long until we reach transporter range? 53 seconds. We're not going to make it. Captain, they have initiated warp drive. Report. Damage on decks six and 14. Our integrity field is holding. And the Fleming? Their life-support systems are failing. Transporter rooms, prepare evacuation procedures. Captain, when the Fleming activated their warp drive, the rift increased by 2.3 percent. We no longer have sufficient momentum to escape. Distortion-wave intensity has increased by a factor of ten. We are within transporter range of the Fleming. Commencing evacuation procedures. Distortion waves occurring every 59 seconds. Hull stress is nearing maximum tolerance. Can we force an EPS discharge through the impulse reactor? I do not believe so. The explosion would destroy the saucer section. Captain, we may not have to use warp engines. How, Geordi? When did you last go surfing? A distortion wave. Exactly. If we phase-match our shield to the EM variance of the distortion wave, the next one will pull us along with it. We could ride it through the rift then break away. If we survive the ride. Is everyone off the Fleming? The last of the crew has beamed aboard. Alright, Mr La Forge. Get us out of here. Yes, sir. Phase-matching the deflector shields now. The next wave will impact in 14 seconds. Matching phases. Prepare to engage the deflector shield on my mark. Ten seconds. And mark. Engage deflector shield, full power. We lost it. We were unable to maintain phase match. What went wrong? Speed differential was too high. Another distortion wave approaching. Impact in 26 seconds. We can't handle many more jolts like that. Captain, I suggest we take the ship to full impulse. It will lessen the impact of the wave. Helm, full impulse. Mr Worf, all power to structural-integrity fields. Aye, sir. Stand by deflector shield. We're ready. Impact in five seconds. Engage deflector shield now. We are within the distortion wave. Hull stresses have exceeded maximum. Structural-integrity fields failing, decks ten to 16. Switching to backups. We're separating from the distortion wave. I'm compensating. How long till we clear the rift? 12 seconds. Hull stresses 120 percent above tolerance. A structural breach is imminent. We have cleared the rift, sir. Hull stress has returned to normal. Cancel red alert. Captain's log, stardate 47314.5. We have been continuing research while the Federation studies our preliminary reports on the rift. It appears certain that what we've seen here will have repercussions for many years. Our scans show a lot of subspace instability. If exposed to warp energies, they could create other rifts. Dr Rabal? Based on current patterns, we've projected where subspace rifts are likely to form over the next 40 years. This is how things are now. This is how they'll look in ten years. 20 years. 30 years. 40 years. Thank you, Doctor. Mr La Forge. We've received new directives from the Federation on this matter. ""Until we can counteract the warp-field effect, our best course is to slow the damage."" ""Areas susceptible to warp fields are restricted to essential travel."" ""All Federation vessels as of now are limited to a speed of warp five."" ""Except in case of extreme emergency."" The Klingons will observe that. The Romulans will not. And what about the Ferengi? And the Cardassians? The Federation's sharing our data with warp-capable species. We can only hope they realise it's in their own interests. Limiting warp speed will only prevent new rifts. What about this one? Right now there's not much we can do. The gravitational shifts are affecting my planet. Our climate is changing. The Federation will put a weather-control matrix on Hekaras II as a temporary solution. We're lucky the rift took place as far from the planet as it did. It gave us time. If there are no questions, you're dismissed. The thermal stabilisers for the Hekarans will be ready in a day. Very well. Geordi, I've spent the better part of my life exploring space. I've charted new worlds. I've met dozens of new species. I believe these were all valuable ends in themselves. Now, it seems that all this while, I was helping to damage the thing that I hold most dear. It won't turn out that way, Captain. We still have time to make it better. "
S7E10,"Captain's log, stardate 47410.2. The Atrean government has requested assistance in averting a natural disaster. Two geologists have come aboard. One is a human who has been living on Atrea IV. The situation has worsened since my husband and I contacted you. The molten core of our planet isn't just cooling, it's begun to solidify. Our gravitational field is affected. Seismic activity has increased by a factor of three. If the cooling continues at this rate, Atrea will become uninhabitable in 13 months. We could minimise seismic activity by creating isobaric fissures. That would be temporary. The only permanent solution is to reliquefy the core. These pockets in the magma layer, how close are they to the core? A few kilometres. Why? Data, is that close enough for ferroplasmic infusion? The procedure will involve using the ship's phasers to drill down through the planet's surface into the pockets where we would set up plasma-infusion units. We'll trigger the units by firing energy bursts through the shafts. I see. Injecting plasma directly into the core should trigger a chain reaction. That will reliquefy the magma. It should stabilise the core temperature at 93 percent of normal. If it works, the core would remain molten for centuries. If you give your permission, we could begin immediately. Very well. But I'd like to update our geological surveys. Fine. I'd be very happy to help you. We've assigned you quarters. Make yourselves comfortable. Thank you, Captain. Data. Yes, Doctor? Do you have any idea who I am? Dr Juliana Tainer. You've lost all your early memories. We thought you would, but we couldn't be certain. Have we met? Data, I was there, right at the beginning on Omicron Theta. I helped create you. Now look at you. You were a colleague of Dr Soong? I most certainly was. And I was also his wife. In a way, I suppose you could say I am your mother. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. I can't believe I'm seeing you after all these years. I have no memory of you. There's a reason for that. We wiped your processors after refining your programming. Why don't you tell me what you do remember? I'll fill in the gaps. My memory begins when I was activated by Starfleet officers on the Omicron Theta outpost. After the attack of the Crystalline Entity. All of the inhabitants of the colony were killed. However, I discovered that my memory contained their journals and logs. We hoped their experiences would be useful. After your childhood, we figured you could use all the help you could get. My childhood? That's what I called it. You were like a baby at first. A 100kg baby, but still... You had trouble learning your motor skills, learning how to process sensory information. Noonien was never satisfied. He kept tinkering, trying to make you as human as possible. So, you wiped my memory processors after this childhood? Then we deactivated you and programmed you with the colonists' logs. We had planned to reactivate you but we never got the chance. The Crystalline Entity attacked and we had to leave quickly. We wanted to take you, but there was only room for two in the pod. Doctor, I have scanned the journals of the colonists. There is only one Juliana mentioned. Her last name was O'Donnell. That's me. There was no mention that my father married you. Because of my mother. She thought Noonien was an eccentric scientist who was far too old for me. We decided to marry secretly so she'd get used to us being together. We slipped away to Mavala IV and got married there. A Klingon and a Corvallan trader were our witnesses. It wasn't the wedding I'd hoped for. But Noonien had a way of making the oddest things seem romantic. My father had an unusual way of looking at things. How would you know? I encountered him in the Terlina system. That's where we went after we left the outpost. I had no idea that you met him. Shortly before his death. He's dead? Yes. I had no idea it would hit me this hard. We didn't part on the best of terms. What do you mean? I realised he loved his work as much as he loved me. Maybe more. There we were, stuck on that planet in the middle of the jungle with no one to talk to. No life. It just wasn't enough. That's why I left. That was all a very long time ago. The important thing is that we're here now together. I do want to get to know you. This has been an interesting encounter. And an altogether unexpected one. I would like to corroborate your story before we proceed. Excuse me, Doctor. I'm almost finished. We can start drilling in an hour. Inform me when you are ready. What are you doing there? I am attempting to ascertain whether Dr Tainer's story is true. Don't you believe her? I neither believe nor doubt. I am simply trying to verify her assertions. What have you turned up so far? The Registrar's Office on Mavala IV cannot confirm the marriage. Many documents were lost when the government was overthrown. What's that? I am checking passenger manifests to see if they went to Mavala IV. O'Donnell, Juliana. Soong, Noonien. They were passengers on a transport which travelled to Mavala and returned four days later. That sure fits with her story. The fact that they went to Mavala does not prove they were married. You know, Data. It seems you're trying to prove Dr Tainer wasn't telling the truth. Not at all. I am unable to reconcile her story with the fact my father never mentioned her. She did leave him. Maybe she broke his heart. Maybe he didn't want to talk about her. Let me ask you this. Dr Soong created an emotion chip for you. Didn't Lore tell you that chip contained memories that Soong wanted you to have? Yes. It is possible those are memories of my childhood and of Mrs Soong. Think about it. Why would she want to lie? Why pretend to be your mother? I can think of no motive. I can understand that this might be disconcerting for you, Data. It came out of the blue. It doesn't fit into your logical processors. That is true. But that's life. Part of being human is learning how to deal with the unexpected. To risk new experiences even when they don't fit your preconceptions. I admit I find it difficult to accept the possibility of a past about which I know nothing. But it is also true that I am curious to learn more about it. Data? I would like to get to know you better, Mother. I wanted to make you female, but your father insisted on a son. We argued endlessly, right up until we were ready to assemble you. How did you decide? Noonien walked in with your head, and, innocent as you please, said it was up to me. He knew what he was doing. He had made it in his own image. What could I possibly say? Deanna Troi, is that who you're going to visit? Yes. Your father would be so pleased. Pleased? He was worried that the sexuality program wouldn't work. You misunderstand. Counsellor Troi is a therapist. Goodnight. We will be in position over the site in three minutes, 29 seconds. These scans indicate that the magma pockets are somewhat unstable. I'll monitor the density of the rock and adjust the particle beam. That should minimise the seismic stress that we generate. Data, I reconfigured the phasers to create a highly focused beam. Thank you, Geordi. I'm pleased you've got good manners. It wasn't easy to strike the right balance. At first, you couldn't care less about social niceties like please and thank you. You were downright rude, in fact. Data? That's hard to picture. That was nothing to the problems we encountered... Never mind. I don't want to embarrass you. I am incapable of embarrassment. Please continue. The one thing that we couldn't anticipate was that you didn't seem to mind about being naked. Some colonists objected to an anatomically correct android running round with no clothes on. We asked you to dress, but you didn't feel it was necessary because you didn't suffer from the elements. We had to write a subroutine to get you to keep your clothes on. Riker to Engineering. La Forge here. Go ahead. We've established an orbit over the drilling site. Phaser modifications are on line, sir. My calculations indicate the first blast will be 19 seconds in duration. Acknowledged. Someone has checked his calculations, of course? No, but Mr Data knows what he's doing. Even so, he is a machine. Someone should check up on him. I have confidence in Mr Data's ability to check up on himself. Mr Worf. Phasers locked on target. Fire when ready. We are within two kilometres of the magma pocket. Another five seconds should do it. We've broken through. Terminating the beam. The pocket seems stable. I detect no increase in the stress levels of the magma. Good work. I don't think it could have been cleaner. We have Data to thank for that. His figures were perfect. The drilling has increased the temperature by almost 300 degrees Celsius. It will be several hours before it cools enough for us to enter. Data, do you have any plans? I do not. Maybe we should spend a little time together. I'd love to see your quarters. Thank you. I will be playing this piece at a recital tomorrow. That was beautiful. I am told my playing is technically flawless but never beautiful. It was, really. Are you saying this because you are my mother? I notice that parents exaggerate their children's accomplishments. I suppose there's an amount of vanity involved, considering that giving you a creative aspect was my idea. Your father didn't really see the point. He thought that, without emotions, there would be no need for you to express yourself. Somehow, I had the feeling that the opposite would be true. I do not know for certain, but I believe it is during my creative endeavours that I come closest to experiencing what it must be like to be human. Well, I'm glad I insisted. As am I. Data. I am very familiar with that Handel piece. How would you feel about my playing the viola part tomorrow? I would like that very much. I'd have to practise. You don't have a viola? I could replicate one. Computer, please replicate one viola. Did you paint these? Yes. I am attempting to master all known styles of painting. This one is in the style of the French lmpressionists. It's very good. Who's this? That is Lal, my daughter. Your daughter? I created her, using myself as a model. Where is she now? The positronic matrix I designed was unstable. She only lived a short time. I see. In a sense, you were her grandmother. Would you like to practise now? Yes, of course. The acoustics in ten-forward are most favourable. Yes, very nice. Data, may I ask you something? Of course. Do you think you will ever try to create an android again? Perhaps. I created Lal because I wished to procreate. Despite what happened to her, I still have that wish. But how do you know the same thing won't happen? Creating a stable positron matrix is very tricky. Your father lost several prototypes before Lore. I was not aware he created others before my brother. There were three of them. They were like children to us. Losing them was very painful. When Noonien tried again, I was against it. I didn't think we had the right to bring a life into the world with so little chance of surviving. But your father was sure that he'd figured out what went wrong. He insisted he could make a stable matrix, and he did. But Lore was cruel. Evil. Eventually we had no choice. We had to dismantle him. Your father decided to build another android, who didn't have emotions. I couldn't believe he would want to try again. I am that android. Are you saying you were against my creation? Initially I was, but I was wrong, I know that now. I've followed your progress for years. I'm very proud of what you've accomplished. Then why did you never attempt to contact me? Because I felt guilty about something I'd done. Perhaps if you told me what that was, it would alleviate the guilt. I lied. When I said there was no room for you in the escape pod. There was. I didn't want to bring you with us. I was afraid if we reactivated you, you'd turn out like Lore. I made Noonien leave you behind. We are within four kilometres. We're picking up pulses along the beam. We must have hit magnesite ore. I'll adjust the phaser harmonics. Data, terminate the beam if this keeps up. If we do, we will need another suitable location. There is no other location. Just give me a few seconds. Doctor, it'll take longer than that to match the... You did it. It was just luck I hit the right frequency. We're less than two kilometres away from the target site. Stand by to terminate the beam. We've broken through. Now. I detect no signs of instability. Commander, set up the infusion unit in the first magma pocket and give this one a chance to cool. Data, transporter room two. Acknowledged. I have initialised the plasma coils. I need another minute to align the diverter. There are signs of stress in the surrounding magma. But the site should remain stable until we finish the infusion. Good. We're almost through here. Data. Juliana told me what she said last night. She's upset. I don't blame you for being angry. I am incapable of anger. It's alright, Pran. I know what I said was hard for you to hear. But I hope you understand my reasons. I am not certain I do. Perhaps you could clarify them. I'll try. What do you want to know? If I had been your biological offspring, would you have left me? Data. How can I answer that? Dr Tainer, I get the impression you are trying to spare my feelings. I assure you, that is not necessary. I don't want you to misunderstand my answer. No, I wouldn't have left you if you'd been biological. Do you place more value on biological life than artificial life? Absolutely not. I cherished every android your father and I created as if it were my child, even Lore. He turned on us and did dreadful things, but dismantling him was very difficult. I was afraid that if you were like him, I'd have to dismantle you, too. And I couldn't bear to do that. I'm not trying to justify leaving you behind. I'm just sorry I did. I hope you believe me. I do. Thank you for making it clear to me. Bravo. Why do you want Dr Tainer's records? Is something wrong with her? I was hoping you could determine that from her trace pattern. Probably I could. But I don't check medical status without a good reason. Doctor. I would ask that you not require me to be more specific. I assure you, I have a good reason for asking. Alright, Data. At first glance, I see nothing wrong. Except for mild hypertension, normal for a woman her age. I see. Maybe you should tell me what her symptoms are. She has not complained of discomfort. Then why do you want to see her medical records? Because I believe she is not who she claims to be. Bridge to Data. Go ahead, sir. There's been a cave-in. Go to transporter room two. On my way. Excuse me, Doctor. What happened? They were running a final check when part of a wall gave way. It looks like it has stabilised, but stress is building up. The pocket will collapse. How long, Geordi? Tough to tell. 12 hours at most. Then we must configure the unit and inject the plasma. I'd rather not send anyone down. If you don't, it may take months to find another suitable site. The core may solidify. We have to act now. Alright. I want you in and out quickly. Acknowledged. You're hurt. I'll go. There will be more seismic activity. We must hurry. The shaft has not been obstructed by seismic activity. It should be possible to trigger the unit from orbit. A fuse is damaged. We have to start programming all over again. Priming the energy-transfer matrix. Reinitialising the particle-stream buffer. Riker to Data. Are you there? Go ahead. We're reading an increase in seismic stress. Understood, sir. We will attempt to expedite our work. There. Now, we just have to realign the diverter. Data, are you alright? Yes, sir. We will return to the beam-out point shortly. That's it. Let's go. Can we transport without pattern enhancers? No, we are too far below the surface. How are we going to get down there? There are no handholds in the rock. We have to jump. No. It's too far. I won't make it. You will. Basically, she's a Soong-type android, except she's designed to fool you into thinking she's human. She has tear ducts, sweat glands, even veins and capillaries underneath her skin. Why does the scanner read her as human? Because she has a processor designed to send out a false signal. It's part of her ageing program. Not only does she age in appearance like Data, her vital signs change, too. What I can't figure out is why she lost consciousness. As far as I can see, everything is fine. She should be awake. Check her positronic matrix. There may be a cascade anomaly. You said you knew she was an android. How? The first indication was when we were digging. I saw her perform complex calculations without the computer. That could've meant she was good at math. True, but it was enough to get my attention. Later, I noticed something odd about the way she blinked. The intervals between blinks were governed by the Fourier system, the same formula my father used to give my blinking the appearance of randomness. Only you could have noticed that. Then the concert in ten-forward. What about it? We had practised the piece. She played it the same way during the performance. Every pitch, every intonation, was exactly the same. Only an artificial life form could have done that. Does her husband know? I do not believe so. He is on the surface monitoring the plasma infusion. Probably just as well. Data, come take a look at this. It appears to be an information module. With a holographic interface. Whoever you are, you must've found out about Juliana. That is correct. I programmed this hologram to answer any questions you might have. I am Noonien Soong. I created her. I am Data. Data? I hoped somehow it would be you. I even created a response program to answer your questions. How are you, boy? I am fine. I'm glad you got the chance to meet your mother. You refer to Dr Tainer as my mother. Yet the complexity of her design indicates she was created after me. You're right. But there was a real Juliana O'Donnell. She was my wife. She helped me create you. What happened to her? She was injured... ...when the Crystalline Entity attacked. We made it as far as Terlina III but... ...she slipped into a coma. When I realised nothing could be done for her, I built an android. I tried to perfect my synaptic scanning techniques so that I could transfer Juliana's memories into a positronic matrix. Didn't know if it would work but I had to try. I couldn't stand the thought of losing the only woman I ever loved. A few days after Juliana died, I activated the android. She looked up at me and smiled. She recognised me. It had worked! Here was a life, not two minutes old, and as far as she knew, I was her husband. She'd just recovered from a terrible injury. It was incredible. Then you never told her the truth? Why? There was no reason for her to know. I wanted her to be happy. I wanted us to be happy. We were. For a while. What happened? I made a terrible mistake. I never really let her know how much I loved her. So she left me. The real Juliana would have left, too, if she'd lived. If she recovers and learns she is an android... She doesn't have to know. I designed her to shut down in the event the truth was discovered. When you put that chip back in, she will wake up and remember nothing. All you have to do is make up some excuse about what happened. You do not believe she should know the truth? The truth? The truth is, in every way that matters... ...she is Juliana Soong. I programmed her to terminate after a long life. Let her live out her days, and die believing she was human. Don't rob her of that, son. Please. It seems that I must make a decision. Whether to tell Dr Tainer that she is an android or to withhold that information from her. I do not know what to do. Why was Dr Soong so adamant that she not be told? He seemed certain it would preclude her being happy. Data, what do you think? I am not certain. I understand why my father felt as he did but his wishes are not necessarily paramount. I am more concerned with what is best for her. Wouldn't she be better off knowing the truth? Dealing with the reality? I don't think so. She's believed she's human all her life. The truth might be devastating. There might come some time in the future when she would find out. Another accident, perhaps. Maybe it would be easier if she learned the truth from you. I can tell you that if I were in her place, I would rather be told by my son than by some stranger. I find I am having difficulty separating what would be best for her from what would be best for me. What do you mean? If she knew she were an android, we would have something to share. I would no longer be alone in the universe. I know how much that means to you, Data. But at the same time, by telling her, you're robbing her of the one thing you've wanted all your life. To be human. It's a difficult choice. Do what you think best, Data. Whatever decision you make, we will support it. Data. What happened? The last thing I remember was jumping off a cliff. You were knocked unconscious. You broke a bone in your arm, but Dr Crusher repaired it. Everything is fine. Captain's log, supplemental. The infusion into the core of Atrea IV has been accomplished. The core should remain molten for several hundred years. When will I see you again? Perhaps I can visit Atrea on my next leave. I would like that very much. Well, I'd better be going. There is something you should know. My father told me... ...that he had only one great love in his life and that he regretted never telling her how much he cared. I am certain he was referring to you. That's nice to know. On Atrea, there is a saying. ""A child born from parents who love each other will have nothing but goodness in his heart."" I guess that explains you. Take care of yourself, son. Goodbye, Mother. Energise. "
S7E11,"Personal log, stardate 47391.2. I am returning from the bat'leth competition on Forcas III. The conditions were difficult. Several contestants were maimed. But I was triumphant. I won champion standing. I am looking forward to resuming my duties aboard the Enterprise. However, I am anticipating a troubling situation. We'll have to go into the Argus Array. It's the third time this year it's stopped relaying data. Starfleet is beginning to think it's more than a simple malfunction. I want you to start a long-range scan... Lieutenant? Are you listening to me? Yes, sir. You seem awfully tense for a man who just came back from vacation. Today is my birthday. What's the matter with you? Because it is my birthday, I assumed that you or one of the others would try to mount an unexpected social gathering. A surprise party? Mr Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would never do that to you. I am sorry, Commander. I'll meet you on the bridge. Aye, sir. Surprise! I love surprise parties. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. That was not a Klingon song. It wasn't easy to translate. There isn't a Klingon word for ""jolly"". It's traditional for the birthday boy to cut the cake. Capt Picard sends birthday wishes. He's on the bridge. Happy birthday, Worf. Thank you. A painting. Yes. I have entered my Expressionist phase. This is my interpretation of the Battle of HarOs. The Battle of HarOs? I think it's wonderful. And I know just where to put it. What are you doing? This room could use more colour. Nice. The Battle of HarOs, right? Are you alright? Yes. I think Data's painting is making me dizzy. Some cake? Thank you, Doctor. I thought the cake was chocolate. Don't I wish? Alexander gave this to me before he left to visit your parents. Thank you. What is it, Worf? It's a cast of Alexander's forehead. The ridges of a warrior. He wished he could be here when you got back from shore leave. He stayed up all night talking about how proud he was of his father. Thank you for watching him. It was my pleasure. So, how old are you? Captain. I was told you could not attend. I wouldn't miss this for the world. How old are you? I am... ...old enough. Report. The array appears to be functioning normally. That can't be right. We were told the array stopped relaying data. The array is still transmitting data but is not sending it to the Federation. It appears someone has redirected its imaging systems. Where is the information being sent now? Sector 19658. I cannot access its main computer. It is impossible to determine its exact location. What's in that sector? It is uninhabited. But there could be a ship or a station receiving the data. Captain, I suggest we beam a repair team aboard. We could download their imaging logs, find out what they've been observing. Make it so. Mr Data? Excuse me. Do you have a moment? Of course. I have been meaning to speak with you about Alexander. It has never been easy for me having Alexander on board. I have tried to give him guidance, but he has his own mind about things. Most children do. I could not have come this far without you. Alexander looks up to you. At times, you are like a mother to him. That's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me. One time when I thought I was going to die, I asked you to watch over Alexander. I was wondering if you would consider formalising that arrangement. I want you to be Alexander's Soh-chlm. His Soh-chlm? You would become his surrogate mother. In case anything happened to me, you would be responsible for him. I don't know what to say. It's a great honour. So, that would make me your...? The closest analogy is stepsister. That would make my mother your stepmother. I had not considered that. It is a risk I am willing to take. I accept. Lt Worf, please report to Engineering. I am on my way. We have analysed the imaging logs. It appears the array was programmed to observe several Federation sites. This is Deep Space Five, Starbase 47, the ladara Colony, and the Utopia Planitia Shipyards. They're responsible for starship development. Someone is using the array for covert surveillance of the Federation. That is our theory. We believe unauthorised access was made six days ago. The imaging logs show a ship approaching the array. That is a Cardassian ship, Galor-class. We're only three light years from Cardassian space. Mr Worf, start a long-range scan for any Cardassian ships nearby. Aye, sir. Here's a proportional analysis of the Cardassian vessel. Scan for its energy configuration. Lieutenant. Are you alright? I feel dizzy. You don't look so good. You ought to go to sickbay. Yes, perhaps I will. Any nausea or blurred vision? No. However, I did experience some dizziness earlier today at my birthday celebration. Sounds like side effects from the concussion. I can give you some vertazine, but I'd like you to rest. You are thinking of another patient. I have no concussion. Worf, you came in this morning complaining of ringing in your ears. I scanned you, you had a concussion. You don't remember any of this? No. Temporary memory loss is common for this kind of injury. Do you remember telling me about the bat'leth tournament? You said a competitor hit you over the head. That's why you lost the match. I won that tournament. And I can prove it to you! What's wrong? It says ninth place. This is not the same trophy. Someone is playing a trick on me. Worf, try to stay calm. Memory loss can be very disorienting. Log. I recorded a personal log on my way back to the Enterprise. Computer, access personal logs on Shuttlecraft Curie. Show my log entry for stardate 47391.2. Personal log, stardate 47391.2. I am returning from the ""bat'leth"" competition on Forcas III. The conditions were difficult. Several contenders were maimed. One contender used an illegal ""T'gha"" manoeuvre on me. The judges chose to ignore it. I was robbed of my rightful standing. I was awarded ninth place. I look forward to resuming my duties... I do not understand. Worf, I'm sure this is very disturbing for you. But don't worry, your memories will return. The best thing right now is to settle back into your routine, but slowly. Thank you, Doctor. Let me know if you have any more dizziness. I'll give you a hypospray. Lieutenant, have you completed the metallurgical scan of the array? Sir? The metallurgical scan. Have you completed it? I do not remember you asking... Captain, there's a Cardassian ship approaching. Galor-class. Open a channel. On screen. This is Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise. You are in Federation territory. Please explain your presence. We were wondering the same thing about you. Why would Starfleet's flagship venture so close to our border? We are repairing one of our subspace telescopes. I see. May we offer our assistance? No, thank you. Everything is under control. If you don't mind my asking, what exactly is this telescope of yours designed to do? It is a long-range subspace array. We use it for gathering data on astronomical phenomena. I'm certain it would never be used to observe a neighbouring species. Certainly not. Well, then, best of luck with your repairs. Just try to make certain that your studies are limited to astronomical phenomena. Charming fella. Captain, that ship was responsible for reprogramming the array. What are you saying? It's the same class as the ship we saw in the imaging logs. The imaging logs? Are you suggesting the Cardassians have tampered with the array? They're using it as a surveillance device. You saw the logs. I haven't heard this. Neither have I. Cmdr Data, show them the logs you downloaded. I know of no such logs. Mr Worf, are you alright? Yes. Mr Data, re-examine the array. See if you can find any evidence to support Mr Worf's claims. Dr Crusher says I have memory loss but it is more than that. I remember those imaging logs, every detail, every word! Let's assume you're right, that things did happen as you remember. Are you saying that everyone's memory has been altered but yours? Enter. Counsellor. I wanted you to know that we re-examined the logs. They don't show a Cardassian ship or any evidence of reprogramming. From what we can tell, the array suffered a simple mechanical failure. That is not right. I was certain... What's wrong? Counsellor, the painting that Cmdr Data gave me... It has moved. I hung that painting there. At your birthday party, remember? No. The painting has changed. Don't you see it? Your hair and your clothing. They have changed as well. Worf, come with me to sickbay. Now, Mr Worf. Now. What are you waiting for? Raise the shields. This panel configuration has been altered. I do not know how. Direct hit. Engineering section and deck 42. Shield generators are overloading. Number One. Firing photon torpedoes. Full spread. Direct hit on their main reactor. They are returning fire. We have sustained heavy damage to the deflector systems. Hull breaches on decks 17 and 36. Ensign, take us out of here. Aye, sir. Are they pursuing us? No, sir. They are firing on the array. They destroyed it, sir. Bridge to Engineering. Mr La Forge, status? This is Ensign Hayes. Cmdr La Forge is in sickbay with plasma burns. There is damage to the plasma conduit but it's under control. Acknowledged. Lay in a course to Starbase 129. Aye, sir. What happened back there, Mr Worf? I believe I experienced another memory loss. Memory loss? What are you talking about? I do not feel well. Request permission to be temporarily relieved of duty, sir. Granted. Computer, access personal logs on Shuttlecraft Curie. Play log entry for stardate 47391.2. There is no log entry from the Shuttlecraft Curie for that stardate. Computer, display any log entries concerning the bat'leth tournament on Forcas III. Personal log, stardate 47391.2. There has been a malfunction in the main deflector. It will require two more days of repairs. As a result, I will not be able to compete in the ""bat'leth"" tournament. I have asked my brother to take my place. He does not have my prowess... Why did you lock the door? Why shouldn't I? I heard what happened on the bridge. Are you alright? I am not sure. Do you want to talk? I would rather not, Counsellor. Very well, Lieutenant. Hot chocolate. Is there something I can do for you? Actually, there is. Come and sit down. I just want you to relax for a minute. There. You are so tense. Now, I know you don't want to talk about what happened, but there are times when it's best to let things out. Come on. If you can't talk to me, who can you talk to? I do not believe this is appropriate. Even for your wife? Wife? Worf, what's wrong? I do not know. Things are changing. What's changed? I do not remember us, you and I, being mates. It is as if events, circumstances, change from moment to moment, but I am the only one who seems to be aware of it. Are you saying you don't remember the last three years? You don't remember us falling in love and getting married? I do remember the last three years. But they were different. We did not have this relationship. We were friends. And the Enterprise did not have a battle with the Cardassians. And no one believes me. Whatever's wrong, whatever happened... ...I want you to know that I believe you. And that I love you. And together, we'll find out what's happening. I am initiating a subspace scan to search for temporal anomalies on and off the ship. Counsellor Troi, report to sickbay. I'm on my way. Let me know if you find anything. Commander, how long have I been married to Counsellor Troi? Two years, one month, 12 days. And when did this relationship begin? It is my understanding it began shortly after you recovered from your spinal injury on stardate 45587. Six months later, you asked Cmdr Riker for formal permission to court Counsellor Troi. You felt to do otherwise would be dishonourable. And then we mated? I am not privy to the details of when your first coupling took place. I could investigate. No, that is alright. I am detecting no temporal anomalies in this system. Perhaps we should attempt to pinpoint the exact moment when events became discontinuous. Do you remember the first change? I was in sickbay. Dr Crusher said I had a concussion, but I do not remember it. Think back. Are you certain that was the very first change? Before... Yes. I was in Engineering. I felt the wave of dizziness. When I looked up, you and Cmdr La Forge were on the opposite side of the room. Capt Picard was gone. I thought I had blacked out and had not observed your movements. At my birthday party, the cake was chocolate. Then it was yellow. Riker told me Capt Picard would not attend. Then suddenly he was there. We should try to find commonalities in these events. Who were the people you were with? Everyone was at my birthday party. Then I was with Counsellor Troi, then Cmdr La Forge came in. Geordi. Geordi was present at all three locations. And he was near me in each case as I noticed the differences. There has to be a connection. It is possible. We should speak to Cmdr La Forge. Doctor. Is Geordi well enough to answer a few questions? Geordi's dead. There do not appear to be any unusual readings. Energy residuals from the plasma burns. Beginnings of cellular decomposition. I see nothing that connects these bio-readings to your recent sense of discontinuity. What about his visor? I still see nothing unusual. Perhaps we should activate it. Hook it up to the diagnostic array. The visor is active. Worf, are you alright? Have you noticed another discontinuity? Dr Crusher was not here. Dr Ogawa was. Dr Ogawa? My uniform has changed. What is my rank and position? You're a commander and first officer. Are we still married? Yes. I am detecting a quantum flux in your cellular RNA. What does that mean? I do not know. I will have to analyse the readings. I have found the quantum flux in Worf's cellular RNA extends to the subatomic level. It is asynchronous with normal matter. In essence, Mr Worf does not belong in our universe. What? All matter resonates on a quantum level with a unique signature. That signature is constant. It cannot be changed through any process. It is the foundation of existence. Worf's quantum signature is different from ours? Yes, sir. I cannot explain it. It is as if he originates from a different quantum universe. Mr Worf, the discontinuities started after you returned from a bat'leth tournament? Yes, sir. You never attended that tournament. No shuttlecraft has left for over a month. I understand that, but I clearly remember attending and returning in a shuttlecraft. Do you remember your route? Yes. Backtrack that course. Look for any unusual readings or anomalies. If I may enquire, sir, how long have you been Captain? Four years. Ever since Capt Picard was killed in the incident with the Borg. You don't remember, do you? I do remember. I just remember differently. Captain, I'm picking up a minor subspace disturbance. Full stop. Analysis, Mr Data. It appears to be a quantum fissure in the space-time continuum. On screen. The anomaly cannot be seen. I believe I can enhance it with a warp field. Dangerous? Not from this distance. I am also detecting an ion trail intersecting the phenomenon. I believe it was left by a Starfleet type-six shuttlecraft. So I was here. I have an explanation, sir. I believe the quantum fissure we discovered is a fixed point across the space-time continuum. A keyhole which intersects many other quantum realities. What are quantum realities? For any event there is an infinite number of possible outcomes. Our choices determine which outcomes will follow. But there is a theory in quantum physics that all possibilities that can happen do happen in alternate quantum realities. Somehow I have been shifting from one reality to another? That is correct. How did this happen? When Worf's shuttlecraft came into contact with the fissure, I believe its warp engines caused a small break between realities. Worf was thrown into quantum flux. He immediately shifted into other realities. And Geordi's visor triggered that effect? Exactly. The visor uses a subspace field pulse. Whenever Geordi came near Worf, the field pulse intensified the quantum flux and pushed Worf into another reality. How can we find my original quantum state? We could scan the fissure, using a subspace differential pulse. Maybe we could find the quantum state that shares Worf's signature. An excellent idea, Lieutenant. From what I understand... ...there's a good chance my Worf won't return. I guess it's hard for me to accept that there's a reality out there where you never loved me. Deanna, I have always considered you a close friend. Although I have never seriously considered a romantic relationship, I would not be opposed to the possibility. What about our children? Children? You didn't know? When the last shift occurred, we did not have any children. We have a little girl, Shannara, she's two years old, and a three-year-old boy, Eric-Christopher. What about Alexander? Alexander? He was my son in another reality. I've used the pulse to analyse ten million states within the fissure but I haven't found one with your signature. This may take some time, sir. A Bajoran ship is approaching. Red alert. The Bajorans? After the Bajorans overpowered the Cardassians they became aggressive. They destroyed a subspace telescope because they thought we were spying. They're charging their weapons. Shields. Return fire. They've damaged our power systems. It's caused an energy surge. The quantum fissure is beginning to destabilise. Can we disengage the pulse? Too late, sir. What is happening? The barriers between realities are breaking down. Other realities are emerging into our own. The Bajoran ship is disengaging, sir. The rate of quantum incursions is increasing exponentially. The sector will be filled with Enterprises within three days. Captain, we're receiving 285,000 hails. I wish I knew what to tell them. Mr Data, can we stop these incursions? Perhaps, if we find the ship that matches Worf's signature. How would that help? It was Worf's shuttlecraft which traversed the fissure and weakened the barriers. If he enters the fissure in his shuttle and emits a broad spectrum warp field, it may seal the fissure and stop additional realities entering. What then? How do we get the Enterprises already here back? In theory, sealing the fissure should restore the barriers between quantum states. The ships would return to their own realities. Lt Crusher, send a general hail, all ships. Aye, sir. This is Capt Riker of the Enterprise. That is, the Enterprise that is indigenous to this universe. We've all encountered a quantum anomaly. We think we can return us all to our proper realities. But we need that ship which exhibits a certain quantum signature. Our Mr Data will transmit that signature to you now. Anything? There's too much comm traffic to isolate who is talking to who. Wait a minute. Here it is. Someone's responding. On screen. Captain, we have found the quantum signature you are looking for. Data believes that sending Worf back through the fissure will return us to our realities. Our Data says the same thing. We need your Shuttlecraft Curie. We're launching it now. Thank you. It's good to see you, Captain. It's been a long time. Did they send the right shuttle? Yes, sir. It matches Worf's quantum signature precisely. I have remodulated the engines to emit an inverse warp field. You will need to activate it when you enter the fissure. If it works, will I find myself near my own ship? That is one possibility. However, the uncertainty principle dictates that time is a variable in this equation. You may end up several days before the event, or after. There is no way to tell. I understand. Good luck. Setting course for the fissure. Acknowledged. The shuttlecraft is under attack. The Bajorans again. No, sir, one of the Enterprises. They're hailing us. On screen. We won't go back. You don't know what it's like. The Federation's gone, the Borg is everywhere. We're one of the last ships left. Please, help us. There's no choice. If this works... No, we won't go back. Sir, they're firing. Open fire, try to disable them. Direct hit. Their shields have collapsed. Their core is overloading. What happened? The ship had taken heavy damage. Their warp-containment field was weak. Probably from fighting the Borg. Worf is entering the fissure. Charging primary systems. Initiating inverse warp field. Worf to Enterprise. Enterprise here. Captain, is everything alright? Yes, Lieutenant. Is there a problem? No, I do not believe so, but I will explain when I arrive. How was the ""bat'leth"" tournament? It was fine, sir. I won champion standing. This quantum fissure is nothing to worry about? No. The inverse warp field resealed it. I look forward to your report. Something wrong? I know what you are planning. I will not be surprised. I don't know what you're talking about. Of course you don't. Welcome home, Worf. I hope you don't mind, I let myself in. I promised Alexander I'd feed his beetle while you were both away. So you do not live here? What's that supposed to mean? It is a long story. Happy birthday, Worf. Will wanted a surprise party, but I knew you'd hate it, so I talked him out of it. Thank you. I know Klingons like to be alone on their birthdays. You probably want to meditate or hit yourself with a painstik. Deanna. You do not have to leave. I have not had dinner. Would you care to join me? I'd love to. Champagne. "
S7E12,"I don't see why we have to do this every year. I thought the teachers agreed they wouldn't do this any more. Capt Picard Day is one of the children's favourite activities. They look forward to it all year. Why does it have to be me? You're the Captain. They look up to you. You're a role model for them. Well, they seem to have a somewhat exaggerated impression of me. The resemblance is striking. Wouldn't you agree, Number One? Isn't there something you can do? I'll be on the bridge. Will. The finalists will be here soon. You have to pick first, second and third, and four honourable mentions. Worf to Captain. Transmission from Admiral Blackwell. It is coded Priority One. Put it through. Excuse me. Yes, Admiral? Captain. What is your status? We are conducting energy-output studies of the Merkoria Quasar. All systems normal and fully operational. Good. I'm postponing the quasar study for the moment. The Enterprise is to rendezvous with the Starship Crazy Horse in Sector 1607 immediately. You may exceed warp-speed limitations for the duration of this assignment. I understand. What is our assignment? I'd prefer not to discuss it over subspace channels. The Crazy Horse will be carrying someone from Starfleet Intelligence. He'll brief you when he arrives. Very well. Capt Picard Day? Yes. It's for the children. I'm... I'm a role model. I'm sure you are. Starfleet out. So, who won the contest? Paul Menegay, a seven-year-old. He did a clay sculpture of my head. Was that the orange one with lumpy skin? Yes. You'll be interested in our Cmdr Riker Day next month. I'm considering making an entry myself. Great. Energise. Aye, sir. Will. I bet you never thought you'd see me again. It's good to see you. Sure. You look like you're about to faint. No. It's just been a long time. Capt Jean-Luc Picard. Admiral Erik Pressman. Pressman. Of course. You were Will's first commanding officer on the Pegasus. That's right. The Pegasus is the reason I'm here. Sir? She's still out there. And the Romulans have found her. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. As you know, the Pegasus was lost 12 years ago with most of her crew. I was her captain. Cmdr Riker was my helmsman. I remember. The ship was destroyed by a warp-core breach. The Captain and I made it to a pod before the breach became critical. From space, we observed an explosion which vaporised the ship. No wreckage was found, so Starfleet declared the ship destroyed. However, all that changed three days ago. Starfleet Intelligence has an operative in Romulan High Command. He sent us a message that a Romulan warbird located a piece of debris which was identified as being from the Pegasus. The warbird was ordered to locate the rest of the ship. Why do they want pieces of a 12-year-old starship? The Pegasus was a prototype. Experimental engines. In fact, some of our designs were used on the Enterprise. There are things on board the Romulans would love to have. What are our orders? To find the ship. Salvage it if possible. Destroy it if necessary. You command the Enterprise, I command the mission. We'll need the metallurgical specs to set up search parameters. I'll make the information available. Very well. Lay in a course for the Devolin system. Aye, sir. Captain, we are approaching the Devolin system. Any sign of the Romulans? No, sir. They're out there, waiting to see what you'll do. Mr La Forge? There's an awful lot of ionising radiation. That will slow down our search. How slow? I'd say... Romulan warbird decloaking ahead. They are powering weapons. Shields up. Red alert. Prepare phasers. Sir, they are hailing us. On screen. I am Cmdr Sirol of the Romulan vessel Terix. To whom do I have the honour of speaking? I am Capt Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. Capt Picard. I've heard much about you. A pleasure to make your acquaintance. I hope our sudden appearance didn't startle you. Not at all. But your unannounced appearance might have unfortunate consequences. It would be a shame if your ship were damaged due to some misunderstanding. I am touched by your concern for my ship, but I doubt we were ever in any danger. May I ask what you are doing here? I might ask you the same. We are conducting a survey of gaseous anomalies. How interesting. So are we. Perhaps we could combine our efforts and share our findings. I doubt our objectives are compatible. Perhaps you're right. This has been most pleasant, but we must return to our research. Then I won't keep you. Sir, they are moving off, resuming their tachyon scans. Stand down red alert, but keep tracking their movements. Aye, sir. Commander, how long to search the system? At least seven days. And the Romulans have a two-day head start. Let's get to it, Mr Data. Initiating sensor sweep of grid zero one. How long have you had that beard? Four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. What was it that Lt Boylen used to call you? Ensign Baby Face. You never did have much of a sense of humour. I like to think that I've lightened up. Really? I've told a joke or two. It's about time. You were always so serious on the Pegasus. We went through some serious times. Do you think we'll find the Pegasus? I wouldn't have come if I didn't. What about the experiment? Do you think we'll find that? Maybe. I think a lot about what happened, especially on that last day. So do I. It's not the kind of thing you just forget. Do you ever wonder if we did the right thing? Never. What happened was a tragedy but it wasn't your fault or mine. What we did was for the Federation. We can't blame ourselves if the others couldn't see that. I know, but maybe we went about it the wrong way. This time we may have a chance to do it the right way. If we're successful, if we find the Pegasus and the experiment, we can finish what we started 12 years ago. You want to try it again? Not just me. The Chief of Starfleet Security has given me her complete support. Admiral Ranar? How many other people know about this? Not many and we must make sure it stays that way. Ranar has given me orders for you, coded in the computer. You've been instructed not to reveal our mission to anyone else, not even Capt Picard. Will, don't worry. It won't be like it was 12 years ago. And this time, no one's gonna stop us. As a matter of fact, I never met Will until he reported on board at Farpoint Station. You chose your first officer without ever meeting him? I was looking through the records of 50 candidates and Will's was very much like all the others, filled with lots of dry statistics and glowing letters of recommendation that tell you nothing. I was about to put it aside and look at another file, and then something caught my eye. There was an incident on Altair III when Will was on the Hood. He refused to let Capt DeSoto beam down during a crisis. He disobeyed a direct order and he risked a court martial because he thought he was right. When I read that, I knew that I had found my number one. You wanted someone with a history of disobedience? I wanted someone who would stand up to me, who was more concerned with the safety of the ship and doing the mission than with how it might look on his record. To me, that's a mark of a good officer. Frankly, I feel it's more important to trust a captain's judgement. In a crisis, there's no time. Orders have to be obeyed or lives may be lost. I'm aware of that, Admiral. Of course you are. I guess this mission has brought up some old ghosts for me. Know what it's like to lose a ship? You always wonder if there was something you missed. Admiral, the record regarding the loss of the Pegasus is a bit vague from the moment before you abandoned ship. Is there anything you can add? I'm afraid not. But I can tell you this. 12 years ago, I needed an officer that I could count on, someone who would obey me without question, someone willing to trust my judgement. That someone was Will Riker. Without his loyalty, none of us would have survived. What's wrong? I think I busted a rib. Excuse me. What were you doing? I was doing bat'leth moves with Mr Worf. I jabbed when I should have blocked. He got me. It's a good thing we were using sticks, not blades. It's broken, alright. Give him 10cc of terakine. I can't believe how stupid I was. You both must have got carried away. It was my fault. I got distracted at a crucial moment. It can happen to anyone. I knew what I was supposed to do. If those had been real bat'leths, I might be dead right now. There, all better. Will, it's alright. You made a mistake. No harm done. You'll be better next time. Yeah, maybe. Scan of grid 157 is complete. I am moving to grid 158. The Romulan warship is still searching grid 270. They're spending a lot of time there... Commander, I think we might have struck pay dirt. There's a subspace resonance signature coming from that asteroid. From the frequency, it looks like a Federation warp core. Capt Picard to the bridge. Take us to within ten kilometres of asteroid Gamma 601. Geordi's found something. There's a resonance signature coming from that asteroid. It could be the Pegasus. I think he's right. I recognise the variance patterns. Put the asteroid on the main viewscreen. I have confirmed Geordi's readings. The signatures are originating from beneath the surface. Beneath the surface? How? The asteroid contains deep chasms large enough for a starship to enter. It is possible the Pegasus drifted into the gravitational field and was pulled into a fissure. Sir, the Romulan warbird has altered course once again. They're heading towards us. They want to see what we're interested in. Mr Data, how long will it take to determine the location? At least another six hours. That's too long. If the Romulans search the asteroid, they could find the ship. I recommend we destroy the asteroid. It would take our photon torpedoes but would preclude the Pegasus falling into Romulan hands. Our top priority is salvage. I'll destroy it as a last resort. Yes, sir. Captain, could you give me a third alternative? Is it possible to saturate the asteroid with verteron particles that would mask the resonance signature and prevent detection? In order to succeed, it would have to appear to be a natural phenomenon. Verteron particles are artificial in nature. Wait. We can blanket the asteroid with ionising radiation. There's so much of it, the Romulans won't know the difference. Mr Data? Theoretically, it should work. If we do this, we have to do it fast. The Romulans will be in range in a minute. Make it so. Aye, sir. Initiating ionisation-field pulse. When he's finished, we'll make it look as if we haven't found anything. Lay in a course for the next search. If it works, the Romulans won't find anything and we can return later. If it doesn't... We'll have handed them the Pegasus. Ionisation pulse complete. Helm, one-quarter impulse. Engage. The Romulans are initiating a tachyon scan of the asteroid. They have switched to their lateral sensors. Beginning another scan. They're being thorough. The warbird has completed its sweep. If they found the signature, they should be sending away teams any second. They are moving out. Mr Data, we must convince the Romulans that we're still looking. Continue scanning this system. Aye, sir. I want to be back at this asteroid at 0800 tomorrow. Plan your search accordingly. Aye. Admiral, care to join me for some late dinner? Please excuse me. I'll turn in early. You have the bridge, Number One. Will you bring the scan analysis to my quarters? Aye, sir. Initiate search of grid 163. Beginning sensor sweeps. Commander, I want to see you in the Captain's ready room. Mr Data, you have the bridge. Aye, sir. What is the matter with you? Destroy the Pegasus before looking at it? I thought it was more important... Well, you were wrong! We can change the balance of power but we can't do that if we destroy the Pegasus, can we? No, sir. It hasn't been easy for you, keeping your captain in the dark. I haven't enjoyed it, if that's what you mean. I hope you understand it's necessary. I understand that you think it's necessary. You have changed. Changed... Something the Captain and I were talking about. To be honest, I'm glad to see this change. State your opinion and stand by it. It's a far cry from the young man who worried about pressing the wrong button. A lot of things can change in 12 years, Admiral. Yes, they can. But it's important that a man changes the right things, not his sense of duty, not his sense of loyalty. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things. I would like to think that, too. Because those things say more about a man than the rank on his collar. They define him. 12 years ago, a lot of older officers turned away from their duty, but you stood for what was right. I'm sorry, Will. I know the kind of man you are. I know that I can count on you again. Come. The scan analysis you asked for. Thank you. Is there something else, sir? Yes, there is. ""Judge Advocate General's report, stardate 36764."" ""Subject, inquiry into mutiny aboard USS Pegasus."" ""Based on testimony from Capt Pressman and others, the Judge Advocate believes there is sufficient evidence to conclude that members of the crew did mutiny against the Captain just prior to the destruction of the Pegasus."" Mutiny on a Federation starship? That's shocking. It's unthinkable. Yet you've never mentioned it. No, sir. You know, it wasn't easy to get this report. I had to pull in quite a few favours just to look at it. It seems that it was classified by Starfleet Intelligence. So, not only was the Pegasus carrying sensitive equipment, which must not fall into Romulan hands, not only was there a mysterious explosion which seemed to destroy the ship but didn't... ...but it seems there was a mutiny. I've read the official report of the inquiry on that mutiny but I want your version of what happened. I was on the bridge. The ship was at yellow alert. We were running tests on the engines. Something went wrong. There was an explosion in Engineering. Heavy casualties. The First Officer, Engineering Chief and most of the bridge crew mutinied against Capt Pressman. Why? They thought he jeopardised the ship. And you? I was seven months out of the Academy, my head ringing with words like ""duty"" and ""honour"". When they turned on him, I thought they were a bunch of disloyal officers. I grabbed a phaser and I defended my captain. Two or three others joined us but it was clear by then that the mutineers had most of the crew behind them. We felt a need to get off the ship. There was a running firefight to the escape pod. About five minutes after we left the ship, there was an explosion. ""The Judge Advocate also believes that the surviving officers are deliberately withholding vital information."" ""Investigation is recommended."" There was no investigation. This report was classified and then it was quietly buried. Why? Sir, take this up with Admiral... I'm taking this up with you. The Judge Advocate thought that you covered up the truth. Now, what the hell is going on here, Will? Why did that mutiny happen? Why is Pressman determined to find your ship 12 years later? I've said all I can. I'm under direct orders from Admiral Pressman not to discuss this, sir. Very well. He's an admiral. I'm a captain. I cannot force you to disobey his orders. I will have to remain in the dark on this mission. I'll have to trust that you will not let Pressman put this ship at risk. If I find that trust is misplaced, I will re-evaluate the command structure of this ship. Dismissed. Captain. Starfleet places the highest priority on this mission. Your request for a delay is denied. Margaret, something's very wrong here. Do you know what's going on? I know that the Chief of Intelligence is watching this one. You'd be well advised to follow orders. Leave it at that. Starfleet out. Worf to Capt Picard. We are approaching asteroid Gamma 601. On my way. Mr Worf, where are the Romulans? Out of sensor range on the far side of the system. Take us to within 15 kilometres of the asteroid. Hold that position. Mr Data, report. I have been scanning the area where we detected the signature of the Pegasus. From the strength of the signature, it appears the warp core is intact. If we're lucky, the entire Engineering section is there. But how do we get to it? I wouldn't transport through so much solid rock. Agreed. What about a shuttle? Send it through a fissure. I would recommend against it. There may be gravometric fluctuations inside the asteroid which would overpower the engines. Sounds like the best solution is to take the Enterprise in. Into the asteroid? That's right. Put this fissure on the main viewer. This chasm is large enough. Besides, to salvage the Pegasus, we'll need a starship. Mr Data? It is theoretically possible, sir. But I am unaware of any prior situations where a starship was taken so deeply inside. There may be unforeseen difficulties. We can't risk... I've made my decision. Prepare to take the Enterprise in, Captain. That's an order. Mr Data, note in the ship's log that this action is being taken over my explicit objection. It is so noted, sir. Yellow alert. Inertial dampers at maximum. Ensign Gates, plot a course into the chasm, manoeuvring thrusters only. Course plotted, sir. Take us in. We are two kilometres beneath the surface. Captain, we are encountering shifts in the magnetic-field density. If this passage narrows to less than 500 metres, I will abort the mission. Charge me with insubordination, but I won't risk the Enterprise. I'm reading a large resonance signature directly ahead. Pegasus. What the hell happened? Sensors show the ship is intact. However, 65 percent of it is within the asteroid. Looks as if half the ship materialised inside solid rock. Yes, sir. I do not understand how this could happen. Keep speculation to a minimum and begin the operation. The equipment was in Main Engineering. Scan that section. The starboard bulkhead is contained within the rock face. Most of its compartment is intact. There is a hull breach. If we begin a power transfer, can we restore life-support systems to that compartment? I believe so. The breach can be sealed by our shields. See to it. Once you restore life support, Cmdr Riker and I will beam aboard. I would like a complete team. There is some sensitive equipment. I don't want anyone else near it. Yes, sir. This room was open to space for 12 years. A vacuum. It preserved everything. I wonder how many of the crew are buried there. We're not here for a memorial service. It's still intact. What's the matter? Don't you understand? We've found it. I know. I kept hoping it wouldn't be here, that it had been destroyed, that it was buried in that rock back there. What's that supposed to mean? It means that I can't put this off any longer. Right up to this moment, I had the luxury of time. But now I've got to make a choice. And, Admiral, I'm afraid my choice is this. I can't let you start these experiments again. It was wrong 12 years ago. It is wrong today. You had better reconsider. We have a mission to accomplish. That's all you care about, starting these experiments again. Look around. This room is filled with dead bodies because of this. Keep your self-righteous comments to yourself. I knew these people longer than you did. It was their fault. You don't know that. We don't know what happened after we left. It's not hard to guess. They shut down an experiment they didn't understand and it killed them. No, we killed them. That doesn't sound like the man who defended his captain 12 years ago. I've had 12 years to think about it. If I had it to do over again, I'd have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you. So, on reflection, you'd rather be a traitor than a hero. I wasn't a hero. Neither were you. What you did was wrong, but I was too young and stupid to realise it. You were captain. I was the ensign. I was just following orders. If you hadn't, you'd be dead along with them. Dead because you listened to a bunch of cowards blinded by fear. They were brave enough to risk their lives to stop you from violating a treaty the Federation signed. That treaty has bound our hands and given the Romulans a tactical advantage for 60 years. I was trying to level the playing field. And now you want to try it again? How many people will die this time? 50? 100? 1,000? You don't want to help me? Fine. But you are still under my orders not to talk about what you know. I made you, mister, and I can break you. Do you understand me? Picard to away team, prepare to return to the ship. Stand by, Enterprise. Pressman to Enterprise. Two people and one piece of equipment to beam up. Report. The Romulans destroyed the entrance to the chasm with their disrupters. They've sealed us in. Sir, there is an incoming message. It is from the warbird. On screen. Aye, sir. Captain, you seem to be in a very unfortunate circumstance. How can we help? Are you responsible for this? I'm not sure. We were conducting some geological experiments on the surface. It is entirely possible that we accidentally sealed you in. If we'd known you were beneath the surface, if you had shared your plans, this might have been avoided. What do you want? I don't want anything. But I will offer to help you. How? By transporting your crew aboard my ship. We'll take you back to Romulus where, after a short stay, you will be returned to the Federation. Thank you for your generous offer. I will take it under advisement. As you wish. We will continue our research here for a while longer. I await your decision. We can't do it. They'll come back and get both ships. Agreed. Options? We could use the phasers to cut our way out. The asteroid's internal structure is highly unstable. Any attempt to cut through the rock could cause a collapse. Captain, I have a suggestion. There's a piece of equipment in Admiral Pressman's quarters that might get us out of here. It's a prototype for a Federation cloaking device. You just ended your career, Will. That's what it's about. A cloaking device. In the Treaty of Algeron, the Federation agreed not to develop cloaking technology. And that treaty is the biggest mistake we ever made. It's kept us from exploiting a vital area. That treaty has kept us in peace for 60 years, and as an officer, you're supposed to uphold it. Now, that's enough! I'm taking command of this vessel. Mr Worf, escort the Captain to his quarters. I don't think anyone's going to come to your defence. How do we use the cloak to escape from the asteroid? It's more than a cloak. It changes the structure of matter. In theory, a ship using this device could pass through normal matter. I see why you wanted to find it. Can't you see the potential here? The phasing cloak would be the greatest breakthrough in 50 years. Except that it's illegal. It's in violation of an agreement signed in good faith. Captain, I think we could adapt the cloak for the Enterprise. Mr Data? Theoretically, it is possible. But it would take several hours to link it to our systems. Make it so. Captain's log, stardate 47457. 1. We have been trapped inside the asteroid for over eight hours. Mr Data and Cmdr La Forge are nearly ready to engage the cloak. Commander, we've routed the impulse engines through the plasma conduits. Watch the intercooler levels. If they get too high, we'll blow the relay system. Understood. I think that's what happened 12 years ago. The cloak blew out the plasma relays on the Pegasus. The plasma ignited in space and it looked as if the ship had been destroyed. The ship drifted into this system still in a phased state. When it passed through this asteroid... The cloak failed and half of the ship materialised in solid rock. La Forge to bridge. The cloak is ready to begin phase sequencing. Proceed, Number One. Activating power systems. Report. The cloak is functioning normally. The ship's matter-energy phasing rate should be sufficient. Take us out. Manoeuvring thrusters only. We will reach the rock face in five seconds. We have passed through two kilometres of the asteroid. Now within one kilometre of the surface. We're approaching the surface. We have cleared the asteroid. The warbird is off the port bow. They're still waiting for us to make up our minds. Disengage the cloaking device. You cannot. If the Romulans see... They'll know the truth, Admiral. Which is what everyone will know shortly. Carry out my orders. Send a message to the warbird. Tell them that their government will be contacted about this. Aye, sir. Admiral, I am charging you with violation of the Treaty of Algeron. As Captain, I am placing you under arrest. Mr Worf. If you will come with me. Captain, I'll have to be placed under arrest as well. Admiral. I have a lot of friends at Starfleet Command. You're going to need them. I spoke with Fleet Admiral Shanthi. There will be a full inquiry at Starbase 247. That will probably lead to a court martial of Admiral Pressman. And several others at Starfleet Intelligence. Your involvement will be thoroughly investigated. There will be some hard questions. I understand. You made a mistake 12 years ago. But your service since then has earned you much respect. This incident could cost you some of that. I can't help but feel I should have come forward. When the moment came to make a decision, you made the right one, to tell the truth and face the consequences. As long as you can do that, you deserve to wear that uniform. And I will be proud to have you as my first officer. "
S7E13,"Captain's log, stardate 47423.9. We arrived at Boraal II in response to a distress call from Worf's foster brother, Nikolai Rozhenko. He was stationed on the planet as a cultural observer. Analysis, Mr Data. The atmosphere is dissipating, sir. Intense plasmonic reactions are destroying it. The stratosphere is already breaking down. There are turbulent radiation storms across its surface. I estimate that the planet will be uninhabitable in less than 38 hours. The distress call came four days ago. Why would Dr Rozhenko have waited so long? Atmospheric dissipation is a rare and unpredictable event. When it occurs, it proceeds rapidly. He may not have had warning. What was that? The dissipation is generating energy bursts. Is there any danger to the ship? I do not believe so. But we may experience intermittent system failures and power surges. Keep an eye on it. Mr Worf, any luck? There is no response to our hail, sir. I'm attempting to scan the observation post. He could be hurt and can't respond. Sensor interference is significant. But the post appears intact. Their power grid is still functioning. However, I am reading no life forms within the structure. It's not like him to leave the post. Not under these circumstances. Captain. I'm detecting power emissions from caverns near the post. It could be a deflector shield. That can't be native. The Boraalans don't have that technology. Captain, request permission to lead an away team. Very well. But regardless of this planet's situation, we must observe the Prime Directive. I want to minimise the risk of contact with the inhabitants. You will go down alone. I want you surgically altered to pass as a Boraalan. Aye, sir. You're worried about Nikolai, aren't you? Yes. Are the two of you close? We are brothers. You never talk about him. What's he like? Nikolai is older than I. We are not alike. We had many disagreements when we were growing up. That's not unusual. Nikolai has a mind of his own. He attended Starfleet Academy. But he was unable to follow the rules. He left after one year. But he has many fine qualities. He's brilliant, persuasive. A natural leader. Sounds intriguing. I look forward to meeting him. What are you doing here? You're not from our village. Who are you? Who is this? My name is Worf. I am a traveller. How did you survive the storms? I would know that voice anywhere. Worf, is it really you? It's good to see you. You've changed a lot in four years. Nikolai? Yes. Worf. This is my brother Worf. He's come to help us. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. If you could get here, the storms must have subsided. Please... Is it safe on the surface? Please, I must speak to my brother. Nikolai, what have you done? They were dying. I refused to sit in the post and watch it happen. I set up a deflector shield to screen these caves from the radiation and brought them here. What did you tell them? They think I am a Boraalan. At least you had that much sense. When I sent the call, I knew the Enterprise was nearby, but I wasn't sure you'd come. I'm glad you're here. Nikolai, there is nothing we can do for these people. You have only postponed their deaths. I will discuss that with your captain. And I am certain he will want to speak with you. Friends, my brother and I must go to the surface. He has provisions and needs help bringing them. We will return shortly. It's too dangerous. The storms... Don't worry. Worf is a seer. He understands the storms. He'll know when it's safe to travel. Yes, that is correct. Our seer died when the storms first came. We've been without his guidance. Let me go with you. I know the terrain. I can help. No, Vorin. Worf and I will be safe. We'll return shortly. Doctor, you were fully aware that the atmospheric dissipation could not be stopped. What did you hope to accomplish, assisting these people? I was trying to give them a future. What I propose is we create an atmospheric shield. We can camouflage the equipment. No one will ever know it's there. You can't be serious. Indeed, I am. It will only provide atmosphere for a limited area, but it will be enough to save one village. I will not compound what you have done by committing another violation of the Prime Directive. Captain, the Boraalans have a rich and beautiful culture, a deep spiritual life. They deserve the chance to survive. Isn't that what the Prime Directive was intended to do, to allow cultures to survive and grow? Not exactly. The Prime Directive was designed to ensure non-interference. But aren't we interfering either way? If we take no action, it's a decision to let them die. Exactly. We have the power to save some of them. All we have to do is exercise it. We are sworn to uphold the principle of the Prime Directive. Until that is changed, there is no further action. Is that understood? Some of my log recorders are still in my observation post. They contain most of my research. Since the only way I can preserve Boraalan culture is in a museum... ...I request permission to return to the surface. I'm afraid that won't be possible. But you can use the computer to set up a commlink and upload your data from here. If there's nothing further, you're dismissed. I'm sorry, Nikolai. I wish there were another way. I am quite familiar with your communication systems. If you like, I will help you set up your commlink. I'll do it myself. Captain, atmospheric dissipation has accelerated over several hours. I estimate the atmosphere will be completely gone within three minutes. Captain, I've completed my data uplink. With your permission, I'd like to integrate my log with the computer. Of course. The mesosphere has gone, sir. Plasmonic reactions are beginning to break down the troposphere. Put it on screen. What's going on? The plasmonic reactions are interfering with our sensors. Didn't you compensate for that? I had, sir. I will attempt to engage filtering elements. Visual re-established. This is one of those times when we must face the ramifications of the Prime Directive and honour those lives which we cannot save. I find no honour in this whatsoever, Captain. You will forgive me if I don't stay. You have the bridge, Number One. Helm, take us out of orbit. Set a course for Starbase 87. Warp five. Aye, sir. What happened? There appears to be a power drain in the EPS distribution net. What's the source? Unknown, sir. It is difficult to localise. The power drain is on my security grid, coming from deck ten. Alright, Mr Worf, get a Security team on it. Aye, sir. Concentrate your scans on the EPS transfer links. Computer, open holodeck five. Unable to comply. Holodeck five is in use. Override. Authorisation, Worf, Theta 619. Unable to comply. Holodeck control systems have been bypassed. Worf. Come in. Nikolai? What are you doing here? I have something to show you. Whatever you do, stay quiet. Look. I've done what you refused to do. I've saved them. I started thinking about this when it became clear the planet was doomed. I knew if I accessed the computer, I could generate a replica of the caves. The hard part was transporting the Boraalans without anybody on the Enterprise noticing. I blanked out the sensors and made it look like interference. It worked perfectly. The Boraalans were transported while sleeping. They never knew anything. Bridge. It's a simple plan. That's the beauty. Trust me. This is going to work. Trust you? You never had any intention of obeying the Captain. I wouldn't let those people die because your captain quoted Federation dogma to me. Your duty was to respect his orders, and to uphold the Prime Directive. Duty. That's all that really matters to you. I refuse to be bound by abstractions. The lives of the people of Boraal are far more important to me. You worry too much. You always did. Everything will work out. You have disgraced yourself. And you have disgraced me. I want nothing more to do with you. Your career is finished. I know. I would do it all again. What do you expect us to do now? You have left us with Boraalans who think they're on their planet. I didn't beam them up without a plan. I've given this thought. I think we can find a new planet to be their home. A home very different from Boraal. You can't believe that they'll be fooled. That's where the holodeck comes in. I'll tell them we're going on a journey to a different place safe from the storms. The holodeck can gradually change the terrain, so that, in the end, the holodeck will match the new planet. Then we'll simply beam them down. What if it doesn't work? What if they become aware that something is going on? Captain, I can't prepare for every contingency, but I can think on my feet. I'll deal with the situation as it evolves. I'm not enthusiastic about this plan. But I don't see that we have another option. Very well. Let's give it a try. Thank you, Captain. There are countless planets that can support the Boraalans. We need to narrow the parameters. It will take approximately nine hours to complete the analysis. Even then, there is no guarantee. That is correct. Captain, take a look at this. What is it? We've got a problem. I don't think it's possible to keep this simulation stable. Why not? The plasmonic energy bursts are affecting our systems. We are having problems with the EPS systems. As a result, the holodeck imaging processor is destabilised. It's not a question of whether it will break down, but when. There's no way round it? Not while it's running. I'd have to shut down and reinitialise the entire system. That will take hours. We'll just have to hope the simulation holds. Let's try it. Mr La Forge, monitor this situation carefully. Keep a commlink with the holodeck so as to be apprised of problems. I'll return as soon as my surgical alterations are completed and prepare the Boraalans for their journey. I don't think it's wise to leave you alone with those people. Mr Worf will accompany you. Sir, someone else would be better. Counsellor Troi is familiar... The Boraalans know you. There's no need to introduce anyone new. Aye, sir. Keep a close eye on your brother. I don't want him making it worse. My friends, we have returned. We have food. This is difficult to say, but you have a right to hear it. By the time we reached the surface, the village was gone. The storms destroyed everything. There is nothing to return to. We can't survive. Our supplies won't last forever. That's why we must leave. There is a place where there are no storms. It will be difficult, but we will have a new home. I know a way through the caves. We will travel safely to the surface. Where is this new land? As we said, it is far from here. It will not be like the home you knew. Even the stars may be different. Why would they be? How do you know it's safe? My brother is a seer. If he says we'll be safe, we will be. What's wrong? Look. Do not worry. It is an omen. What does it mean? It is the sign of La Forge. It is a message to travellers. It is said that when these lines appear and disappear in a pool of water, the road ahead will be filled with good fortune. Hang in there, Worf. Give me just a second. There. That should do it. You see? Our journey is already blessed. The road ahead is long. Let us have a meal, then prepare to leave. Worf, very good work. Apparently, we don't make a bad team. We are not a team. I am here because Capt Picard ordered me here. Don't we both share the same goal, to make this plan work? Only because you forced us into it. I'm not ashamed or sorry I saved their lives. You have not changed. You expect people to solve problems you create. I'm not here to work out childhood issues. I'm here to save a people. If that upsets you, then so be it. These are the two planets which best match our criteria. Draygo IV features an unusually large temperate zone. However, it is within three light years of Cardassian space. There are constant border disputes in that sector. The alternative is Vacca VI, located in the Cabral sector. That's pretty isolated. It has a less hospitable climate than the Boraalans are accustomed to. However, it would appear to be the better choice. Do you disagree? No, you're right. But the enormity of this is overwhelming. We are deciding the future of a species. It is a formidable responsibility. There are questions we don't have answers to. What if the climate affects them in a way we can't anticipate? How do we know they'll survive? And if they do, how will their society evolve? What impact will it have on that system? We have no idea what this decision will mean. Doctor, I do not believe we can offer any guarantees. We can simply make the best choice. Alright, Data. Vacca VI, it is. Data to bridge. Picard here. We have a new home for the Boraalans. It is Vacca VI in the Cabral sector. We can reach that in 42 hours at maximum warp, sir. Very well. Helm, set course for Vacca VI. Aye, sir. What is this? Our chronicle. The history of our village. Doesn't your village keep a chronicle? Not in this manner. How do you teach your children their history, who their ancestors were, where they come from? We tell each other stories, make up songs. Stories change with each person who tells them. But this, this will always be the same. Our chronicle has been maintained for 17 generations. I was only able to save the last six. This shows the destruction of our village. This is you and Nikolai leading us to safety. We must leave. Gather your belongings. One of the scrolls is gone. I must have dropped it. I'll go find it. We must stay together. We'll have to leave it behind. Worf, the chronicle is the life of our village. Without that past, our future means nothing. I must find it. Go. And return quickly. Seer. I am an old man. Would you help me with my gear? Of course. That is Tarrana, my daughter. I am fortunate she was old enough to survive the storms. She is a fine girl. She is a beautiful girl. She has not been promised to anyone. If I do not reach our new home... ...I would like her to become your wife. You will reach your new home. I promise. Can I help you? Do you need some help? Alright, everybody. Back off. I know things must look very strange to you. But everything's going to be alright. No one's going to hurt you. We're friends of Nikolai and Worf. Don't be afraid. Nikolai? Yes. He's my friend. That means you are, too. I promise I won't hurt you. Please. Help me. Where am I? Sorry. There's nothing I can do. His neurophysiology is very unusual. I can't wipe his memory. I see. How is he? As well as you'd expect. I've given him a mild sedative. Troi has been speaking with him. He seems much calmer. Does he understand? I think so. Contact Mr Worf. Make sure he knows what's going on. Here he is now. This is Capt Picard. Vorin, isn't it? Why did you bring us here? Your planet was dying. It could no longer support life. We took you away from it. But we never left the caves. We have the ability to create the illusion of other places, like the caves on your planet. You have actually spent the last two days here on this starship, not on Boraal. Then our home is gone. Yes. Vorin, listen to me. We can visit other worlds. We can take you to one to build a new life. A new life? A chance for your culture, your people, to survive and grow. How can we grow when everything that made us who we are is gone? Dobara, you go on ahead. I will carry your pack. Go and join the others. Thank you, Seer. It'll be dark soon. A few hours. Would you ask Mr La Forge to create a suitable campsite for us? What's wrong? Vorin has left the holodeck. How did he get out? I do not know. Dr Crusher cannot erase his memory. What will they do? They explained the situation. He must make his own decisions. Wait. If Vorin wants to come back, they'll let him? That is right. He is not a prisoner. If he comes back, everything we have done will be for nothing. You should have considered that before you beamed them on board. You never think of the consequences. If you mean I do something while others hesitate, that's true. Everywhere you go, you create chaos. How many times did our parents wonder what trouble you were in? If only I had been like you. The perfect son. I was not perfect, but I was not wild and disobedient. Of course not. You were doing your duty. I would rather be accused of that than making our mother weep. I see you have no intention of changing. I see no reason to discuss it further. Commander, the holodeck malfunctions are increasing. I'm running every stabilisation routine I know. How long till we reach the planet? We'll be there in eight hours. Hold things together a while longer. Someone is coming. May I speak with you? Yes, of course. I don't know what Nikolai said to you but, please, forgive him. It is an old argument. I've never seen him like this. He's usually so confident, so sure of himself. But now, he seems different. Do you know why? No. No, I do not. Ever since Vorin was lost, people have been afraid, worried that we won't reach our new home. We need Nikolai's strength now more than ever. When the storms first came to our village, many of us were ready to die. But Nikolai refused to let us. He gathered us together and led us into caves. He saved us. He is a brave and compassionate man. And I love him. Please, go to him. Make things right between you. I want us to be a family. Us? Yes. I want you to consider yourself my brother. After all... ...you're going to be the uncle of my child. We are over the beam-down site. Good. Mr La Forge, how much longer before we can transport the Boraalans? A few hours but we've got some problems. I don't think the holodeck will last. We've had errors and failures all over the place. It's getting worse. The simulation could fall apart any minute. Have the transporter room standing by. We may have to transport the Boraalans, ready or not. Aye, sir. You have the bridge, Number One. We still have one more problem to worry about. Yes? We have arrived at the planet. Have you made a decision? I would like to go back. I see. What do you intend to tell them? I don't know. If you tell them the truth, what will happen? Will they believe you? I'm not sure. It is a fantastic story. Perhaps they will think that you have had an hallucination, or that you're insane. I don't think I would like to live my life knowing what I know and being regarded as a madman. On the other hand, they may believe your fantastic story. They would learn about alien worlds, starships. That would be disastrous. It would destroy everything they believed in. I can't tell them the truth. But I don't think I can live with a secret. Then stay here. Make a future for yourself with us. I need some time. Please. How could you mate with a Boraalan? What were you thinking? I don't owe you an explanation. This is between Dobara and myself. As usual, you think only of yourself. As usual, you point out my errors. You have treated Dobara with dishonour. I have not! We'll raise our child together. That is not possible. You cannot remain here. You'll have to kill me first! What does it mean? It's the storms. We'll be killed. No, you won't. Worf has the power to end the storms. Yes. But everyone must shelter in the tents. The tents won't protect us. Worf will protect you. Trust him. Get to your tents. Commander, can you produce a storm? Wind, lightning and thunder. I'll see what I can do. Get in. The storm is getting worse. Stay inside. Worf and I will take care of you. Commander, energise. The storms will not return. As I said he would, my brother Worf has saved us all. Captain's log, stardate 47427.2. The Boraalans have reached the site of their new village. None of them suspects they ever left their planet. However, our success has come at a high price. I think it was some form of ritual suicide. He said that he had nowhere to go. He would've died if we hadn't interfered. But he wouldn't have died alone and afraid. Are you sorry we saved the Boraalans? No, of course not. Our plan for them worked out well. But I wish that Vorin could have bridged the gap between our two cultures. I would have liked the chance to have known him better. Go inside. Nikolai, don't. Please. I told you, you would have to kill me to get me away from here. I do not want to fight you. Things were never easy between us. No. It's my fault. If I'd been more like you, we wouldn't have had so many problems. No. If you had been more like me, these people would not be here now. You gave them a chance at a new life. And I intend to share that life with them. The village needs a new chronicle. Someone has to begin it. My child will need a father. My place is here. I'm finally taking responsibility. You were never good at drawing. How will you keep a chronicle? I learn quickly. Then perhaps there is hope. Could I take this with me? It's yours. I will have to explain to Mother and Father. They won't understand. They may. I will tell them that you are happy. "
S7E14,"Most people will remember my grandmother as a healer, but her abilities went beyond that. She didn't just relieve pain and fight illness. She knew that wellbeing is more than just a healthy body. Her remedies would include words of advice as well as medicinal teas, and often they were just as bitter-tasting. I will miss Felisa Howard very much. Her healing, her advice. Most of all, the inspiration she has provided me throughout the years. Rest in peace, Nana. And so now we commit her body to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and certain hope that her memory will be kept alive within us all. Amen. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. That was beautiful. Thank you. Deanna. Did you notice a strange man at the service? In his mid-30s with longish hair. No. He threw a flower on Nana's grave. A camellia. It was her favourite flower. She kept them all over the house. Maybe he was a friend or a patient. It was a very personal gesture. And he gave me a remarkable look. Well, I guess I should be going back to the house. There are some things I need to do. It's only a few minutes. Would you come? I'd love to. Thanks. How long are you staying? A few more hours. Why? As you know, Caldos is one of the first terraforming projects of the Federation. Our weather controls and fusion systems are a century old. I wouldn't mind having a starship engineer look at them. Perhaps give us a few upgrades. Maybe in exchange for a tour of the colony and a home-cooked meal? We are due at Starbase 621 tomorrow morning. But we could delay for a few days. I'm sure we can find time. Excellent. I would enjoy that tour. Caldos is most impressive. I feel as if I am in the Scottish Highlands. That was the intent. The cornerstone of every building in town was brought from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen. The founders wanted everyone to feel they had a piece of the real thing. They didn't want to just imitate Scotland, they wanted to recreate it. Tell me, Governor, I'm curious. You're obviously not Scots yourself. What was it that drew you here? Something about the culture, the heritage. When I was a boy, my family visited Glamis Castle in Scotland. And as I looked out across the Highlands... ...I felt as if I had come home. Your grandmother had remarkable green eyes. Every Howard woman has had green eyes, except my mother and me. How well do you remember your mother? Very well. I loved her very much. I can remember her face smiling down at me, and I can remember her voice and her scent. But mostly I remember Nana, who raised me after my mother died. That's beautiful. It's a family heirloom, in the Howard clan for generations. It's supposed to symbolise the Howard spirit. Wherever they go, the shining light to guide them through their fortune. Nana always kept it lit. I remember sitting here, listening to ghost stories, with only the candle burning. You should take it with you. I think I will. I'm going back to the ship. You don't have to leave. I thought you'd like some time alone. See you later. Thanks. Who's there? What are you doing? Get out of my house. Don't be so high and mighty, Beverly Howard Crusher. I've spent more time here than you have. How do you know who I am? I'm Ned Quint. I took care of your grandmother's house. Nana never mentioned you. There's lots she didnae talk about. Let me get rid of that candle. Why? It brought nothing but misery to your grandmother. Look, I don't know what your relationship was, but this is my house and my things. That candle's been a curse on your family for generations. If you have any sense, you'll do away with it. Give it to me. This is a family heirloom. I intend to keep it. Would you please get out of my house? Now! Howard women, always the same stubborn fools. I wash my hands of it now. You stay on in this house and keep that damn candle. I'll not be responsible for what happens. Get out. The colony's aqueduct system is functioning, as are the communication relays. We've been having tremors. Could you check the seismic stabilisers? Certainly. You can't imagine afternoon tea while the earth is shaking. Governor, did you know you had a fluctuation in your weather control? No. Our weather control's worked perfectly for 22 years. I can't isolate the source, but the fluctuation seems to originate from one of the substations regulating humidity. Will this be a problem? Not yet. But power-distribution patterns are off by five percent. I suggest we analyse weather patterns to see if they are affected. I am reading unusually high humidity across the southern desert. There is increasing cloud above the northern coast, possibly the formation of a storm system. Storm? It's the middle of summer. We don't have rain now. Let's correct this. I'll check out the climatic-flow array. I will run a diagnostic on the thermal regulators. Don't worry. We'll keep you dry. I hope so. There's a caber toss tomorrow afternoon. I'd hate to see it spoiled by an unexpected downpour. You wouldn't believe what I read in my grandmother's journals. She had a lover. Can you believe that? Nana was 100 years old. It seems that the Howard women have vigorous libidos. I certainly hope so. I hope I can find a handsome young man in his thirties when I'm 100. Thirties? Yes. According to these journals, his name is Ronin and he's 34 years old. They met just after my great-grandmother's death. I think I saw him. A handsome man tossed a camellia onto her grave. But the strange thing is, she never mentioned him in her letters. Never once. Yet it appears they spent almost all their time together. It's as if she led an entire life that I knew nothing about. It looks as if we'll be on Caldos for a few days more. This will be a good opportunity to get her affairs in order. Thank you. Thirties. Beverly. You dreamt you were in bed with someone? Not exactly. I was in bed, but there wasn't another person in my dream. It was more like a presence. You said you felt a touch. A pair of hands. They were moving across my skin. Like a caress? Yes. There was a voice, a man. He whispered my name. It was as if I knew him. Or more like, he knew me. He knew how I liked to be touched. It was the most physical dream I've ever had. The sensations were very real and extremely arousing. Frankly, I'm envious. I did fall asleep reading an erotic chapter in my grandmother's journal. She wrote detailed descriptions of her experiences with Ronin. Well, that's bound to cause a dream or two. So, shall we start going over the personnel reports? I think he had a ring on one of his hands when he touched my shoulder, my neck. I wonder if I'll have another dream tonight. I'd read two chapters. You probably want to be alone. No, it's OK. I'm sorry we got off to a bad start. I read my grandmother's journals. I know how much you meant to her. She was a grand lady. You'll not see many more like her. You have your grandmother's fire, that's for sure. Ned, you're welcome to stay at the house after I've gone to take care of the place. That's very kind of you, but I'll ne'er set foot in that house again. I recommend you dinna. Why? I tried to tell your grandmother. The house is haunted. Haunted? You believe what you want, lass, just dinna light that candle. Why not? It'll bring the ghost. It's his home. He's out now, wandering across the land, angry at being driven out. That's why he's bringing the storms. The weather system's control is malfunctioning. The Enterprise is repairing it. Sure. But who do you think is causing the malfunction? I think your imagination... Think what you want. See what you want. Just do as I say. Dinna light that candle or go to that house, or before you know it, they'll bury another Howard in this cemetery. I'm detecting atmospheric turbulence and pockets of electrical activity. On screen. It is growing in intensity. One hell of a thunderstorm. Bridge to Engineering. We are reading an extremely large storm over the colony. I thought the weather malfunction was not severe. It began as a minor fluctuation, but the effect has spread. It has caused a concentration of cumulonimbus activity. I suggest we set up a power transfer to the weather substations, try to give enough power to stabilise the storm. Make it so. Who's there? Ned? Is that you? Hello? I know somebody's here, so I suggest you... Alright, that's it. If you don't show yourself, I'll call the Enterprise. There will be ten guards here within 30 seconds. Beverly. I've come back for you. Who are you? Don't you remember? I came to you while you were asleep. No, that was a dream. I'm calling the Enterprise. Now do you remember me? Yes. What's happening to me? Right now, I feel so strange. I love you, Beverly, just as I loved Felisa before you. Are you Ronin? Yes. You saw me at the funeral. Who are you? I'm a spirit. I don't believe in... Ghosts? Nor did I in the beginning. I was born in 1647, in Glasgow, on Earth. You're telling me that you're an 800-year-old ghost? I found a home with Jessel Howard. She was a pretty lass with a mane of red hair and eyes like diamonds. I loved her very much. When she died, I stayed with her daughter, and her daughter, and on down through the years, generation after generation. And now you're here on Caldos, 200 light years away? When your family moved out into the galaxy, I moved with them. I don't believe you. I believe you are the most beautiful women I have ever known. What's... What's happening to me? We're becoming one, Beverly. We're going to be together. I don't understand. Stop it. Come in. I wanted to see if you were going to Mok'bara class this morning. No, I think I'll skip it today. I'm exhausted. Did you have another dream last night? Not exactly. Is anything wrong? Not at all. Beverly, if I didn't know better, I'd say you were seeing someone. Deanna. Now I know you're seeing someone. I'm not seeing anybody. I met someone, that's all. You obviously have romantic feelings for him. Beverly, when will you realise that you can't fool me? Who is it? Alright. I met Ronin. Ronin? Your grandmother's lover? He's unlike anyone I've ever met before. This sounds crazy, but... ...I have never known anyone who was so... Passionate. Exactly. I can see why Nana fell in love with him. This sounds very strange, doesn't it? I admit it's unusual. I'm very happy for you. But I want you to consider something. You and Ronin have both suffered a tremendous loss. Very often, shared traumatic experience can create the illusion of closeness and romance. Thank you for your concern, but I think I know what I'm doing. Besides, I didn't say I was in love with him. I'm just intrigued. I moved to this colony because it was a recreation of Scotland, but it's getting too realistic. What is going on? There is a condensed suspension of water vapour, approximately one degree Celsius. Fog. It just rolled in on us, sir. There is a malfunction in the environmental control. We traced the problem to the power-transfer beam. Some feedback is coming from a weather substation. Another power fluctuation? Captain. The temperature in ten-forward is below freezing. Deck 13 has lost gravity. Disengage the power transfer. I am unable to terminate the connection. A feedback loop has formed in the beam. I will have to go to the substation to correct the problem. Make it so. In the meantime, I think I'll go get my jacket. I have analysed the control module in the primary weather-control grid. The station is experiencing a power failure. This is impossible. The backup system... Excuse me, sir, you are dismantling the primary power conduit. I must ask you to stop. No. Get away from me. You dinna understand. He's trying to kill us all. He is dead. He was trying to shut down the weather-control system. He was pulling out the plasma conduit. That caused the discharge that killed him. I knew Ned. I don't know why'd he try something like that. It's gonna take us time to get the system back on line. Another day. In the meantime, the weather problems will continue. I think you'd better look at this. Data, you said there was a plasma discharge when Quint was killed. That is correct. That wasn't what killed him. I'm detecting an anomalous energy residual throughout his body. Whatever it is, it wasn't the result of a plasma discharge. Anything? I cannot identify the residual. However, it has the same anaphasic signature as the fluctuations from the weather-control system. Whatever caused the malfunctions also killed Quint? It is possible. Scan the colony for any readings that match this signature. With your permission, I'd like to take the body to the ship for tests. Of course, Doctor. Ensign, ask Dr Selar to run a biospectral analysis. You won't run the test yourself? No. I have some things I need to attend to. Ronin, I've got to talk to you. Are you here? I'm here. Beverly, did you miss me? Yes, but I must talk to you. There's been an accident. I know. Quint is dead. Why did it happen? What was he doing? Beverly, there's something more important we should talk about. Ronin, I've got to know. Quint's dead. Ronin? Yes. I need you to help me. Help you? It's not easy for me to take corporeal form. I can't do it for long. I want you to light the candle. Quint said you lived in the candle. Is that true? Yes. If I'm away from it for too long, I begin to weaken. That's why the women in your family have always kept the candle lit. The candle's on the ship. I'll get it. No. I must go with you. How? The power-transfer beam. I can travel along it. And when the candle's lit, then what happens? Then we'll be together. Always. Computer, secure door. I lit the candle. Where are you? It's alright. We're together. We're going to be one. I'm going to become part of you. Would you like that? More than anything. As it was with your grandmother. And all of the Howard women before them. I'll take care of you. And you will feel love as you've never felt it before. Beverly, what the hell is this? I thought it was self-explanatory. I'm leaving Starfleet. Energise. Belay that order. Aye, sir. Beverly, you can't just resign. I can, and I have. I've decided to stay on Caldos and become a healer. It's a Howard tradition. I've decided to uphold it. Energise. I've resigned my commission, so unless you plan on kidnapping me... Beverly was attracted to Ronin in a very intense and intimate way. I warned her that it was all very sudden, but she didn't want to talk about it. I sensed that she was holding back, she wasn't telling the truth. Do you think this Ronin could be exerting some influence over her? That it's because of him? It's possible, but she may believe she's in love with him. This is a rash decision. It's not like Beverly at all. I agree, but she has the right to make that choice, even if we don't feel it's a good one. Come. Captain, Geordi and I have detected an energy residual with the same anaphasic signature as the one on Ned Quint's body. Where? 17 kilometres from the centre of the colony. It is coming from the cemetery. I want you to go to the cemetery. Pinpoint the source. Aye, sir. In the meantime, I would like to meet with this Ronin. The readings are from this direction, but I can't get a location. I'll narrow the scan field. The readings appear to originate two metres below the surface. I believe they are concentrated within this burial site. I'm so glad you're here. I can't imagine what life was like before I met you. And it will only get better. Ronin. I had no idea I could feel this way. We're nearly merged now. As two candles join to form a single light, so we will flourish as one. I love you, Beverly. I love you. Beverly? Jean-Luc. Sorry I startled you. I knocked but there was no answer. The door was open. What do you want? Well, I'd hoped to meet your new friend Ronin. He's not here. Perhaps I could wait, if you don't mind. I'm anxious to meet this remarkable young man who has swept away not one but two of the Howard women. Jealousy doesn't suit you, Jean-Luc. Have you changed the colour of your eyes? I just grew tired of the other colour. Don't you think it suits me? I think that I preferred your eyes the way they were before. I think I preferred you the way you were before. Well, this is the way I am now. And this is my life. I've made my decision. I won't change my mind. Please leave me alone. There's something wrong here. This is more than a love affair that has got out of hand. Tell me, why has no one seen this Ronin except you? Alright, Captain. Here I am. I believe Beverly asked you to leave her alone. So, you're Ronin. A pleasure to meet you. Where are you from? Earth. Scotland. How long have you been on Caldos? All that matters is that I'm here now, and that we plan to be together for the rest of our lives. Data to Picard. Go ahead. We have located the source of the energy. It is concentrated within Felisa Howard's coffin. We'd like to exhume the body. You can't do that. Leave her alone. Why not? What are you afraid of? I'm not afraid of anything. But I cannot allow you to desecrate her grave. Data, ask Governor Maturin's permission to exhume the body. Picard out. I won't stand for this. I'll go to the Governor myself. Go on. I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't know who you are. He'll have the same questions that I do. What ship did you come on? Jean-Luc, leave him alone. Answer me. What ship? I'd like to look at the passenger list. Where have you been living? Who are your neighbours? Come on. Get out of here. Jean-Luc. We must stop the others. They cannot exhume the body. We can't just leave him. You must come. I am your love. I will take care of you. I can't just let him die. Beverly, come with me. No. I'm sorry. I'm going to stop them. Come on. I'm alright. Beverly, go after him. Go to the cemetery. La Forge to Enterprise. We're ready here. I am reading signs of anaphasic energy in her body. It extends to the cellular level. That's impossible. She was nowhere near the station when Quint was killed. She died of natural causes. I suggest a deep-tissue scan to look for... No! Ronin, stop this. Stop this, please. Beverly, it's alright. Have trust in me. You're not Nana. Nana's dead. Leave her alone! Beverly! Forgive me. These men tried to stop us being together. Once they're gone, everything will be right. No, it won't. You've infused me with the anaphasic energy that killed Quint. He was trying to destroy me. I had to defend myself. My love. I could never harm you. I am here to protect you. No, you're not. There's no such thing as a ghost. You are some sort of anaphasic life form. Anaphasic energy is extremely unstable. It needs an organic host to maintain molecular cohesion, or else you'll die. Beverly. I scanned the candle. The flame is plasma-based. You were using it as a receptacle to get to me, to merge with me. You have been using me, Nana, my entire family for centuries! And I loved all of them! And they loved me! Give me the candle, Beverly. No. Put it down, or I will kill him. Set it down and walk away. No! Crusher to Riker. Close off all plasma conduits at the weather-control system. Understood. You've nowhere left to go. Yes. I do. Keep away from me. Beverly. I love you. Beverly! Captain's log, supplemental. La Forge and Data have recovered from exposure to anaphasic energy. But Dr Crusher's recovery will be of a more personal nature. Somehow, he realised that one of my ancestors had a biochemistry that was compatible with his energy matrix. I imagine that he took on human form and seduced her like he did me. I was about to be initiated into a very unusual relationship. You might call it a family tradition. But there's a part of me that's sad. How so? I reread the entries in my grandmother's journals. Whatever else he might have done, he made her very happy. "
S7E15,"Fletcher has experience with propulsion systems. Carstairs is better with people. Considering this is a supervisory position, I'd go with her. I guess you're right. Didn't we just do crew-evaluation reports? Three months ago. It seems like three weeks. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night, Commander? Fine with me, Captain. Two coffees, please. What could be so funny? What's funny about crew evaluations? Don't worry about it, Sam. Can't we have a good time? How can I when my career's being decided across the room? Come on. Think promotion. You can't believe that will influence the outcome of your evaluation. It's a time-honoured strategy, Taurik. The Vedeks of the Janalan order chant for the benefit of the Bajoran people. Considering the history of your planet, that doesn't validate what he's doing. Promote me, please, so I can make lieutenant, and have my own room. If you're unhappy sharing quarters with me, put in for a new room assignment. Just in case you're not promoted. I've been thinking about ops. The night-duty officer? Lavelle is an obvious candidate. But I'm also considering Sito. Thank you. You're welcome. Are you sure about dessert? Yes. Don't tempt me. Are they working on crew evaluations? Yep. Who are they talking about? It's not my place to say. Come on, Ben! Alright, but I'm not sure you two will like it. Apparently, you two are up for the same job. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Lock phasers on target. Phasers locked. The enemy is firing. Hard to starboard. Fire phasers. Firing. Target is destroyed. End simulation sequence. Secure from drill. Alpha ship, your response was seven percent slower than the Gamma ship. All departments, submit drill- evaluation reports by 0900 hours. Ensign, you'll write that report. Yes, sir. What happened, Ensign? Sorry, sir. I had to relock phasers before I could fire. Next time, let the locking relay float until the actual order to fire is given. They may not teach that trick at the Academy, but it works. Thank you, sir. Lavelle. Resume previous course and speed. Aye aye, sir. One aye is sufficient acknowledgement, Ensign. Helm, change course for the Argaya system. What about the Clement? I've received new orders. We'll discuss it in the observation lounge. Mr Data, Mr Worf. Ensign Sito, take over at ops. Yes, sir. The Argaya system's near the Cardassian border. I wonder why we're going there. How'd you like to be a spider under that table? What? A spider under the table. Is that like a fly on the wall? I guess so. You did really well during the drill. Apparently, Cmdr Riker didn't think so. I swear he's got it in for me. You're imagining things. How come you're sitting in that chair instead of me? I guess I need more practice than you. Excuse me, sir. Do you have a minute? Sure, Taurik. Will you look at something? Have you been improvising? In a manner of speaking. I'm running a simulation to test a new warp-field configuration. You've got a problem. Your plasma flow is out of synch. Actually, sir, that was done deliberately. As you can see, this configuration has increased overall warp-field integrity by seven percent. You're right. Dr Nils Diaz has been experimenting with this technique. I'm familiar with his work. But I never heard about this. His findings have not been released yet. I reviewed a preliminary report at the Academy. I look forward to reading it. When these findings are made public, they will become a model for warp-field operations. Sounds interesting. With your permission, sir, I'd like to begin tests to see if the technique can be adapted to our warp drive. There might be variables you didn't account for. I was quite thorough. I'm sure you were. But I'd need to see your simulation before I authorise any tests. As you wish. If you have any other ideas, don't hesitate to run them by me. As a matter of fact, sir, I do. When would be a good time? I'll get back to you on that. Excuse me, Doctor. If you're wondering about the evaluations, things couldn't be better. Actually, I wanted to tell you that Ensign Riley is improving. But thank you. I'm recommending you for promotion. How does Lt Alyssa Ogawa sound? It sounds wonderful. I'll talk to Cmdr Riker. It'll be official after the evaluations. Alyssa. How are things going between you and Lt Powell? Fine. I think. You think? I'm sure it's nothing, but he seems preoccupied lately. Last night, he cancelled our date. I see. He's been putting together a research proposal. He's really busy with it. I know what that's like. Sometimes I get so busy I forget to eat. I just wonder... What? Sit down. I've never met anyone like Andrew. It's as if we've known each other forever. You do seem well suited. But I know that in the beginning of a romance, it's possible to be blind. I'm not sure I know what you mean. Well... Cancelling a date like that, the way he's been so distant. Do you think those could be warning signs that he's losing interest? Alyssa, I think you're overreacting. Maybe so. If I cared about someone as much, he'd have to do more than cancel a date before I'd get suspicious. You're right. I'm sure after this research, things will be the way they were. Except that he'll have to deal with Lt Ogawa. I was in ops for a half-hour but I degaussed the deflector dish, recalibrated the navigation grid and used internal sensors to find a lost puppy. Ops is a different challenge from tactical. I can't figure out why I'm being considered for this assignment. I'm a security officer. I recommended you. I'll try not to let you down. What are they talking about? Have you ever considered learning to lip-read? Is Worf chewing her out? No, he always looks like that. Maybe he's giving her pointers. Hi, Will. Ben. You call him Will? Why not? He's second-in-command of this ship. I'm not Starfleet, I'm a civilian. In here, he wants to be treated like a civilian. Riker? I bet he sleeps in his uniform. You only think that because he's your CO. Right. He's convinced Cmdr Riker doesn't like him. Did you crash the ship? He doesn't like me. He doesn't know you. That's right. Go talk to him. About what? Something you have in common. He likes jazz, poker. He's Canadian. My grandfather was from Canada. There you go. Hi. Excuse me, I gotta go talk to somebody. Good evening, sir. Lavelle. Something I can do? No, sir. I just came to get another drink. Is something wrong with that one? No. Actually... What are you having? Trakian ale. Good choice. I'll have one, too. My grandfather was Canadian. Really? Aren't you one, too? A grandfather? No, Canadian, sir. No, I grew up in Alaska. Well, they both get a lot of snow. Yeah. It was good talking to you, sir. Your ale, Ensign. We're holding position in the Argaya system. Anything? No, sir. I detect no vessels. How close to the Cardassian border are we? Less than 5,000 kilometres. Sir. I'm detecting an object five metres in length. It is an escape pod. He must have abandoned ship. How far into Cardassian space? 50,000 kilometres. How will we get it out? The pod's life-support is failing. Notify Dr Crusher. Can we reach transport range without entering Cardassian territory? We need to boost the confinement beam by seven percent. Mr La Forge? I'm on it, Captain. Try that. The pod is too far away. I'll augment the frequency spread. There are passengers, humanoid. Attempting identification. No one told you to do that, Ensign. Let's just get him aboard. There. That should do it. Confinement beam is at 109 percent of normal. Transporter room, you should be able to get a lock. Dr Crusher, are you ready? Stand by. Alyssa, you have to leave now. Alright, Doctor. Transporter room, go ahead. Aye, sir. What are you doing here? I'm not supposed to let anyone but senior officers in. Do you know what's going on? No. Do you? I'd better go. Ensign. Sir. 1200 hours. Alpha shift is relieved. Excuse me, sir. I'd like to stay on. I could use the training. Now's not the best time. Yes, sir. Ensign, you're with me. Bridge. You are a certified pilot, Ensign? Yes, sir. How long have you served on the Enterprise? Seven months, sir. You've been recommended for ops. You think you are up to it? I do. I'm not sure. I'm concerned about your record. Sir? The incident you were involved in at the Academy. With all due respect, that was three years ago. Doesn't matter how long ago it was. Would you do that again? I can assure you, sir, that I would never jeopardise lives by participating in... A daredevil stunt? I would certainly hope not. What concerns me is you participated in a cover-up that impeded an investigation into the death of a cadet. Sir, I should have told the truth... Yes, you should, but you didn't. Instead, you joined with the others to pretend it was simply an accident. What do you think that tells me about your character? Sir, if you had any idea what it was like after that incident... I didn't have any friends. I didn't have anyone to talk to. I took my test with the instructor because no one would be my partner. It would have been easier to just walk away, but I didn't. I stuck with it. Doesn't that say something about my character, too? I'm very sorry you didn't enjoy your time at the Academy, Ensign. As far as I am concerned, you should have been expelled. Quite frankly, I don't know how you made it on board this ship. You're dismissed. Another two seconds... OK, that's enough. Sir, I'm a little puzzled. Why are we intentionally damaging the shuttlecraft? We're evaluating hull resiliency. Starfleet requires periodic testing. I see. I don't believe I'm familiar with that requirement. Probably because you're not a senior officer. If you wish, I could fire bursts that would not harm the hull. The test would not be affected. It's fine the way it is. Now, give me another burst, about four seconds, right here. Do you want me to fire from this position? Actually, do it from over here. That would be consistent. Consistent with what? With making it appear that this shuttle had fled an attack. What makes you think that's what we're doing? The pattern is similar to what might result if it had fled an attacker while engaging in evasive manoeuvres. It's an amazing coincidence. Yes, sir. It is indeed. Shall we proceed with the testing? Yes. Thank you. Thank you for coming so quickly. We have to prepare for surgery on a subdural haematoma. Do not discuss what you see. I understand. We'll need to synthesise a litre of Cardassian blood. It's your bet, Taurik. I can't understand why we're sitting close to the Cardassian border. Must have something to do with that escape pod. Don't you think, Sito? Maybe. I wonder who was in it. You know what I heard? It was Ambassador Spock. That is unlikely. That's what I was told. By whom? I can't say. They beamed whoever was in it to sickbay. Did you see anything? No. Dr Crusher asked me to do the laboratory schedule. I thought Lt Powell was joining us tonight. He had to do a double shift. Too bad. He's the worst poker player I've met. Your bet, Sam. 20. I saw Powell with another woman. The way they talked made me wonder. If he's seeing someone else, he should tell Alyssa. It'll hurt her now, but it's better in the long run. I've been meaning to talk to you. I don't think Sito's prepared for the ops position. I must say, I disagree, sir. Counsellor, pair of fours bets. I'm listening. The bet is 50. It would be illogical to deny you a promotion for something you did as a cadet. He said I don't have character. What did you say? What could I say? Maybe he's right. You're a damn fine officer. You deserve that post. One thing's for sure. I won't get it if it's up to Riker. It is your decision. But if you give Sito a chance, she will not disappoint you. Very well. I'll take her under consideration. I'm not convinced about Lavelle. Why? He's too eager to please, always trying to ingratiate himself to me. Why assume it's to get the job? 50. There's your 50, and 100 more. I don't know. It seems to me you and Lavelle are alike. What? We're not at all alike. You're bluffing. You think so? Yes. I won't let you get away with it. Sam, maybe you shouldn't try so hard with Riker. It doesn't matter if he likes you, as long as he respects you. He must, or he would not be considering you. You're probably right. Maybe I tell myself that he hates me so that if I'm not promoted, I have an excuse. Are you in or not? At this juncture, the odds of my winning this hand are less than 39-1. I fold. The Commander's flush is still working. No help, Worf. Tens and deuces for the Doctor. Jacks and fours for the Counsellor. Three sixes. Fold. Looks like it's you and me. Gonna go another 50? Give me a second. Didn't you take up poker to be in the officers' game at the Potemkin? I happen to like poker. But your senior officers might have thought that you were trying to ingratiate yourself. I guess it's lucky they realised you were young and inexperienced and decided not to hold it against you. Maybe I have been hard on Lavelle. I do not believe he is bluffing. I do. There you go. What have you got? Flush. I cannot believe this! I am your worst nightmare. I knew it. How could you tell I was bluffing? You don't expect me to answer that? It's late. Maybe we should get some sleep. One more hand. Uh-uh. Don't quit just because I'm unbeatable. There's something I need to do in Engineering. I'll get you next time. I'll be there. Goodnight, everybody. Goodnight. Bye. Goodnight. See you later. What I find curious is that when Cmdr La Forge saw that my technique was more efficient, he seemed annoyed. Of course he was. You knew something he didn't. Do you think I have irreparably damaged my relationship with him? Depends what kind of a guy he is. Ante up, gentlemen. Come in. Commander. I just dropped by to see Taurik. What can I do for you? I'm headed for Engineering to run those tests. Since you've worked on it, I thought you might give me a hand. I'd be pleased to, sir. Great. Let's go. How about blackjack? I've got to get some sleep. Be sharp tomorrow. Why? To get promoted, have more responsibility and have to get to sleep even earlier? Goodnight. Come in. Ben. What are you doing here? I cleaned out some junior officers. I thought I'd do the same here. You're welcome to try. Pull up a chair. Thanks. Dismissed. Ensign Sito. Yes, sir? I also teach an advanced class. I believe you may be ready to participate. Before you can join the group, you must pass the gik'tal. Gik'tal? Yes, an ancient Klingon ritual. It tests your knowledge of the Mok'bara. I should practise first. No practise. That is part of the ritual. The test must be unannounced. Can you see? No. Good. The gik'tal has begun. Defend yourself. You must anticipate my attack. Yes, sir. Defend yourself. Are you listening, Ensign? Yes, but... Defend yourself. You did not anticipate. How can I defend myself when I can't see? Stop making excuses. Replace the blindfold. No! It's not a fair test. Very good, Ensign. You have passed the challenge. What? By taking off the blindfold? It takes courage to say the test is unfair. One thing I don't understand. Doesn't gik'tal mean to the death? You speak Klingon. Sir, is there really such a thing as a gik'tal challenge? No, there is not. But perhaps next time you are judged unfairly, it will not take so many bruises for you to protest. All I've ever wanted is to make a career in Starfleet. I can't change what happened. No one can. All I can do is work hard and try to earn the respect of people. If you're not going to give me that chance, I request a transfer. If you want a more lenient commander, you won't find one. Permission to speak freely, sir. Please do. If you didn't want me, you should have said when I was assigned here. It's not your place to punish me for what I did. I've worked hard here. My record is exemplary. If you're going to judge me, judge for what I am now. Very well, Ensign. I will. It took courage to face me after what I said the other day. I didn't ask you here to assess your qualifications for the ops position. I don't understand, sir. I was harsh because I wanted to assess you for a very important mission. A mission that could put you in a situation that would be far more unnerving than a dressing-down by me. Can I ask what that is? Join the senior officers in the observation lounge at 0900 hours. Yes, sir. And, Ensign? I do know why you ended up on the Enterprise. I asked for you. I wanted to make sure you had a chance to redeem yourself. Thank you, sir. You wanted to see me, Doctor? Yes, Alyssa. I think you know how much I've come to depend upon you. I've recommended your promotion because your performance has been exemplary. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. But more than that, I've come to think of you as a friend. Someone I really care about. It's nice of you to say that. I feel the same way. So... You and Andrew Powell? Someone told you? Told me what? We were keeping it a secret until the promotions. Secret? He asked me to marry him. That's wonderful. I'm so relieved. I mean, happy. Please take a seat, Ensign. This is Joret Dal. He was in the escape pod that we retrieved. He is a member of the Cardassian military and a Federation operative. He has risked his life to bring us invaluable information about Cardassian strategic intentions. Information that could very well enhance the security of Bajor and other planets in this sector. Now, it is absolutely imperative that we return him safely to Cardassian space. It will not be easy. The border is heavily guarded. His ship was destroyed. He'll use our shuttle. If stopped, I will claim to have stolen it. We distressed the shuttle as if it had been fired upon. Joret will talk his way past the patrol. If I were alone, my chances of succeeding would be slim. But if I had a prisoner with me, a Bajoran terrorist, I would appear to be a bounty hunter. Border crossings of that nature are not uncommon. For a price, the patrol will look the other way. Once the shuttle is past the patrol, Joret will put you into an escape pod and return you. Since the pod is small, it's difficult to detect. We'll be waiting here. I understand, sir. Ensign, this is a dangerous mission. I'm not ordering you to take part. Then I volunteer, sir. Be certain you understand the risk you are taking. If you are captured... I'm Bajoran. No one knows better than I do what Cardassians do to their prisoners. I've made my decision. Very well. Report to sickbay. Dr Crusher will explain. Ensign Sito. I must ask you not to discuss this with anyone. Yes, sir. I didn't realise she would be so young. The Captain asked Dr Crusher to make it look like Joret mistreated me. We're all set here. Sir. I want you to know that I appreciate the fact that you had confidence in me. Good luck. I'll see you soon. We're approaching the border. It won't be long before we're detected. When they stop us, should I say anything? No. It should seem that I've broken your will. If you're asked questions, look at me as though you're afraid to answer. Can I ask you something? Why are you doing this, risking your life for Starfleet? I don't consider myself a traitor. All my life I've served in the military. Once, it was an institution dedicated to the security of Cardassia. Now it's just a platform for ambitious guls hoping to make their reputations in battle. If I help Starfleet deter even one pointless skirmish, I've served my purpose. I'm sick of war. My people need peace. I never thought I'd hear a Cardassian say something like that. I never thought a Bajoran would risk her life for a Cardassian. Patrol ships are moving in. We don't have much time. She must have left on that shuttle. Do you know where it went? Toward Cardassian space. The shuttle was damaged. Sam, can we talk about something else? Don't you care? Of course. But we have to accept the fact that we're not always told about everything aboard ship. We can tell each other what we know. Do you two know something? Sam, please. I can't believe this. We're friends. We're also Starfleet officers. I'm not allowed to talk about it. OK. I understand. I'd better get going. I got duty in half an hour. Captain's log, stardate 47566. 7. We have reached the coordinates in Federation space where Ensign Sito's escape pod was to have rendezvoused with us. However, we have been waiting for over 30 hours and there is no sign of her. Report. We completed a long-range scan. The pod isn't out there. It is possible that we are unable to distinguish the pod from the inorganic matter in space. Try narrowing the scan. See if you pick up bio signs. Sir, it would help if I knew what life signs to look for. You're scanning for Bajoran life signs. Yes, sir. Nothing yet. The pod is 32 hours overdue. Sir, I recommend we launch a probe to increase the range of our sweeps. Launching a probe into Cardassian space would be a treaty violation. Mr Worf, prepare a probe and launch when ready. Aye, sir. Probe launched. Sir, I am detecting debris 200,000 kilometres inside Cardassian space. Its mass and composition indicate it could be the remains of a Federation escape pod. Captain's log, supplemental. We have intercepted a Cardassian report stating that a Bajoran prisoner escaped her captor and was killed in an evacuation pod as she tried to leave Cardassian space. To all Starfleet personnel, this is the Captain. It is my sad duty to inform you that a member of the crew, Ensign Sito Jaxa, has been lost in the line of duty. She was the finest example of a Starfleet officer and a young woman of remarkable courage and strength of character. Her loss will be deeply felt by all who knew her. Picard out. Are you OK? I just got promoted. Congratulations. Thanks. It just doesn't feel right. For all I know, she was going to get the promotion instead of me. You shouldn't feel that way. She'd be happy for you. The best way to remember her would be to excel in your new position. We're proud of you. Excuse me, sir. I need to move this table. What? There's an empty seat over there. I appreciate what you're trying to do, but it is not appropriate. You were her friends. I was only her commanding officer. Sir, I happen to know that she considered you a friend. "
S7E16,"Bridge Officer's log, stardate 47611.2. Dr Beverly Crusher reporting. We have rendezvoused with Troi's shuttlecraft. She has just returned from a class reunion on Starbase 231. Send a message to Cmdr Data and inform him of our delay. Aye, sir. Deanna, welcome back. Thank you. I was just reporting in. I didn't expect anyone to be up but Data. Data's away on assignment. A Federation deep-space probe went off course and crashed on Barkon IV. Some of the material was radioactive, so Data was sent to recover it before contamination spread. Isn't Barkon IV inhabited? Yes. It's a pre-industrial society. But the probe crashed 100 kilometres from any settlement, so Data shouldn't have any contact with the Barkonians. So, how was the reunion? Fine. It was good to see some old friends. I'd lost touch with most of them. It's interesting to see the different paths some of their lives have taken. Beverly, you don't usually watch the bridge, even when Data's not here. I volunteered tonight. I like to put in a little bridge time now and then, stay on top of operations, technical procedures. The truth is, I like it. Not every doctor gets to command a starship, even if it is night shift. May I ask you a personal question? Why did you decide to become Commander? I mean, you don't need the rank in order to be Chief Medical Officer. So, why put yourself through all the extra work? I don't know. I never used to think about rank. It seemed trivial compared to being a doctor. But then, about eight years ago, I started to feel like I wanted to stretch myself a little. Commander, there's no response from Cmdr Data. Continue sending him updates on our schedule. Aye, sir. Is something wrong? No. I wanted to tell Data there's a few days' delay in picking him up. We have orders to take some medical supplies to the Taranko colony. But he's not responding? Geordi said the probe's radiation might interfere with communications. I just thought I'd try anyway. So when you return from school, I'll be with the village elders. Again? Gia. I know, you're the town magistrate and you have a lot of work to do, but it seems you're always in some meeting or... Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Gia, go home. Now! Who are you? What do you want? Who are you? Wha... What do you want? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? There's nothing wrong with me. Who are you? What is your name? Can you understand me? My name is Garvin. My name... ...is Garvin. I thought I told you to go home. I know. I... ...do not know my name. What? You asked if I knew my name. I do not. At least you seem to be understanding a little more. Yes. It is becoming easier. Ask him where he's from, Father. Gia, go on to school. I'll deal with the stranger. Yes, Father. Goodbye. Goodbye. Your eyes and skin look so strange. Your clothes, you look like you've been in some kind of accident. I do not remember being in an accident. What do you remember? I walked here. From the mountains. The mountains? The mountains are over 200 seltons from here. I have a clear memory of my journey. What do you remember before that? I have no prior memory. Do you know what that is? No. May I? May I have it? Yes. There might be something in here that can tell us who you are. I wonder what these markings mean. Radioactive. What? It is written on the container. You can read this language? Evidently. Radioactive. What does that mean? I do not know. Perhaps it is my name. I never heard a name like that. You must come from a very distant place. Is that supposed to be a question? Because if you're asking me if I like it, then yes. This is a better way of communicating for you. It's less confusing than the way you speak. I knew I could count on the ship's Counsellor to boost my self-image! I'm glad to be of service. Did you want something, or just general Riker-bashing? I wanted to ask your opinion about something. I'm thinking of taking the bridge officer's test, becoming a commander. What brought this up? A lot of things. Working on the personnel review last month, talking to Beverly about her experiences, going to my class reunion. The class reunion. You saw a few old friends who had taken the test? Alright, I admit it was a catalyst. But I've been thinking about this off and on for the past two years. Why two years? Remember when we hit that quantum filament and I was in command on the bridge? I do. When that happened, I was overwhelmed. But when it was over, I realised that a part of me missed it. Not the actual disaster, but the experience of being in command. I felt like I was exploring a whole new side of myself. I don't want to give up counselling, but just stretch myself a little. Deanna, if you take the bridge officer's test, you'll have my full support. But as First Officer, I'll be the one judging you, and I'm a tough judge. And I'm a good student. We'll start tomorrow morning. 0800 hours. Remarkable set of teeth. Breath smells like... It doesn't have any smell actually. You can close your mouth. Let's see. Heartbeat sounds a little odd, but seems very regular. Skin feels... clammy, but you say you feel fine? That is correct. Headaches, palpitations, sluggishness, indigestion? No. But I cannot have indigestion since I have not eaten. Malnutrition. You should eat something to build your strength and return your vitality. Lots of meat, butter, cheese for a start. What about his eyes and his skin? They're so odd. Quite so. My grandmother would have called our friend a demon or a spirit or some sort of monster. But current scientific methodology allows us to dismiss superstitions and concentrate on scientific reality. Then what do you believe I am? You are an ice man. Ice man? Yes. You probably come from a race who lived in the ice of the Vellorian mountains. Your skin and eye colour are a result of prolonged exposure to harsh winter conditions. Then I am not ill? Aside from your memory loss, you do not seem to have symptoms of any illness I am familiar with. No. You are an ice man. Now, get something to eat and a good night's rest, and I'll come back tomorrow and see if your memory has begun to return. Thank you. Hello, Gia. Hello. What did Talar say about him? Is he sick? Not exactly. She said he's lost his memory but seems fine otherwise. Talar thinks he's from a race in the mountains. I am an ice man. We'll have to call you something else until your memory returns. What was the word on the container? Radioactive. Mr Radioactive. I don't like that name. Let's call him... Jayden. What do you think of that? Jayden. That is acceptable. Now, we need to clean him and get him something to wear. Run upstairs and get some of my old clothes. Yes, Father. I wonder if Skoran can tell us something about this metal of yours. You, ice man! Where'd you find this? I do not know. I told you, he's lost his memory. We're calling him Jayden for now. Jayden, huh? The metal is slightly warm. All the fragments are like that. It's obviously been tempered and milled. The lustrous quality of the metal is so pure. This wasn't made in any forge that I've ever seen. Will you sell them? Do you want them? It's malleable enough to make jewellery. They belong to Jayden. Do you want to sell them? You will need money. You may be right. But I do not wish to sell all the fragments. They may provide a clue to my identity. I'll give you 20 doraks for half the lot. Agreed. My leg! Get it off! Get it off! We need a lever! It'll be alright. Don't struggle. Jayden. Put it down. I believe the support structure on the anvil collapsed because some of the wood had rotted. Did I do something wrong, Garvin? No. Just unexpected. It's perfectly understandable. Your people probably all have great strength, to fight off the ferocious creatures that live in the Vellorian mountains. You told me that no one from the village has been to the mountains. How do you know there are ferocious creatures there? It's a well-known fact. But no one has actually seen one? Well, not to my knowledge, but... Father, are you alright? I've been tired since this afternoon. I'm sure it's nothing. You feel slightly warm. Fresh air and a brisk walk will do you good. That sounds like a good idea. I'll be back soon. You didn't like it? I neither liked it nor disliked it. I simply had no appetite. Father's cooking isn't as good as Mother's. He tries, though. Where is your mother? She died about a year ago. Father said she... ...she went to a beautiful place... ...where everything is peaceful and everyone loves each other... ...and no one ever gets sick. Do you think there is a place like that? Yes. I do. We lost contact with everything above deck 21, including the bridge. There's something wrong with one of the antimatter-containment units. Switch to auxiliary control. Auxiliary control is not on line. We are losing containment on the antimatter unit three. Alright. Switch the EM power inverter to the lateral... No, wait! Use the neodyne relay. Commander, the relay isn't holding. Containment failure in ten seconds. Computer, emergency procedure. Eject antimatter unit three. Authorisation Troi Omega Omega 31. Unable to comply. Power to ejection systems has been terminated. Commander, the unit's... Congratulations. You just destroyed the Enterprise. Thank you for the encouragement! Don't feel bad. You passed the rest, diplomatic law, first contact procedure, bridge operations. Engineering's the toughest part of the test. So, what did I do wrong? I'm afraid I can't tell you that. Why not? What kind of test is this? The kind you have to take again if you want to be a bridge officer! Only next time, the problem won't be so easy. So I suggest you study your emergency procedures. How can I, if you won't tell me what I did wrong? I don't know. I'm afraid I can't tell you that either. Rock, fire, sky and water are the basic elements of the universe. They can be found in every object, animal, person, everything. The rock in this wood can be felt by its weight and hardness. If we expose the wood to flame, we can encourage the fire within the wood to show itself. We can also see smoke... ...which is a part of the sky. The water in wood is difficult to see. Sometimes the elements are buried deep within objects, but the four elements are always there. Yes, Jayden? I do not believe that is correct. Oh? I believe you are reasoning by analogy, classifying things according to superficial observation rather than empirical evidence. Wood, for example, does not contain fire because it is combustible, nor does it contain rock because it is heavy. Wood, like any complex organic form, is composed of thousands of chemical compounds, none of which is fire. That will be enough, Jayden. As I told you, our friend Jayden has lost much of his memory, so I wouldn't put too much faith in any of his ideas. That is all for today. I will see you tomorrow. Practise your spelling and arithmetic tonight. Are you alright? Yes. But I do not agree with Talar's assessment. Although I do have gaps in my memory, I know that fire is not an element. That is not what you promised me! You're getting old. I offered you 15 for the metal and I gave it to you. We agreed on 20. Garvin is correct. You agreed on 20. Stay out of this, ice man! Your memory is not reliable. Father! Father, what's wrong? I don't know. I feel very weak suddenly. You have a fever. We should get him home. What's wrong with him? I suspect he... I don't know. I've never encountered anything like this before. These lesions look like burn marks. The fluids of his body have overheated. That would explain the fever and burning skin. Keep him cool, let plenty of fresh air into the house, and I want you to give him these herbs. That will bring his fluidic temperature down and allow this to pass. I understand. With an increased focal length and an achromatic objective lens, this instrument will have a higher effective magnification. I will come back tomorrow and check on you. Thank you. Garvin, with your permission, I would like to begin my own investigation into your illness. Go ahead. Gia, would you accompany me to the village? I will need some supplies. What are you going to do with all this? Make the laboratory equipment to research your father's illness. Do you think you can help him? I do not know. I must isolate the cause of the illness... There he is! It's his fault! No one was sick before he came to the village. Has Garvin's illness spread? That's right. And you're the cause. That's not true! Gia, I think we should leave. That's it. Leave. Get out of here. Go back to where you came from! Jayden, what are you doing? I'm studying skin samples from Gia and Garvin in an attempt to isolate the cause of the illness. Gia? Yes. She is also beginning to show signs of the illness. What is that? It is a magnifying device based on your handheld instrument. I have refined the design to increase magnification. May I? Of course. How strong is the magnification? Objects appear approximately 500 times their normal size. As you can see, the cellular damage is quite extensive. Based on interstitial transparency and membrane integrity, I do not believe it is an infection or a communicable disease. I see. At the moment, I am looking for a common event or experience that Gia, Garvin and Skoran may have shared that could have a causal relationship to their illness. They've lived here many years and have many common experiences. Yes. But since the illness struck all three in a short period of time, we must assume the experience is recent and unusual. Actually, Jayden, encountering you has been the most unusual experience they've shared recently. I am aware of that. Excuse me. I am also open to the possibility that I may be the causal factor. However, since you have had much contact with me and show no sign of sickness, I tend to discount myself. Still, it has to be more than just a coincidence that shortly after you arrived, people started to become ill. I agree. Jayden, I tried to give Father his broth, but he won't eat. You have a fever. You should be in bed. No, I'm alright. Father needs me. Talar is correct. You should rest. I will attend to your father. Gia, when did you begin wearing that pendant? Two days ago. Father bought it from Skoran. Why? May I see it? This is one of the metal fragments I sold to Skoran. The secondary plasma vent... ...has a triple redundant bypass. Which means that the primary access junction... ...is routed through... Come in. ...would be routed through the port transducer matrix. Come to give me more encouragement? No. I'm here to tell you that I've decided to cancel your test. What?! I'm cancelling the test. May I ask why? You've taken engineering three times. You're no closer to passing. Then I'll take it four times. Or 14 times. Or however many times it's necessary for me to get it right! Deanna... this is nothing personal. Not everyone is cut out to be a bridge officer. I don't think this is for you. Why? Because I'm not the most technically minded person on the ship? I may have trouble telling a plasma conduit from a phase inducer, but there's more to being a bridge officer than memorising manuals. There is. You could memorise all the manuals in the computer. I still don't think you'd pass. Tell me one thing, is there a solution? Or is this simply a test of my ability to handle a no-win situation? There is a solution. Then give me time to find it. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. I cannot let any bridge officer serve who's not qualified. I'm sorry. ""My first duty is to the ship."" The ship! Computer, load bridge officer's test, engineering qualification. Computer ready. Run program. The primary containment control system is not functioning. The conduit to the antimatter storage deck is severed. Geordi... ...could you repair the conduit if you went into the crawlspace? Sir, that crawlway is in a warp-plasma shaft. He would not survive the radiation. I know that. Geordi, could you repair the conduit? Yeah. I think I could. Then do it. That's an order. End simulation. Something told me you wouldn't let this go. Congratulations. You passed. That's what this was about, to see if I'd order someone to their death. That's right. That was part of being in command I thought I'd prepared for. But when the moment came, I hesitated. Maybe you were right, maybe I'm not cut out for this. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options and then you made the hard choice. Come on. Let's get out of here, Commander. I have coated this piece of cloth with the liquid used in lamps. The cloth becomes luminescent when it is exposed to an energy source. This pendant also appears to be an energy source. But... where is this pattern of light coming from? I believe a stream of particles is emanating from the metallic pendant and hitting the cloth. I don't see particles coming from the pendant. You will see there are. I can even block them. It would appear that this container was constructed of a material which blocks the particles coming from the metal. It's a trick. No. It is empirical data. I believe the fragments were placed in this container to protect people from accidental exposure. The word ""radioactive"" may be a warning about the dangerous metal. Alright. Let's say for the moment you are right, that there are particles coming from the metal. What should we do? I will continue my experiment. I want you to gather all the pieces of metal in the village and place them in this container. Alright. But when I return, I want a thorough explanation of all this. And I want to examine your data, in detail. Of course. There you are! You're the cause of this, ice man! If you refer to the illness, you are partially correct. But it is more complex than that. The metal fragment... What... what are you? I do not know. I saw it with my own eyes. He's some kind of creature. It's not true, Father. We must fight him. And stop him before he kills us all. I don't... Not Jayden. He wouldn't try to hurt us. Come on! Let him rest for now. You should rest as well. Exerting yourself will only make you sicker. I'll be back. Gia. Jayden! Everyone's looking for you. Skoran said... you're some kind of... creature. I do not know... what I am. But I am not like you. I know. You are an ice man. We talked about that. No. I am not. Jayden, why are you wearing that hood? I do not wish to frighten you. I won't be afraid. Take it off. Please. I have to see. I understand your reaction. But I do not wish to harm you. You or Garvin or anyone else. I only wish to help, to find a cure for the illness. I was very close. I must continue my work, but it will take time. How long until Skoran and the others return? I don't know. They're looking for you now. Then I must hurry. Gia... I believe I have found the answer. You think you've found a cure? I believe so. I tested this medicine on skin samples from your father. They showed improvement, so I administered this to him. He is now recovering. What kind of medicine is it? A compound which will neutralise the particles that are making you ill. Swallow this. I must administer this to everyone in the village, but they do not trust me after what happened to Skoran. I could tell them. I am afraid they will not believe you, either. Is the well in the town square the only source of water in the town? Well? This is very important. Are there any sources of fresh water near the village? No. The nearest river... ...is two days away. Then I will put this compound into the well water. It may be diluted, but it should still have enough potency to work. Compound... There he is! You see? It's just as I said. I only wish to help. This is how you helped us, by bringing this plague? Trying to kill us all? Well, you won't succeed! I won't let you! Excuse me. We're looking for a friend of ours. He might have wandered into your village a few days ago. You'd remember him. He would have seemed strange. Pale skin, gold eyes. He was your friend? Yes, do you know him? Where is he? I don't understand. We didn't know his real name, so we called him Jayden. He's dead? They killed him because they were afraid of him, but he saved us from sickness. The sickness? There were these pieces of metal. They made everyone sick. But Jayden put something in the water and now everyone's better. What happened to the metal? We buried them in the forest. What was his real name? Data. Data. He was my friend, too. It's Data, alright. He's buried about two metres down. He's been deactivated so I can't assess the damage. We could beam him and the probe fragments onto the ship. No one would know. Positronic net on line. Subprocessor relays in place. Neuroelectrical systems enabled. Data! Are you alright? I do not know. I am surprised to find myself here. I thought I was on Barkon IV. What's the last thing you remember? I had located the crashed Federation probe and collected the radioactive fragments, I was attempting to download the sensor logs from the probe computer. There was a power surge. I believe the surge overloaded my positronic matrix. After that, I have no memory until this moment. It appears I had an interesting time. We don't know much either. Apparently, you saved an entire village from radiation poisoning. And were a very special friend to a little girl. Well, if you'll excuse me, I have the bridge this watch. Counsellor, have you been promoted in my absence? That's right. Which means from now on you can call me ""sir."" Yes, sir. "
S7E17,"That's very good. Well, that's very nice. No, it isn't. I just can't get it right. Do you think the wings are too big? No, not at all. Birds have wings of all sizes, Eric. You shouldn't worry about making it perfect. Mrs Narsu said we should make our sculptures as realistic as possible. She's right. It is important to make the clay take the shape you want it to have. But you're not to concentrate on technique today. I'm here to help you focus on the feelings you want to convey. For instance, what do you think about when you see a bird? Flying? Fine. So, make your sculpture make me think of flying, too. How's it going, Data? I have finished. The dimensions are accurate to within 1.3 percent. I'm sure they are. Data, you don't have a problem with realism. But you're here to work on your imagination. Maybe you should try something a little more abstract. Here. I want you to start a new piece. I'd like you to sculpt... ...music. Counsellor, music is a collection of acoustic vibrations. How can I reproduce a sound with clay? Think of the effects that sounds have on people, the images that music brings to your mind, and then give it a form. It's a start. Riker to Data. Please report to the bridge. Acknowledged, sir. On my way. Captain's log, stardate 47615.2. We have encountered a rogue comet in Sector 1156. It is not native to this region and there is no record of this object on Federation charts. Based on its trajectory, the comet appears to have originated in the D'Arsay system. That's over two sectors away. Correct, sir. This object has been en route for 87 million years. That's a long time, alone in the dark. Begin a full sensor analysis, Mr Data, and log the findings with the Federation Astrophysical Survey. Aye, sir. The outer shell is composed primarily of gaseous hydrogen and helium surrounding an icy mantle. The inner core consists of heavier elements... What was that? There is a distortion in the core. I believe we experienced an intense sensor echo. Can you correct for it? I am attempting to do so. I have compensated for the effect. Sensors are reconfigured. We are picking up interference but the distortion is manageable. At these settings, the scan will be complete in 39 hours. Worf says he'll teach us Mok'bara throwing techniques today. More like falling techniques. Last time, I was sore for a week. What's this? I have no idea. I've never seen it before. Maybe Will left it. It's not quite his style. Maybe it's a secret admirer. That's an interesting thought. Figure it out later. Come on, we're gonna be late. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. That's nice. Data, this is amazing. How did you come up with this? I followed your advice, Counsellor. I used my imagination. That's an understatement. For some reason, as I was shaping the clay, the image of the mask was exceptionally clear in my mind. The design seemed to flow naturally. Have you been in my quarters? No, Counsellor. Someone left an object in my room. Some kind of artefact. It has something very similar to this. You don't know anything? I do not. Excuse me, Counsellor. Can you help me with my terminal? It's not working right. Perhaps we should investigate this matter further. The symbols don't match anything in the linguistics banks. Some alien information has been downloaded into our computer core. I don't know how, but it's reconfiguring our systems. How did it get in? I traced it to the sensor array. The sensors? They've been scanning that comet for 18 hours. Those energy readings from the comet. That sensor echo. We don't know what's inside. It's time we found out. Could we use phasers to melt down the shell of the comet? A dispersed wide-field beam might do the trick. We'll work out the firing parameters. What do you think, Data? What's wrong? I believe I recognise these symbols. How? I do not know. You think your systems have been affected? It is a possibility. I do not believe my systems are impaired. But I will run a full diagnostic to make certain. What do you think they mean? Boundary. Border. Road. Companion. Message. Messenger. What's that one? Death. Captain, phasers are set for wide dispersal. Ten percent maximum power. The beam will terminate once the core is reached. Very well, Mr Worf. Fire. Phasers have terminated. Mr Data, what are we looking at? Is it a ship? I do not know, sir. The object is nearly solid. It is composed primarily of fortanium and several unknown materials. It is over 87 million years old. That's older than the comet. Could someone from the system have built it? There are no technologically advanced cultures in that system now. But perhaps, 87 million years ago, there were. Why would they hide something like that inside a comet? Possibly, it accumulated those frozen gases over time as it travelled through space. In any case, it's responsible for our system anomalies. They're using our sensor beam to transmit information into our computers and replicators. But the question remains, what is its purpose? Captain, I believe this object is an informational archive. Why do you say that? I do not know. However, I seem to have an intuitive understanding of its function. Data, the internal structure is pretty complex. Its repetitive node configuration might suggest a database. But it could be anything. I don't see how you can know for sure what it is. Do you believe you are in communication with that object? It is a possibility, sir. I recommend a level-one diagnostic of my positronic net to determine if that is the case. Very well. Mr La Forge, give him a hand. Do you think it's just making contact? It's possible. But if that is an archive from an ancient civilisation, we should allow it to do so. But we must be careful. Mr Worf, keep an eye on the sensors. Any danger, sever the connection. Aye, sir. Come. Captain? Come in, Number One. We've confined the system corruption. It won't spread any further. But we still have alien symbols floating around on our computer. This is quite a collection. I've seen these all over the ship. They all look the same. Primitive and non-functional. Ceremonial and deceptively primitive. Only an advanced society could have built that object out there. These artefacts played a ritualistic role in that society, I think. Do you think Data could be right? Could this be some alien library? It's possible. If so, it's a find of enormous significance. That library seems designed to do so much more than store information. Who knows what we might learn from this? I keep seeing this design. It is of particular significance. What could it mean? The concept of compass directions is common in many cultures. The words that Data recognised, boundary, border, road, they were arranged in this design. Perhaps the artefacts that have this compass symbol belong to the same theme, movement. Finding a direction, travelling a path, crossing a boundary. And death? One of the symbols was death. The ultimate boundary. I've seen this symbol everywhere, too, but much less prominently displayed. It's always in the background, smaller than the others. What does it represent? I have no idea. Lower synaptic functions are completely normal. Autonomous systems all check out. Examine my memory subsystem next. Alright. Data, what's wrong? I am not certain. I am experiencing a curious sensation. What is it? An impulse. Impulse? What kind of impulse? I do not know. I'll check your higher functions. Geordi. What does it feel like when a person is losing his mind? Come on, you're scaring me. What's going on? I do not know. I am different. Well, you're gonna be alright. You're with me, OK? OK. Listen. I'm gonna disconnect you. What's going on? Masaka is waking. Captain... Captain. I've been waiting for you. You should feel honoured. I don't usually wait for anyone. What is it you want? Masaka is waking. Are you Masaka? I am not Masaka! I am lhat. What have you done to Cmdr Data? Cmdr Data? You mean the one who was here? Yes. He's gone. Who can say where? Picard to Counsellor Troi. Report to Main Engineering. ""Picard to Counsellor Troi. Report to Main Engineering."" lhat, this place you come from, is it a cultural archive of your species? I come from Masaka City. Are there others like you there? There are no others like me. Who is Masaka? You will find out. I would like to know Masaka, speak with her. Do you understand pain? Death? That is all you need to know of Masaka. It is what she is. Go. Leave this place before she finds you. It can be done. I did it. Masaka. I am yours. Every part of me is yours. We should confine him to quarters. This is a micrograph of what's happened to Data's positronic net. As near as I can tell, these are behavioural nodes. I counted 14. The archive is using Data to create different people within its culture, as it used our replicators to create artefacts. Data's real personality has been completely buried. In a sense, Data has the android equivalent of multiple personalities. The archive hasn't stopped yet. Data's net is still being transformed. There's no telling how many more personalities might emerge. Continue to scan the archive. See if you can find some way to access it. In the meantime, I'll see what I can learn from these people inside Data. I'm not going to hurt you. Only Masaka can hurt me. I am for her alone. I need to speak with lhat. Do you understand? lhat. Captain. That was a cruel joke you played on me. For a moment, a brief moment... ...I actually thought that woman was Masaka. Whoever took your place wasn't afraid. He seemed eager for his fate. Pitiful, isn't it? You won't catch me humiliating myself for a woman, even a queen. Then Masaka is your queen. She's a lazy creature. She spends most of her time sleeping. The problem is, what she does when she's awake. Then we should keep her asleep. Try to stop the sun from climbing the sky? Only Korgano can do that, and he's not here. Where is he? Help me. Please. What's wrong? I'm afraid. Of what? Her. Masaka? Her! Picard to bridge. Report. The archive activated a tractor beam. We can't disengage it. Has there been any damage? There was an emergency in ten-forward. Captain, there's an energy pulse in the tractor beam. It's overriding our systems. I'll be there. Don't leave me. I won't leave. Please, let go of me. Does it hurt? Yes. She's gonna hurt us all. Now you've done it, Captain. Masaka is awake. Who's this? I'd say that that is Masaka. lhat referred to her as queen. It's not unusual in ceremonial cultures to find royalty symbolised by a sun. You said the personalities were in awe of her, even terrified. According to Data, the sun image is also a symbol for death. There it is again. The same U-shaped symbol, small and insignificant. Almost as if it's an afterthought. Captain. This is incredible. These weren't beamed here from the archives. The matter here in ten-forward has been transformed. Into living plants. How? I'm not sure. But bit by bit, this ship is being transformed. We have been receiving reports from the rest of the ship. Part of deck 12 is now an aqueduct. What are we being transformed into? I'm not sure I want to find out. I don't think we have any choice. We must destroy that archive. Our weapons' control systems are inoperative. However, we could reconfigure a photon torpedo for a manual launch. Make it so. There's so much we could have learned. I really regret losing that opportunity. I've locked in the parameters. What's the phase alignment now? Less than 0.7 percent. Good, that will do it. I'm sending... Sir. The onboard power systems are not functioning. Let's see what's going on here. Something tells me we'd better get out of here. Engineering to bridge. Emergency transport, two to beam out. We'd better talk here. The observation lounge has turned into a swamp. So, what's our status? So far, the archive has transformed 20 percent of the ship. We've lost propulsion and weapon systems. Communications, sensors, life-support? We have communications and sensors. Life-support is unaffected. I've analysed the alien plant forms. They've developed from biological matter on the ship. The stone artefacts are made in much the same way, extrapolating from the ship's alloys. The archive can transform molecular structure, including DNA, into anything it wants. So it's using our ship, our alloys, our DNA, to create elements of its own culture. But why? What does the archive hope to accomplish? Whatever the intent that lies behind its process, I won't permit this ship to become an alien city. Mr La Forge, any ideas? We still haven't cut off that beam, but I have accessed the archive with an energy pulse. If I locate the transformation program, I could control it. That's a good idea, but I feel that the answer lies there. With Masaka. We must find her, access her. Talk to her. Hello. Difficult to stay warm. It's not warm enough, not for an old man. Tell me about Masaka. My daughter. Tell me, can I talk to her? Children grow. Forget their parents. No. Only Korgano can talk to Masaka. Korgano? Who is that? Well, aren't we the persistent one? lhat. Is anyone else so charming? Masaka is taking over my ship. I told you she would. I want to talk with her. But I understand that Korgano is the only one who can do that. Who told you that? An old man. Masaka's father. Yes. Legend has it she chopped him up and used his bones to make the world. Any wonder he won't talk about her? How can I find Korgano? I don't know. He's not chasing her any more. Where has he gone? Stop asking me questions. I got away from her once. I don't want her to find me. I'll wind up on her sacrificial slab. lhat, if she's looking for a sacrifice, she can take me. Perhaps then, she'll stop looking for you. Well, there's an idea. Better you than me. Very well. What do we do? You must build Masaka's temple. The Queen's temple. That will get her attention. Very well. How? You need the sign. I could give it to you, so could the old man. But just try getting it from him. Give me the sign. If she finds out... ...you can't imagine her rage. She lets people die of thirst. A terrible death. Sometimes, she burns them alive. She is glorious. lhat, the sign. Give it to me. If she comes, you will take my place? Yes. Quickly. Give me your hand. A line as the unending horizon. A curve as... She has found me. Masaka. Show yourself. I will go with you. It seems I was not fast enough. So hard to stay warm. Are you one of my children? I can't remember any more. I need your help. I need the sign for Masaka's temple. It won't help you. Korgano no longer pursues her. Only he can stop her. A line as the unending horizon. A curve as... A line as the unending horizon. A curve... ...as the rolling hillside. A point as a distant bird. A ray as the rising sun. Thank you. Now... Come sit with me. Tend the fire. I'm alone. No one left to help me. She's coming. Are all the others dead? Did Masaka kill them? No. She sent them away. It will take them days to die. Any progress, Mr La Forge? I think I've found the transformation program. Will it accept the symbol? I think so. I've isolated the input pathways. They're keyed to accept symbols. If I input this one, it should initiate the program. And create the temple? I hope so. If this is the wrong symbol, it might turn us into a chunk of rock. The question is, can we trust a personality from an alien archive that seems bent on taking us over? lhat risked his life to show me that symbol. Masaka killed him for doing it. I think we have to risk it. The deck has been cleared of personnel. We may proceed. Cmdr Riker, we're ready. Understood. Initiate transformation. Inputting the symbol now. It would seem that this is Masaka's temple. There is no one else here. lhat said that if we created the temple, then it would get her attention. It may be some time before she shows herself. How will she do that? I don't know. Captain. Take a look at this. This is the first time I've seen these two symbols paired. That could be significant. Look, there it is again. And again. And there again. This is obviously an important pairing. ""He isn't chasing her any more."" Sir? lhat said that someone called Korgano isn't chasing Masaka any more. And the old man said, ""He pursues her no longer."" In a sense, the small symbol might be seen to be chasing Masaka. The symbol suggests antlers of some kind. Horns. Maybe it is meant to represent an animal. Animals are worshipped in many cultures. That smaller symbol could represent Korgano. lhat and the old man said Korgano was the only one who could control Masaka. Many ritualistic cultures incorporate the idea of balance into their belief systems. Now, Masaka is a queen. A powerful, godlike figure. It's not unrealistic to believe that she might have a counterpart, a consort. Look around, see if you can see that horn-like symbol anywhere else. This is the most prominent instance of the horn symbol. Now it appears as though Masaka's sun is chasing it. The sun chasing an animal? Maybe it's simpler. Maybe their relationship is more like the sun and the moon. I see. Masaka and Korgano, switching positions. The sun setting, the moon rising. Exactly. Like two powerful rulers changing places in a continual cycle. And like the sun and the moon, only one can be in ascendance. If we can find Korgano in the archive and bring him out, then perhaps he could force Masaka to leave. But would we be better off with him? lhat and the others didn't seem to be frightened of Korgano. Sir. Masaka. I am Capt Picard of the Federation... Go away! Please, hear us. Your archive is destroying... I do not hear you. She will not even listen to us. Then we will find someone to whom she will listen. I've found it, Captain. This is the only place where Korgano's moon symbol appears by itself, not linked with Masaka's. I want you to access the transformation program. When you're ready, input the symbol. Isn't that risky? What will the result be? The symbol might generate Korgano's temple or Korgano himself. In one sense, Korgano is Masaka's nemesis. Whatever this symbol represents, it could be a means to control her. If anyone has a better idea, I will entertain it. I've accessed the program. Initiate the transformation. Another mask. You know, we could be going about this the wrong way. This is a ritualistic culture based on symbol and myth. Perhaps we should try to confront them on those terms. If I could incorporate myself in their ritual... ...then perhaps Masaka would listen to me. You're going to pose as Korgano? We know so little about this culture, and even less about Korgano. How would you convince Masaka that you're him? I'm really not certain. But there are similarities between this culture and others I've studied. I would imagine I'll improvise. What's our status? We have less than two hours before there is nothing left of the ship. At least, nothing we can recognise. Masaka. Korgano. Are you surprised to see me? I thought I had escaped you. You should know that is impossible. You are a fine hunter. But I am a powerful prey. You will never catch me. Do you want to be the prey forever? I thought I was alone. I thought I would not have to share the sky with you. But without me, you are not complete. I know you so well. You live for the chase, as do I. Will you not miss being the hunter, pursuing me, forcing me from the sky, so that you can rise again? You know me well, Korgano. I think that you are beginning to tire. It is difficult, brightening the sky forever. I am getting sleepy. You always do that to me. So that you can wake with the dawn... ...and begin the hunt again. Let the hunt begin again. I am eager for that. As am I. Riker to Picard. It looks like everything's back to normal. Acknowledged. Mr Data, are you alright? I believe so, sir. I am not certain what has happened. Have I been dreaming again? I'm afraid that would take some time to explain. Captain's log, stardate 47618.4. Cmdr La Forge has disabled the alien transformation program. Starfleet has dispatched archaeologists to study the archive. I don't understand. All the alien artefacts disappeared. That one was not created by the archive, sir. That is the mask I originally made. I have painted it. A memento. Yes, sir. Although I am relieved to be rid of those alien personalities, in a sense, I am now empty. I can imagine. Dr Crusher told me that there were possibly dozens of personalities inside you. I suspect the number was greater. My impression was of thousands, of all ages and walks of life. It was a remarkable experience. Well, Data, you never may become fully human, but you've had an experience that transcends the human condition. You've been an entire civilisation. "
S7E18,"We are losing containment in the starboard nacelle tube. Get more power to the fuel coils. Aye, sir. Mr La Forge, report. I can't shut down the injectors. Someone's locked out the controls. The plasma-venting system has engaged. Two more decks. Bridge, we've almost reached the nacelle tube. Acknowledged. Release the hull plate. We may have to jettison the core. Aye, sir. What happened? He locked out the controls and stepped up onto the walkway. See if you can shut down the plasma flow. I'm afraid if we try to get closer, he'll jump through the force field. Dan, it's me. It's Will Riker. I was here yesterday, remember? I didn't want to do it. But I saw them. And they laughed at me. They laughed. Whatever happened, we can talk about it. I want to help. Stay away! I just want to see your face, that's all. So we can talk. I know what I have to do. Dan, no! I've unlocked the controls. Shutdown procedure initiated. There's still plasma in there. It'll take time to vent off. Tell me what happened. Maybe I can help. I know what I have to do. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. A few more seconds, I could have saved him. Commander, you did everything you could. It was not your fault. It was strange. I felt as if he didn't even recognise me, although I was with him the other day, supervising the refit. How was he then? Fine. I complimented him on getting the refit done faster than expected. He was pleased that I'd noticed. I met with him six weeks ago during crew evaluations. He was very positive. He was looking forward to going to the nacelle tube. He was a good officer with a fine career ahead of him. I don't understand why he wanted... In my years as a Starfleet captain, I've had to notify many parents of the loss of loved ones, but never before of a suicide. I would like to be able to offer Lt Kwan's parents some explanation of what happened, to help them make sense of this. Maybe he left a message of some kind, explaining why he did it. I'd like you two to piece together a picture of his last few days. If he made personal logs, it might help to look at them. You are authorised to do so. La Forge to Captain. Go ahead. I've finished my damage assessment. We can be under way within the hour. Mr la Forge, the medical situation on Barson II has worsened. We have permission to exceed warp-speed limitations to get on schedule. We can give you warp eight if we need it. Acknowledged. Geordi, would you agree that the instinct for self-preservation is shared by most life forms? I'd say it's the most basic instinct, Data. Then I find it difficult to understand why someone would deliberately terminate their own existence. I don't know, Data. Maybe Lt Kwan felt there was something wrong with his life, something he felt powerless to fix. I believe I understand. I have been in a similar situation. Really? The months after my activation were a difficult period for me. There were many problems to do with my becoming sentient. Because your neural net was still forming? As I acquired new skills, neural pathways would form, replacing other less complex pathways. It was very disorienting. I bet. As my systems grew in complexity, it was difficult to integrate new pathways into my existing neural net. The probability of cascade failure grew with each additional pathway. I concluded it would be safer, and easier, to shut myself down and start again. But then you wouldn't have remembered anything that happened to you. In a way, it would have been like committing suicide. So what did you do? I decided against the procedure. I chose to treat the problems I was having as challenges to overcome Not obstacles to be avoided. Great way to look at it, Data. I wish Lt Kwan had been able to look at his problems the same way. This is a Napean design. His mother's Napean. His father's human. It all looks so normal. For some reason, I half expected it to be a mess. It is strange to think that someone could have considered ending his life and yet give no outward sign. Just before he jumped, he seemed almost calm. He must have been in a lot of pain to do what he did. It could be that the prospect of ending the pain felt like a relief. This is Ensign Calloway, isn't it? Yes, she is a medical technician. It's always hard to lose someone you care about, but to lose them like this... We should check his personal logs. This is his last entry, made before going on duty this morning. Personal log, stardate 47622. 1. We finished the nacelle tube refit last night. After pulling two double shifts, I'm looking forward to spending time with Maddy. Ensign Calloway. That doesn't sound like a man planning to take his own life. No, it does not. I can't believe he's really gone. I keep thinking he'll show up and tell me there's been some terrible misunderstanding. I thought you'd like to know that in his personal logs, Dan talked about you a great deal. He loved you very much. If that's true, then how could he leave me like this? That's what I'm trying to find out. I know it's hard, but it would help if you could tell me about him. When was the last time you saw him? Two nights ago. We were planning our next shore leave together. Did he mention anything that might have upset him? No, not really. He did say something about work, about Lt Nara, but it wasn't serious. Nara. She's his superior in the nacelle tube? Yes. Dan sensed that she... Well, she felt threatened by him. She thought he was after her position. Was he prone to mood swings or depression? No, but he was very sensitive to other people's moods. He used to look at me and know what I was feeling. I always loved that about him. Well, Napeans are partially empathic. Maybe he inherited his mother's abilities. He teased me that when I met her, I wouldn't get away with anything. We knew each other for over two years, but we didn't get together until a few months ago. We took it slow. We thought we had all the time in the world. Something must have happened to him, Counsellor. Something terrible, because it's not like Dan to take his own life. I understand. Please find out what it was. Can I help you? I didn't see you there. You're Lt Nara, aren't you? Can I do something for you? I'm investigating Lt Kwan's death. I just wanted to look around. It's such a shame. He was a good man. Did you notice any change in his behaviour recently? No. I've been going over the last few days, trying to see if I... ...if I missed any warning signs. It's as if something inside him just snapped. How was his job performance? Excellent. He knew this ship better than most. He helped build it at Utopia Planitia. Did he get on with his co-workers? He was ambitious. He came in here with all sorts of new ideas, Some of them very good ideas. But not all? No. But after he settled in, we got along fine. Excuse me a minute. Feel free to look around. Where was Lt Kwan's station? Right there. Are you alright? I don't know. I don't know how to describe it. I was suddenly overwhelmed by a flood of emotions. Fear, rage, panic... They weren't coming from any person. They were just there, in the room. Whose emotions were they? You said you were alone. I was. I scanned the area. I found no anomalous readings. How could you be empathic in an empty room? I don't know. Could Lt Kwan being partially empathic have anything to do with it? What do you mean? I'm not sure. But the feelings Troi described are consistent with suicide. Could his death leave an empathic echo? I don't see how. But if I went back there, I might get a better sense of what I experienced. I don't think so. You're showing high levels of psilosynine. Psilosynine? A neurotransmitter involved in telepathy. The experience overwhelmed you the first time. Wait until your levels return to normal. How long? Three, maybe four hours. This time I want someone with you. I shall accompany you, Counsellor. Captain's log, stardate 47623.2. We've arrived at Starbase 328 on schedule. After taking aboard medical supplies, we will depart for Barson II. Come in. Hello, Worf. Counsellor. Have you found anything in Lt Kwan's logs? Everything I've read suggests he was well-adjusted and optimistic. It just doesn't make any sense. Can I get you anything? No, nothing. Yridian tea. I've been thinking about what happened to me in the nacelle tube. Whether it was an empathic echo, left by Kwan's death. Have your empathic experiences always involved the physical presence of another person? All the ones I'm sure of, yes. What do you mean, ""sure of?"" Well, when I was a little girl, my grandfather used to tell me stories by the fire. I would close my eyes and listen to his mind for hours on end. He told the stories telepathically? My grandfather rarely spoke. He said that was for off-worlders and people who didn't know any better. Now, the only time I can remember his stories is when I go home and sit by the fireplace. Sometimes, when I'm alone there, it's almost as if I can hear his voice inside my head. Yes. I, too, have sought visions in fire. I can't explain it, but it feels real to me. Just like what happened in the nacelle tube. There are things we do not understand. They exist, nonetheless. Perhaps I should let you get some rest. It's alright. No. If you will excuse me, Counsellor. Mr Worf. Commander. Two Til'amin froths, please. Yes, sir. Lt Corell seems to be enjoying your company. I'd like to think so. Are you involved with her? I'm not sure yet. Why, are you interested in her? No. But if I were, I would of course discuss the situation with you before proceeding further. I appreciate it but that wouldn't be necessary. I'd never come between you and someone you are involved with or had ever been involved with. Is there someone in particular you mean? No. Is there someone in particular you'd rather I not be involved with? Mr Worf, you sound like you're asking to date my sister! No, I was merely... Never mind. Excuse me, sir. Could you open this door for me? Yes, but only for a short time. After 90 seconds, the plasma-venting system engages to prevent degradation of the force field. I just want a quick look. May I ask what you're looking for? I'm not sure. Warning, plasma-venting system will engage in 90 seconds. No! No, no, please! Please, please! No, don't! No! Warning. Plasma-venting system will engage in 80 seconds. Worf? Counsellor, are you alright? Let's get out of here. Do you remember anything else? Yes, I think I do. There was a tool crate on the floor. It was labelled Utopia Planitia. The shipyard where the Enterprise was built. Clearly, this was more than an empathic echo. It seems you were seeing something that happened eight years ago. Everyone was looking directly at me. But it was as if I was seeing through someone else's eyes. Lt Kwan was partially empathic. Maybe you were seeing through his eyes. It's possible, but I don't see how it happened. Well, putting that aside, let's assume that, by some inexplicable phenomenon, you witnessed an event that occurred to Lt Kwan. Those faces you saw, did you recognise any of them? I've never seen the woman before. Or the man who was with her. But there was someone else there. A man... He was staring at me in the most peculiar way. I think he had reddish hair, and he did seem familiar to me. But it's all so hazy. It's like trying to remember a dream. There was a woman who was frightened. Then you saw her again, laughing, presumably at Lt Kwan. What does it all mean? I don't know. But something terrible happened there, I felt it. Look through the personnel files of Utopia Planitia. See if you recognise any of the faces. If only I could go back into the room without feeling overwhelmed. It might help me remember some relevant detail. I could give you an inhibitor to slow the production of psilosynine. That might suppress your empathic abilities and make the experience manageable. It would take about 16 hours to synthesise. I'd like to try that. Very well, Counsellor. I apologise for being late. The viral medicines we're taking to Barson II require special security measures to ensure they're contained. Have you found anything? No. There were thousands of people involved in building the Enterprise. Perhaps you should narrow the search parameters. I think I have. The man who looked familiar may have served on the Enterprise in the last seven years. I've limited the search to personnel who served at Utopia Planitia and on the Enterprise. Ensign Salvatore. He transferred over a year ago. Lt Ziff. She's in quantum mechanics. That's him. Lt Walter Pierce. I remember now. He came on board about six months ago. In Engineering. You were Lt Kwan's supervisor at Utopia Planitia? That's right. I was sorry to hear what happened. Were you ever in the nacelle control room while it was under construction? I worked all over the ship. In fact, I remember running a power conduit behind this wall here. Were you ever in the nacelle room at the same time as Lt Kwan? It was a long time ago. People were working everywhere. So you do not remember? I'm sorry. I don't. Do you recall if anything unusual happened there? How do you mean? An altercation, perhaps. Possibly involving Kwan. No. Nothing like that. As I remember, things went pretty smoothly. What's this all about, if you don't mind my asking? Not at all. In the nacelle room I had an empathic experience. The Counsellor may have been seeing an event from eight years ago. And I saw you there. Do you have any idea why? I'm afraid I don't. Are you aware that I can sense when someone's telling the truth? I've heard that. Then, if you remember anything relevant to our investigation you'll contact me? Of course. Thank you, Lieutenant. Counsellor. It's strange. I couldn't read him at all. But you implied that... We have played poker many times. I've never known you to bluff. Well, it wouldn't be much of a bluff if you knew, would it? The fact I couldn't read him suggests he must have some telepathic ability. But Pierce is human. That's what I don't understand. Even though I couldn't read his emotions, I felt he was holding something back. I thought so, as well. We should access the Engineering logs from Utopia Planitia. We might find out more about him. There may be something in them about Lt Kwan as well. It's going to take half an hour to complete transmission. Perhaps we should continue this in the morning. It is late. Yes, and you must be tired. A little. So I will say goodnight. Goodnight. We should get an early start tomorrow. I think we should. I'll see you in the morning. Yes. Hello. Breakfast is ready. That sounds nice. But it can wait. Why didn't we do this a long time ago? Crusher to Counsellor Troi. Yes, Doctor? I've synthesised the inhibitor. Come when you're ready. Acknowledged. Crusher to Lt Worf. Worf here. Medical supplies are ready to be taken to cargo bay. I will be there shortly. This should take effect immediately. Will it completely suppress my empathic abilities? It's hard to say. I can increase the dosage if it's not enough. The cargo bay will be off limits to all but Medical personnel. Thanks for your help, sir. You're welcome. Good morning. Counsellor. Data and Geordi are in the nacelle tube. Are you ready? Yes. Excuse me, sir. About the cargo bay quarantine field? We'll need a second field generator. I'm needed here. I'll join you as soon as I can. Alright. Apparently my help was not so good after all! Yes, it was. You were wonderful. I think I know what is wrong... Counsellor. You OK? I'm fine. The inhibitor is working. Have you found anything? No, nothing unusual. I don't remember these from my empathic experience. Have they always been here? No. They were installed two years ago. Geordi. I remember seeing a plasma conduit, right there. The main ODN line runs behind that panel. It lifts out so you can get to it. Kwan was working on that conduit the day before he died. Can you open it? Sure. It'll take just a minute. Data. Lt Nara. May I ask you something? The work Kwan was doing, was it unusual in any way? He was refitting a field coil. It was the first time that panel had been opened since the ship was built. Thank you. No! Counsellor. Are you alright? Something happened when you removed the panel. There's something in there. I'm getting readings indicating organic material in this wall. Organic? You're right. Let me reconfigure the beam. We might be able to see what it is. Here. This dosage should prevent any further empathic flashes. The bone fragments are human. I've sequenced a DNA sample. I'll try to match it to Starfleet records. Accessing personnel records. I'd say these have been in the wall about seven or eight years. You said something happened when the panel was opened. Yes. I wonder if these fragments triggered your experience. I'll run a resonance scan, see if anything turns up. Sir, I think we have a match. The remains are of an Ensign Marla Finn. I'm trying to find a picture. That's her. That's the woman I saw. It says she was reported missing from Utopia Planitia on stardate 40987.2. Eight years ago. But how did her body become embedded in a bulkhead? Maybe there was an accident. Or she was killed and the murderer hid her remains. Something's not right. Pull up Lt Kwan's service record. I thought so. He didn't arrive at the shipyard until six months after Finn's death. I couldn't have seen through his eyes. Then whose? It has to be someone at least partially telepathic. Pierce. But you saw him there. Yes, but not as clearly as everything else. His face looked... ...like that. A reflection. So I was seeing through his eyes. And Finn was trying to get away from him. She was afraid of him. I think it is time we had another conversation with Lt Pierce. Ensign Calloway. Thank you for your help. Deck ten. Worf, can I ask you something? Do you regret what happened last night? No, of course not. I don't want to jeopardise our friendship. Deanna, I do not regret being with you. What is wrong? I'm not feeling myself. Maybe it's the inhibitor. I'm so used to sensing what people are feeling, and now I can't. Perhaps I should talk to Lt Pierce alone. That might be a good idea. I will meet you in your quarters later. I'll be waiting for you. Deck eight. Come in. Security to Counsellor Troi's quarters. Acknowledged. I don't understand. Lt Worf said you wanted to talk to me. Where is he? He said he had to go somewhere. Troi to Worf. Computer, where is Lt Worf? Lt Worf is in Ensign Calloway's quarters. Counsellor? Take Lt Pierce to his quarters and hold him there. Security override. Authorisation Troi Delta 29. Stop it! He's dead! You killed him! No! You know what you have to do. I know what I have to do. What are you doing? You're alive! You're alright! I opened the maintenance door at Troi's request. Then saw her standing too near the force field. It seemed so real! I can't believe everything I experienced happened in just those few seconds. Counsellor Troi was correct. Pierce was partly telepathic. His maternal grandmother was born on Betazed. What else have you found out? According to our records, Pierce and the other persons Troi identified were killed in a plasma discharge eight years ago. Their bodies were never found. I don't believe it was an accident. I think Lt Pierce found the other two having an affair. He lost control and killed them both. Later, he probably activated the plasma stream and threw himself in! The discharge would have obliterated any evidence that it was murder. I scanned behind the panel Counsellor Troi asked me to. I didn't find any bone fragments. But I did find some traces of cellular residue showing some kind of psionic signature. Maybe when Lt Pierce was struck by the plasma stream, the subspace energy present imprinted his empathic pattern in the residue. Like a psychic photograph. That's what triggered my hallucination. My mind took elements from my life and created a situation that in many ways mirrored what happened to Pierce. If you hadn't been there, I would have jumped, just like he did. Counsellor. When I pulled you from the plasma stream, you seemed surprised I was alive. Well, actually, in my hallucination, you were killed. May I ask by whom? Well, you know what they say, Mr Worf. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. "
S7E19,"Why were you rolling around in Cyprion cactus? You know Rebecca Smith? The new tactical officer? We took a walk, we sat down, we got comfortable, things got romantic and then I rolled over. Blurred vision, dizziness. Palpitations. A stinging sensation in the lower spine. It's Terellian Death Syndrome, isn't it? We agreed you'd come to me before checking the medical database. Well, this time I'm glad I did. Maybe we can stop the cellular decay before it's too late. Reg, you don't have Terellian Death Syndrome. You're sure? I'm sure. Then maybe it is Symbalene Blood Burn. No. I don't see anything wrong at all. Wait a minute. There is a slight imbalance in your K-3 cell count. My K-3s? No! Barclay, I'm sure it's nothing. I'll run a microcellular scan. We'll see. This'll take a couple of minutes. How's my smallest patient doing? She is doing well. Her appetite has increased by seven percent. She's engaging in prenatal behaviour. She is getting close. You'll have a fresh litter of kittens this week. Let me run an amniotic scan to make sure everything's fine. Doctor... My capillaries are shrinking. Excuse me. Alyssa, take care of Spot. Start a preliminary amniotic scan. Yes, Doctor. My intravascular pressure is going through the roof. It is elevated. You've also got heightened electrophoretic activity. Electrophoretic activity? Is it serious? Well, based on this, I'd say you've got 70, maybe 80 years. 80 years? Yes, Reg. What you've got is a mild case of Urodelean flu. It's nothing serious. Most humans have an immunity to it. But the T-cell in your DNA that would normally fight it is dormant. So, I have bad genes? You have one dormant gene out of 100,000. I can activate that gene with a synthetic T-cell to let the body fight the infection naturally. You should feel better in a few days. Thank you. I feel much better. Good. Now, stay away from the medical database. And you stay out of the arboretum. Everything looks fine. Do you want to know the sex of the kittens? Many humans prefer not to know in order to experience the surprise during birth. I believe I will preserve the mystery. I know what you mean. I don't want to know either. Alyssa? Spot's not the only one who's going to be a mother. Alyssa, that's wonderful. How did Andrew take the news? He was a little shocked. But he's getting over it. I have spent nine weeks an expectant parent. I could share my insights with your husband. If my experience is any indication, he will need all the help he can get. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 47653.2. We're performing tests of our new tactical systems and weapon upgrades. Mr Worf is supervising the exercises. The next test will involve the photon torpedoes. The explosive yield has been increased by 11 percent. I have enhanced the targeting system for increased accuracy. Sounds fascinating. Please proceed. Setting targeting coordinates. 005, mark 317. Spread pattern Delta 94. Torpedoes armed and loaded, sir. Fire when ready. Worf? One of the torpedoes has veered off course. It is a malfunction in the guidance system. Abort and destroy. The torpedo is not responding. Subspace detonator will not engage. Lock on phasers. The torpedo is out of range. Even for your improved phasers? Maintain a sensor lock. We'll have to go after it. That would be inadvisable. The asteroid field is unusually dense. The Enterprise is too large to navigate through it. I'll take a shuttlecraft. Mr Data, you're with me. Captain, the shuttle pilot on duty is Lt Hayes. I happen to be a reasonably qualified pilot. Besides, these tests hardly require the Captain's personal attention. Understood. Enjoy yourself. Mr Worf. I think that you should consider analysing your new guidance system. Captain, I will need to attend to a personal matter. Me? It may take several days for us to complete our mission. I would prefer a human to supervise the birthing process. Well, I'd be honoured. You are the only other member of the crew who Spot seems to like. Really? That's hard to believe. You're such a sweet little kitty. She is to you. However, there have been several injuries to other members of the crew who have attempted to care for Spot. So, has she picked a place? A place? Cats usually like to pick a specific location to give birth. It's usually dark and secluded. And I believe that this is it. I'm curious, sir. Who's the father? I am not certain. Spot has escaped on several occasions, and there are 12 male felines on board. I intend to run a full DNA analysis on the kittens... Picard to Data. Report to shuttlebay two. On my way, sir. Goodbye, Spot. I believe you are in good hands. You have nothing to worry about, sir. Problem? I have performed 13 diagnostics on the weapons array. I can find nothing wrong. I'll have Geordi run a diagnostic on the torpedo bay. Must you stand so close to me? Lieutenant, are you alright? Yes, I'm fine. You're not. You've been working for six hours. Take a break. But... That's an order. Thanks for waiting. Do not approach me unannounced when I'm eating. We were meant to be having lunch together. I was hungry. I'm hungry, too. Excuse me. Could I have an order of Ongilin caviar? Make that a double order. Certainly. Caviar? For lunch? I'm in the mood for something salty. Besides, it's no stranger than what you're eating. Have you noticed how dry the air is on the ship? Are the environmental controls set properly? You're excused. Here you go. Is something wrong? It has been a difficult day. The torpedo guidance system failed. It was my fault. You always say that. It was my fault! I designed that guidance system! Worf, calm down. I think you're under more stress than you admit. Maybe you should get some rest. Perhaps you are right. If you will excuse me... I didn't mean right now. We removed the guidance module. There's a fluctuation in the forward sensor cluster. We think it may be a radial imbalance. We want to run a diagnostic but we have to shut down power. Wait a minute. Slow down. Which sensor cluster? The forward. A power fluctuation in the converter nodes. It's a minor adjustment. It's all here on this diagram, Commander. I'll look this over later. Run your diagnostic. I'll inform the other departments about the power systems. I'll check that. He's full of energy today. He won't slow down. He's been like that since last night. Looks like a plasma conduit cut out in junction 17. I'll go look at it. I'll go with you. Keep you posted. Computer, increase ambient temperature by two degrees. Increase relative humidity by ten percent. Computer, reset environmental controls to standard. Worf, it's freezing in here. You have raised the temperature three times. It is too hot. Live with it. Computer, execute my original command. I need a bath. You have the bridge. Here we are. Looks like a ruptured conduit. No problem. I'll just bypass it. Reg, wait a second. Take a look at these corroded edges. It looks like something has eaten right through the conduit. There are high levels of cholic acid here. Enzymatic agents. You know, I wouldn't be surprised if that solvent was organic. Maybe we should run a biospectral analysis on the solvent. That's a very good idea, but first we should take a break. You go ahead. I'll take care of it. Commander, we received a communication from Starfleet. They want your performance analysis of the new weapons systems. The weapons systems? Yes, sir. The ones we've been testing for the past few days. That's right. What should I tell them, sir? Tell them... Tell them we haven't finished yet. What are you doing? I had to be near you. Computer, increase temperature by five degrees. Get out of that water! Leave me alone! Could I have a glass of water? It's so cold in here. Your temperature has dropped eight degrees. I want to run a hypothalamic series right away. Three other crew members have complained about the temperature. Some feel like they have fevers. Others are freezing. Call Dr Selar and Dr Hacopian. Looks like a viral infection. I want to check on Lt Worf. Worf, have you had any unusual symptoms lately? Headaches, nausea, dizziness? Do you hear me? I'm gonna run a bioscan. Lie down. OK. We can do this sitting up. What is this? Worf, how long have you had this on your neck? Looks like it's full of a bioacidic compound, almost like a venom sac. Open your mouth. Get a hypospray. I got her into stasis before the venom paralysed her. She will need reconstructive surgery, but I think she'll be alright. Sir, we've analysed the venom. Compared to the acidic compound found at junction 17, they all have the same enzymatic composition. Worf is spraying this... Venom. ...this venom all over the ship? I'd say so. 60 crewmen are exhibiting strange behavioural changes. Memory loss, fatigue, headaches. One thing is clear. There's a disease aboard the Enterprise and it's spreading. I'm having trouble concentrating myself. It's like my mind keeps wandering. I can't... Commander, I've got seven teams hunting Worf. For some reason, the sensors can't lock onto him. I've called a level-two security alert. Should we go to level one? What do you think? I think we should. OK, sounds good. Then you'll take care of that security thing? Yes, sir, I will. I'll notify Starfleet. I'll tell them what's happening. You have your orders. Dismissed. Computer, send a subspace message. Starfleet Command. Security-channel authorisation. Alpha-47 authorisation required to activate security channel. Computer. Awaiting authorisation. Captain's log, supplemental. Cmdr Data and I have recovered the torpedo after three days. We are en route back. Captain, the ship is not at the prearranged coordinates. Have they been delayed? I do not know. I am unable to raise them on any channel. Scan the vicinity. See if you can find them. I found it, sir. Two light years away. Set a course. The Enterprise appears to be adrift. I read power fluctuations on all decks. Life signs? There are life signs. However, sensor readings are distorted. I am unable to identify specific life forms. Adjust the axial stabilisers to match attitude and rotation, then dock the shuttle manually. Main power is off line. All systems are in standby or emergency mode. There is no response from any manned station. Any sign of the crew? I cannot access sensors here. Sounds like animals. Yes, sir. I am able to discern over 300 different vocalisations. Look at this. It is composed of reptilian DNA. I believe it is an epidermal layer cast off during moulting. But it seems to be humanoid. Yes, sir. I cannot explain it. No species aboard the Enterprise shed their skin in this fashion. Sir. These are Counsellor Troi's quarters. Can you tell if she's inside? No, sir. Data. I want to have a look in here. Stand ready. Environmental settings in these quarters have been altered. Data, over here. Deanna. What's happened to her? Her DNA is in a state of ribocyatic flux. Her genetic codes are being resequenced. Her cells are mutating. At a fundamental level, she is no longer human. What is she? Her respiratory tissue can metabolise both water and air. Her eyes have developed nictitating membranes. I believe she is amphibian. She has been injured. Yes, sir. There's Klingon DNA in the wound. It is saliva. She's been bitten? It would appear so. I will need a full biospectral analysis. First we've got to get the ship under control. Let's go to the bridge. His spinal column has been broken in three places. It looks like he was attacked by an animal. Yes, sir. Has his DNA been changed? Yes, sir. However, it was in its initial stages when he died. Captain. I am picking up 1,011 individual life forms within the ship. All exhibit a similar genetic flux to Counsellor Troi's. So the entire ship has been affected. Most life forms are scattered throughout the ship. However, there are concentrations in the arboretum and the aquatic lab. I've regained attitude control but main power is still off line. It looks as if the power-transfer grid has been destroyed. Will? Captain. His cranial plates have thickened by 20 percent. His brain is much smaller. He cannot comprehend our language. Perhaps we can communicate. Will, can you understand what it is... He looks almost proto-human. Yes, sir. His DNA would seem to confirm that observation. Captain, I believe the crew is de-evolving. This tranquilliser should keep him unconscious for seven hours. What have you found out? I have analysed Cmdr Riker's DNA structure. A synthetic T-cell has invaded his genetic codes. This T-cell has begun to activate his latent introns. Introns? They are genetic codes which are normally dormant. They are evolutionary holdovers, sequences of DNA which provided key behavioural and physical characteristics millions of years ago but are no longer necessary. For instance, Counsellor Troi's gills and amphibious characteristics were derived from introns which still contain amphibious codes. So these introns are causing her DNA to recombine in an earlier configuration? That is correct. In her case, the DNA has created an amphibious life form which became extinct over 50 million years ago. Cmdr Riker's introns are changing him into an early hominid. Yes, sir. I would say australopithecine. Each stage is another link in the evolutionary chain which stretches back to the origins of all life forms on Earth. Because introns can include genetic material from many different species over millions of years, it is possible that a wide variety of transformations is occurring. What about crew members not from Earth? All humanoid life has a similar genetic pattern. The virus should work on non-human crew members in the same way. They're each de-evolving into earlier forms of life on their worlds. I feel I must inform you, sir, you have also been infected by the intron virus. How long before I begin to change? According to my calculations, within the next 12 hours, you will exhibit the first signs of your eventual transformation. And what will that be? I believe you will also de-evolve into an earlier form of primate, possibly similar to a lemur or a pygmy marmoset. Well, before I begin swinging through the ship looking for breakfast, we'd better find some answers. How do we reverse the process? I am uncertain. We will need to run microcellular scans. But the ship's main computer has been damaged. Captain. The computer in my quarters has an independent memory-storage unit. It should not have been affected. I suggest we start there. Agreed. It would appear that Spot has had her kittens. They sound hungry. Yes. I am curious as to why Spot is not caring for them. It would seem that the virus is not limited to humanoid life forms. No, sir. What is it? These kittens were born less than 24 hours ago. Spot's transformation took place at approximately the same time. So, Spot was giving birth to the kittens at the same time that she was changing into a reptilian life form. I believe so. For some reason, the intron virus was not passed on to the kittens. I do not know why. If I remember my biology, several immune systems come into play in the mother's womb to protect the foetus from viral infections. True. Placental barriers, maternal antibodies and amniotic fluids all serve as a filtration system. Maybe we could have inhibited the virus by using the natural antibodies in Spot's amniotic fluid. It would take further research. But to be effective on humanoid crew, humanoid antibodies would be necessary. We should locate a pregnant humanoid. Nurse Ogawa has recently become pregnant. Where is she? I have traced her signal to deck 17, section 21 Alpha. The arboretum. One of the warp plasma vents has failed. Main Engineering has been abandoned. There is no one there to fix it. I can repair the damaged plasma vent from here. I'm going to check the status of the warp core. Data! What was that? I believe it was Lt Barclay. He was partially transformed into an arachnid. A spider? Yes, sir. Are you alright, Captain? I have these intense feelings of fear... ...and panic. I feel as if I were being watched. I can't explain it. You may be experiencing the initial stages of transformation. Early primates were often prey to carnivores. As a result, their instincts included a heightened sense of awareness. In that case, my instincts tell me that we'd better hurry. Captain, I have analysed Nurse Ogawa's embryo. It is unaffected by the virus. I believe I can use her amniotic fluid as a retrovirus. It would neutralise the synthetic T-cell and re-establish the genetic patterns. How soon? It will not take long to isolate the material. I will need the sickbay computer. What was that? It is large. Approximately 200 kilograms. It is heavily armoured with an exoskeleton. Life signs appear to be Klingon. Worf. Set your phaser on heavy stun. We cannot be certain a stun setting will work. A higher setting might kill him. Listen to that. He sounds very angry, really aggressive. What do you think he wants? Do you think he's responding to some predatory instinct? Do you think he sees us as prey? There are crew members in the corridors and other sectors. It would be easier to consume one of them than to break through a door. Then what does he want? Predators use vocalisations to frighten other predators, and to mark territory, and to commence mating process. A mating process. Troi was bitten by a Klingon, but nowhere that was life-threatening. Not near a major artery or organ. Data, look at this. Look at this injury. This wound was never intended to give her serious harm. What are you suggesting? Is it possible that Worf sees Troi as his mate? If that is true, he is trying to reach her now. We can't leave. We have to protect her. We have to work on the retrovirus. If we could distract him or lure him away from her... The mating instinct is quite strong in Klingon biology. I am not certain what would be effective. Klingons have a powerful sense of smell. If we could duplicate Deanna's pheromones and convince him that she was no longer in sickbay... I'm extracting a blood sample from a sebaceous gland where the pheromones are produced. I can activate the pheromones with a bioactivant solution. Can you amplify the pheromones to be more powerful than her scent? I believe this will produce the desired effect. I will use it to draw Worf away. You must go on working on the retrovirus. I'll go. Captain, that is unwise. Worf may be faster... No time to argue. Deck 17. Computer, display progress of genetic resequencing. Genetic resequencing in progress. DNA to 70 percent normal. Computer, increase nucleotide substitution by 32 percent. Data to Capt Picard. Go ahead, Data. The retrovirus is working. I can release it in a gaseous state. However, it will take time to take effect. Acknowledged. Are you alright, sir? Yes, I'm fine, Mr Data. Proceed. Well, Mr Worf. Let's hope that when you wake up, you're a new man. Captain's log, supplemental. Cmdr Data has returned the crew to normal. Dr Crusher has determined that the T-cell she used to clear Mr Barclay's Urodelean flu initiated the intron virus which swept through the ship. So, this is my fault? No. In a way, it's mine. I didn't realise it at the time, but an anomaly in your chemistry caused the T-cell to mutate. Instead of activating one dormant gene, it activated all of them, including your introns. And that's what... That's what caused me to de-evolve? You and every other member of the crew. The T-cell became airborne and spread like a virus. You know, Reg, this is a completely new disease. It's traditional to classify a new disease with the name of the first diagnosed patient. You mean you want to name the disease after me? Right. How about Barclay's Protomorphosis Syndrome? Barclay's Protomorphosis... It has a nice ring to it. Thank you, Doctor. He transformed into a spider. Now he has a disease named after him. I think I'd better clear my calendar for a few weeks. "
S7E20,"Captain's log, stardate 47751.2. The Enterprise is at Starbase 310 to meet Fleet Admiral Nechayev. This visit gives us the opportunity to pick up a member of the family. Here you are, your very own quarters. They're far away from mine so you don't have to see me. Mom, that's not why I asked for my own quarters. You don't have to explain. There comes a time when you don't want to stay with your senile mother. I'll visit the old doctors' home every Sunday. Come in. So, is there a runaway cadet in here? If so, we may have to call Security. Welcome back, Wes. How's life at the Academy? It's great. It's great, but it's good to have a break. I was not serious about calling Security. It was a joke. I got it, Data. Are you going to lounge around? I'm sure I can help you. Wes, enjoy your vacation. You've earned it. Thanks. We'd better let you settle in. Yeah. Good idea. Don't sleep your whole vacation away. Goodbye, Wes. It's good to have you home, son. Thanks, Mom. Really. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Admiral Nechayev has beamed aboard. Good. Earl Grey tea. Watercress sandwiches. And Bularian canapés. Are you up for promotion? I am establishing a new relationship with the Admiral. There has been some tension between us in the past. Tension is hardly the word. I will get things off on a better note. I want her to feel at ease and welcome on board the Enterprise. Is there any reason she shouldn't feel welcome here? We don't have to like her but we have orders. Maintaining this atmosphere of confrontation serves no purpose. Admiral Nechayev, welcome to the Enterprise. Thank you. You may leave, Cmdr Riker. Thank you, Admiral. Captain. May I offer you...? I'll come right to the point. There's a situation that's developed on the Cardassian border... Are those Bularian canapés? As a matter of fact, they are. I spoke with your aide, Cmdr Wrightwell. He said that you were fond of them. That was very thoughtful. Thank you. Please. You were saying about the Cardassians...? Yes. The Federation has completed a drawn-out series of negotiations regarding the final status of our border with the Cardassians. These will be the official boundaries. I see. You'll notice a demilitarised zone along the border. Neither side will be permitted to place military outposts, conduct fleet exercises, or station warships in the demilitarised area. This border places several Federation colonies in Cardassian territory, and some Cardassian colonies in ours. This agreement is far from perfect. Neither side got all they wanted. But every side got something. As someone once said, diplomacy is the art of the possible. Those colonies on the wrong side of the border will be moved. The colonists won't be happy about that. Some have been there for decades. It won't be easy. But it's a reasonable price for peace. Your mission will be to evacuate Dorvan V. Dorvan V? Isn't that where the group of North American Indians settled? Yes. They've been there for about 20 years. They've established a village on the southern continent. Is something wrong? Admiral. Centuries ago, these North American Indians were forcibly displaced from their ancestral lands. These settlers originally left Earth more than 200 years ago to preserve their cultural identity. I am aware of that. There are some disturbing historical parallels here. Once more, they are being asked to leave their homes because of a political decision taken by a distant government. An Indian representative was included in the Federation Council. His objections were noted, discussed, but ultimately rejected. Captain. The Indians on Dorvan are a nomadic group that settled there only 20 years ago. At that time, they were warned that the planet was disputed by the Cardassians. They never should have gone there. Granted, but to go to them now after 20 years, and ask them to leave what is now their home... I made that argument with the Federation Council. It took three years to negotiate this treaty. Some concessions had to be made. This was one. What if these Indians refuse? Then your orders are to remove them by whatever means necessary. I understand your moral objections, Captain. If you wish, I can find someone else to command this mission. That will not be necessary, Admiral. I don't envy you this task, but it is for the greater good. I understand. And, Captain. Thank you for making me feel welcome. You will always be welcome aboard this ship. Thanks, Ensign. Wes. There you are. Come here. I've got something to show you. Come on. You gotta take a look at this. Remember how we wanted to improve quantum efficiency with a plasma-dyne new relay? Well, take a look at this. You've only got one microfusion inter-relay? Your converter interface will never hold up. I ran these diagnostics myself. This baby will withstand over 500 Cochranes of warp-field stress. I don't think so. Put a second phase inverter in there. Your subprocessor matrix needs an overhaul. That may be your opinion, Cadet, but I stand by my work. Read the latest paper from Dr Vassbinder. He has brilliant new theories on warp-propulsion inter-relays. He'd say this is obsolete. I don't know what's gotten into you. Do you want my help or not? With this attitude, absolutely not. You're dismissed. Captain's log, supplemental. The Enterprise is at Dorvan V. I have spoken to the leader of their council. He will meet us this afternoon to discuss the situation. Anthwara, there is very little I can do. The decision was made at the highest level of Starfleet. Do you know how long we have searched for a home? Almost 200 years. Then we found this world. Can you blame us for not wanting to give it up? I understand, and I respect your long journey, but I believe that I can find you a new home. Three other planets in this sector have environmental conditions similar to Dorvan V. They're all uninhabited and could be colonised immediately. If none meet with your approval, then we'll find other choices. You do not understand, Captain. The choice of this planet was not only for environmental conditions. There were other more intangible concerns as well. When I came here 20 years ago... ...I was welcomed by the mountains, the rivers, the sky. Anthwara, he is laughing at you. He thinks you're talking about superstition and nonsense. This is not true. I have deep respect for your beliefs and the meaning they hold. Then you can respect the fact that this planet holds a deep spiritual significance for us. It has taken us two centuries to find this place. We do not want to spend another 200 years searching for what we already have. Captain, I suggest we adjourn to allow us all time to think about what's been said. Agreed. We will reconvene tomorrow. I invite you all to join us this evening on the Enterprise. Thank you. We look forward to it. Ever since you've come on board, you've been moody, sullen and rude. What's going on? Nothing. I just want to be left alone. That incident in Engineering was inexcusable. That is my business. Don't tell me how to behave. I shouldn't have to. You should have a certain level of maturity. Maybe I am sick of rules and regulations, maybe I'm sick of living up to everyone else's expectations. Did you ever think of that? I have been fascinated, Iooking into the history and traditions of your people. I was very interested to learn that your grandfather, Katowa, was the man who first led the group of Indians from Earth 200 years ago. There was a great deal of opposition. Even my own father was against it. But when Katowa made his decision, it was final. Father never said another word. It's never easy to leave one's home, the safe and the familiar. But there are times when the greater good demands that certain sacrifices are made. I'm sure that was something your grandfather understood. So does his grandson. There are also times when a people sacrificed too much. When a people must hold on to what we have, even against overwhelming opposition. What do you know about your family, Captain? Well, a great deal, actually. My father was a believer in passing on traditions and history. I would like to know more about your family. We have strong ties to our ancestors. We believe their actions guide us even now. Knowing more about your family might help me to understand you. Besides, it is always good to understand one's adversary in any negotiation. I hope that by the end of this, you will no longer look on me as an adversary. My family. Our roots in Europe go back to the time of Charlemagne. I'm sorry I'm late. We'll talk about it later. Wesley Crusher? Yes? I am Lakanta. It's nice to meet you. Can I get you a drink? I have known that you were coming to us for the past two years. Two years ago... ...I went into the Habak and began a vision quest. While I was there, I saw many things, talked to many animals, many spirits. And I saw you. I don't think I understand. I know why you came to us. To find the answers that you seek. I don't know what to do. It's as if somebody took my son and left a stranger in his place. In a sense, that's what happened. When Wesley left three years ago, he was a boy. Now he has returned a young man. That can't be easy for a mother or a son. It's gone beyond the two of us. The incident with Geordi. Have you heard about the Academy? I called Admiral Brand today. She said his grades are dropping, he's remote and defensive. If he's not careful, he'll wash out. Maybe you should talk to him, Jean-Luc. Maybe it's a thing a man needs to discuss with another man. I don't think he wants to talk right now. But he needs our help. He has to want help. If he doesn't, then our efforts will only push him further away. He's got to work this out for himself. How long have you been watching me? Since you beamed down. I'm here. What should I do? I don't know. You said you would help me find answers. Answers to your questions. Tell me about this Habak. You said you had a vision there? The Habak is holy to us. We hold our rituals and our ceremonies there. It's sacred to us. What's sacred to you, Wesley? I don't know. I think things are important. I have respect for things. But I don't really consider anything sacred. Look around us. What do you think is sacred to us here? Maybe the necklace you're wearing? The designs on the walls? Everything is sacred to us. The buildings, the food, the sky, the dirt beneath your feet. And you. Whether you believe in your spirit or not, we believe in it. You are a sacred person here, Wesley. That's the first time anyone's used that word to describe me. So, if you are sacred, then you must treat yourself with respect. To do otherwise is to desecrate something that is holy. Is that what you think I've been doing? Only you can decide that. I guess I haven't had a lot of respect for myself lately. Then perhaps it's time for your own vision quest to begin. Anthwara, I regret that we have not reached an agreement. But, and I must be blunt, I cannot take no for an answer. This planet will be handed over to the Cardassian government in accordance with the terms of the border agreement. I'm very sorry, but you will have to leave. And if we do not? Then I will be forced to remove you by whatever means are necessary. We know you will not take us from this land. I may regret it, but I am not able... When you first came to us, we did not know why you were sent by the Federation, but we knew there must be a good reason. To us, nothing that happens is truly random. So, we searched for the true reason you were sent but did not find it until last night. Are you familiar with the Pueblo Revolt of 1680? I am. Several Indian tribes rose up to overthrow their Spanish overlords and drove them out of New Mexico. Ten years later, the Spanish returned to reconquer the area. They were brutal. I would use the word ""savage."" They killed hundreds of our people. Thousands more were maimed. The name of one of the soldiers... ...was Javier Maribona-Picard. Your ancestor. I'm not aware of this incident or of the man you named. This happened more than 700 years ago. I do not see what bearing... That is why you have come to us, to erase a stain of blood... ...worn by your family for 23 generations. Mr Worf. What is going on? We have unwelcome visitors, sir. I am Capt Picard of the Enterprise. I am Gul Evek. What are all these people still doing here? The evacuation should be under way. May I have a word with you? Alone. As you wish. Wait here. There should be no Cardassian presence here for six weeks. Your arrival may have upset some delicate negotiations. Negotiations? This has been settled. What are you negotiating? I will be happy to explain that. For now, I must ask you to leave immediately. We have been sent to perform a preliminary survey of buildings and equipment. I will not leave until our mission is complete. Very well. Complete your mission. But remember, this is Federation territory. Until that changes, these people are under my jurisdiction. I will protect them. Is that a threat? It's a fact. Bear that in mind while you conduct your survey. This is the Habak, the focal point of our lives. Strangers are not welcome. When I asked to come here... You're not a stranger. I told you, I've seen you here before. What are those figures? They are Mansara. Dolls that represent the spirits that come to this place. That one looks like a Klingon. Yes. Our culture is rooted in the past, but it's not limited to the past. The spirits of the Klingon, the Vulcan, the Ferengi come to us just as the bear and the coyote, the parrot. There's no difference. What should I do? Start the fire. Sit and wait. What am I waiting for? This is your journey, Wesley. I can open the door, but only you can go through it. Admiral, the Indian Council is adamant. They refuse to leave. Is there any indication the Council will change their position? No, sir. Then I see no choice. Admiral, they will resist any attempt to remove them. I strongly request an emergency session of the Federation Council. The issue of Dorvan V must be reopened. I made that request two days ago. The answer was no. I'm sorry, but you have your orders. Starfleet out. So much for your reprieve. Anthwara believes that I am responsible for the crimes of one of my ancestors against his people. Do you believe that? No, of course not. I respect his belief. But I do not see how it can have bearing on this mission. But even so, I can't help wondering... ...if a dark chapter in my family's history is about to be repeated. If those people take up arms against us, then I cannot foresee the consequences. Mr Worf, come in here. Aye, sir. Mr Worf, will you begin preparations to remove the inhabitants? Aye, sir. Wesley. Dad? You've reached the end. The end of what? This journey. One you started a long time ago. When I left you and your mother. You mean, when you died. You set out on a journey that wasn't your own. Now it's time to find a path that is truly yours. Don't follow me any further. I don't understand. Yes, you do. It's just hard for you to accept. Goodbye, Wesley, and good luck. Dad, wait. Mr Crusher. Are you alright? Yeah, I'm fine. Lay a confinement beam to the southeast. Be discreet. We do not wish to alarm these people. Worf. What are you doing? We are laying out transporter coordinates for a security perimeter. It may be necessary to remove these people by force. Worf. We can't do this. These people deserve better than to be removed from their homes. I understand, but... Do you know what they're doing? Preparing to beam you to their ship. You're not gonna let them do that? No, we won't. Leave now. Inexcusable. You defied the orders of the ranking officer. You put the lives of the away team in jeopardy. You made an already tense situation worse. Your actions reflect very badly on this ship and on that uniform. I want an explanation, Mr Crusher, and I want it now. What you're doing down there is wrong. These people are not some random group. They are a unique culture that predates the Federation. But my orders... I know that Admiral Nechayev gave you an order. She was given an order from the Federation. It's still wrong. That decision is not yours to make, Cadet. I don't know what has got into you lately. Frankly, I don't care. I will tell you this, while you wear that uniform, you will obey every order. You will conform to Starfleet regulations. Is that clear? Yes, sir, it is. But I won't be wearing this uniform any longer. I'm resigning from the Academy. Riker to Captain. Go ahead. Gul Evek wants to discuss the situation on the surface. Let him come aboard. I'll see him in here. Aye, sir. Why are you doing this? I told you. Starfleet isn't for me. Look, I can't stop you from throwing away your life, but you are going to explain it to me first. You owe me that much. I saw Dad today. He told me not to follow him. You what? I was participating in an Indian ritual. I had a vision. Dad came to me and told me not to follow him. He said I had to find my own path. Is that what this is all about? A vision told you to leave the Academy, And now you're packing your bags? No. No, it's more than that. I've known I needed to do this for a long time. I haven't been able to admit it. You said being at the Academy was the best thing that happened to you. I know. For while, it was. But as time went on, and graduation got closer, I started feeling really depressed. I thought it was the workload or the stress of being away from home, but it didn't go away, it just got worse. Why didn't you ever say anything? I didn't want to disappoint you or Capt Picard or my friends. You guys were so proud of me. I'd be proud of you no matter what you were doing. I love you. I know, Mom. I guess the truth is that I was afraid of disappointing myself. I never questioned being in Starfleet. But when Dad said not to follow him, it just made so much sense. Everything is so clear now. Maybe it is partly my fault. We didn't realise the pressure we put on you to be exactly what we expected you to be. I don't blame you at all. This is my decision. It always has been. You know that alien from Tau Ceti, who controlled warp fields with his mind? The Traveller? He told Capt Picard a long time ago that you were special, like Mozart. And that you were destined for something different from us. Maybe this is the first step. I love you. I love you, too, Mom. You shouldn't be here, Wesley. Why? Get down. Bring them here. Why take these men prisoner? They have no right to be here. The terms of the treaty gives them the right. We don't recognise that treaty. Worf to Picard. An armed group of Indians has taken two Cardassian prisoners. The situation is volatile. Request instructions. Stand by, Mr Worf. Have your ship beam your people out of there. My people? What about these Indians? They've taken hostages. This is our planet. We will not be chased away by an unruly crowd. Gul Evek to the Vetar. This is Glinn Telak. Two of our men have been taken prisoner. Prepare to send an armed squad to occupy the village. Gul Evek. They are Federation citizens. I am sworn to protect them. If you attack that village, my security forces will respond. I hope you realise the consequences of firing on Cardassian troops? Yes, I do. That is why we must stop this now before it's too late. I cannot allow you to hold these men as prisoners. You have no authority here. No! What happened? Did you do this? I didn't do anything. You did. I did? You pulled yourself out of their time. You took the first step. My first step to where? To another plane of existence, another way of thinking. I don't understand. You've found a new beginning. The first step on a journey that few humans will ever take. Who are you? The Traveller. I've waited a long time for this moment, Wesley. So all those things I saw in the Habak... ...my father, and the things he said to me, that was your doing? I merely opened the door for you. What you experienced came from your own mind, your own spirit, if you wish. I hoped that you would open your mind, and you did. You pulled yourself out of time. You've evolved to a new level. You're ready to explore places where thought and energy combine in ways you can't even imagine. And I will be your guide. If you would like. What about them? I can't just leave them like this. They must find their own destinies. It's not our place to interfere. Have faith in their abilities to solve their problems on their own. The Cardassian ship is powering its weapons. Vetar to Gul Evek. Our troops are under attack. What are your orders? Evek, the last war caused massive destruction and cost millions of lives. Don't send our two peoples down that path again. The future lies in your hands right now. Give us one last chance for peace. Gul Evek, what are your orders? Can we open fire? Evek to the Vetar. Lock on our troops on the surface and beam them aboard. But they've been fired upon. Those are my orders. Beam up the away team immediately. I lost two of three sons in the war, Captain. I don't want to lose the last one. Anthwara. I want to be absolutely sure that you understand the implications. By giving up your status as Federation citizens, any future request you or your people make to Starfleet will go unanswered. You will be on your own and under Cardassian jurisdiction. I understand, Captain. We are prepared to take that risk. Will the Cardassian government honour your agreement here? I believe I can convince them that this is an equitable solution. I cannot speak for every Cardassian, but if you leave us alone, I suspect that we will do the same. Will this be acceptable to the Starfleet? It will not be easy, but with Admiral Nechayev's support, I think they will go along with it. Then if there's nothing else, I'll return. I have a lengthy report to write. Captain. Anthwara. I was right, Captain. You did not take us from our land, and you have wiped clean a very old stain of blood. Captain's log, stardate 47755.3. The Enterprise is preparing to leave Dorvan V, but former cadet Wesley Crusher will be staying behind. Where will you go? The Traveller said that my studies would begin with these people. He said that they are aware of many things. I can learn a lot from them. That's just what I need, more studying. Somehow, I think you'll manage. Me, too. Well, good luck, Mr... Good luck, Wesley. Thank you. For a lot of things. You be sure and dress warmly on those other planes of existence. I will. Bye, Mom. Goodbye. Energise. "
S7E21,"As time passes, a boy inevitably becomes a man. But what is not inevitable is that a man becomes a warrior. A warrior must be forged, like a sword, tempered by... ...by... ...tempered by experience. The path of a warrior begins with... Alexander. No, wait! Sorry. I didn't mean to hit you. What is the meaning of this? I'm sorry. We made fullerenes at chemistry class and filled them with water. I asked you to meet me here. I have been waiting. I forgot. You forgot because you allowed yourself to be distracted. I'm sorry. There is something very important I want to discuss. It concerns your future. Sit. As time passes, a boy inevitably becomes a man, but what is not inevitable is that a man becomes a sword. What? I meant, warrior. The path of a warrior begins with the First Rite of Ascension. When they hit you with painstiks? No, that is the Second Rite. You are approaching the Age of Ascension. It is time for you to prepare. What do I have to do? Your fighting skills will be tested and your knowledge of the teachings of Kahless. It will be challenging, but I will help you prepare. These are the kor'tova candles. They represent the fire within the heart of a warrior. When you light yours, you declare your intention to become a warrior. Go ahead. What if I don't want to? If you do not participate in the rite before 13 years, you will never become a true Klingon warrior. I don't care. You may not now, but you might. Mother said I didn't have to do this Klingon stuff if I didn't want to. It is your decision... OK, then. I'm not going to do it. Alexander. You said it was up to me. I don't want to be a warrior. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. We can't rendezvous with the Kearsarge for four days. Will we hold position here? Yes. And as we're in for a relatively quiet time, I shall visit the Hatarian system. There are some ancient ruins being excavated. The delay allows Stellar Dynamics to complete their study of the Vodrey Nebula. They can use the lateral-sensor grid. We could use this time to recalibrate the weapons-targeting system. Mr Worf? Yes. I will begin the procedure immediately. Very good. Dismissed. Lieutenant, could I have a word with you for a moment? I noticed during the briefing that you appeared to be a bit distracted. I apologise. My personal affairs should not interfere with my duties. Is everything alright? I'm having problems with Alexander. He does not wish to participate in the First Rite of Ascension. I see. I try to tell him that it is important in a young Klingon's life, but he does not understand. He's had so little opportunity to spend time with Klingons. You know, the Festival of Kot'baval is tomorrow. If he could take part in that, he would more fully appreciate his rich cultural heritage. There is the Klingon outpost on Maranga IV. They'll be celebrating the festival. Yes. But the outpost is on the other side of the Vodrey Nebula. It would take three days by shuttle. The Enterprise could be there in a fraction of the time. I could not ask you... Stellar Dynamics would like a trip around the nebula. Thank you, sir. Who's that? It is the tyrant Molor. He was so strong, no one could stand against him. What's he saying? He is asking if anyone else will stand up to Molor. What is this? You wounded me. You fought well. What happens now? Only one man can stand against Molor. It's Kahless. Kahless would rather die than live under Molor's tyranny. Kahless! Father. Where have you been? We watched the fire dancers. We? K'Nor and Bar'el. They live here. I need some money. What for? The man there says he has Molor's head in a box. The real Molor. That is impossible. The real Molor died centuries ago. I know. It's mummified. He'll show us for 50 darseks. He is trying to take your money. Please. He's waiting. No. It is too late. We should go. But... Alexander. That is enough. Come. It is time to go. I have to say goodbye to my friends. See your friends tomorrow. We're coming back? If you want to. Run! You are too much for them. I have seen you before. Who are you? A friend. You are K'mtar. Your brother sent me here to protect you. He is gin'tak to the House of Mogh. Gin'tak? An adviser so trusted, he is part of the family. Do you know who was behind the attack? It is a Klingon matter. It is not your concern. One of my officers was almost killed. That makes it my concern. Recently, rumours began to circulate on the Homeworld that an assassination attempt would be made on the family of Mogh. Kurn sent me here to make sure nothing happened to Worf. Why didn't you warn him before the attack? I tried to contact him over subspace. I was told he was not aboard. I decided to beam directly to the surface. Why didn't you let us know? Forgive me for being blunt, but when it comes to protecting the house to which I have pledged my life... ...I trust no one. I have full confidence in the officers with whom I serve. One of the attackers dropped this dagger. The design represents the House of Duras. We have other evidence that indicates the Duras sisters, Lursa and B'Etor, were behind it. What were they after? Kurn's seat on the Council, of course. We cannot allow their attack to go unanswered. First, we must find them. At one point, they were on Deep Space Nine, trying to sell explosives. That was months ago. No one knows where they went from there. Maybe we can find them. We've arranged for quarters if you'd like to stay. I would. Worf and I have much to discuss. I will send Kurn a message telling him what happened. But he will not receive it for days. He's gone... Why did you treat Cmdr Riker disrespectfully? You were rude. I may have been rude by human standards. I meant no disrespect. What is the matter, Worf? Have you been living so long among humans that you have forgotten how Klingons behave? I have not forgotten. Their ways are different than ours. I trust your son is aware of that fact. Yes, of course. Good. Because Alexander may be called upon to lead the House of Mogh. Kurn has no male heir. He wants to make sure that Alexander is preparing himself. Does my brother doubt my ability to raise my son as a Klingon? No. But you are alone among humans. It cannot be easy to keep our ways. Well, it has not been easy. How are his fighting skills? Can he handle a bat'leth? He is learning. He could be better. He must. He is nearing the Age of Ascension. Actually, Alexander has not committed himself to the rite. What? I have tried to explain how important it is, but he will not listen to me. Perhaps together, you and I, we can find a way to spark the boy's interest in his heritage. I would be grateful for any help. Tomorrow, then. Tomorrow. May I say goodnight to the boy? Yes. Of course. Is this your mother? Yeah. She died when I was little. You miss her a great deal, don't you? It must be hard, being the only Klingon your age on this ship. Sometimes. Have you been to the Homeworld? No. I think you would like it. At your uncle's house, there is a lake you can swim in that is so clear you can see all the way to the bottom. Really? You have cousins there. They want to meet you. I don't know... I understand. You're afraid. You don't know whether the Homeworld is safe. Yeah. What happened today on the planet is frightening. You're troubled. I thought they would kill my father. You must have wanted to help us fight them off. I didn't know what to do. Someday, if you work hard, you will become a warrior, a Klingon warrior, and you will always feel safe because you will know how to defend yourself. I'll tell you something else. If anyone ever tries to hurt your father again, you will be able to fight at his side and make sure nothing happens to him. What do you think of that? Goodnight, Alexander. Dream well. Goodnight, K'mtar. Any luck? Starfleet records contain no mention of the sisters after their departure from Deep Space Nine. Did I not tell you as much? Have you contacted Deep Space Nine? I am being patched through now. On screen. Quark. I see you remember me. How could I forget the only man ever to win dabo at my table? How could I forget that you didn't have the latinum for my winnings? I thought I explained. My brother misplaced the key to the safe. Those vouchers are every bit as good as latinum. You can spend latinum anywhere. Those vouchers are only good at your bar. Is that what this is about? You're on your way and calling to reserve a holosuite? I hoped you could help with something. What would that be? I'm looking for some friends. The Duras sisters, Lursa and B'Etor. Yes. Lursa and B'Etor. Big talk, small tips. Where can I find them? Well, I did hear a rumour, actually. What kind of rumour? I don't know. I'm sure it was told in confidence. And how much would your confidence cost? How many vouchers do you have again? I have enough for 12 bars of latinum. I'd be glad to return them. I believe the rumour was that the sisters were trying to buy mining equipment. What for? They learned of a magnesite deposit on the Kalla system. It belongs to the Pakleds. Those fools don't know it's there. Your friends tried to get at it. Alright. I'll send those vouchers to you. Don't bother. I voided them while we've been talking. So long, Quark. How long to get to the Kalla system? Approximately 16 hours, sir. Was he lying? Why would he? I'd just be knocking on his door again, and I wouldn't be in a good mood. Congratulations, Commander. I did not think it would be possible to find the sisters. Take us out of orbit. Aye, sir. I created a holodeck program. What kind? I'll show you. Computer, run program K'mtar Alpha One. Program initiated. Enter when ready. Why did you want to recreate this? You said you wished you had helped your father fight, but you did not know how. You have probably fought that battle over and over in your mind. Yes. Let's see what happens now. Computer, give me two Klingon warriors. How can I fight someone that big? Size is not the most important thing. Skill, cunning, powers of observation are the most important weapons. Freeze program. Look what this ko'tal is doing. You see his leg? That will give you a clue as to his next move. His weight is on his right foot. He has to shift it to regain his balance. Stand ready. Computer, resume program. Finish him. Freeze program. You should have killed him. Why did you not? I don't know. Look at him! He did not care that you showed him mercy. He was going to kill you! K'mtar, that is enough. If this was real, he'd be dead by now. Alexander. We are approaching Kalla III. Standard orbit. Any evidence of a mining expedition? A shaft has been cut through the crust. There is evidence of machinery but it is not in use. Life signs? Difficult to say. The magnesite is interfering with bioreadings. Assemble an away team. Who are you? Gorta. I am Gorta. Why are you on this planet? I crashed here. Then you are denying involvement in illegal mining? Mining? So that's what all this equipment is for. We are looking for two Klingon women. Sisters. Lursa? B'Etor? Do you know where they are? We were hoping you did. Maybe I do. Would you share that with us? My personal code of conduct prohibits sharing. But I'd consider a trade. Does your code tell you that when you're stranded, you shouldn't try to cut deals? You have a point. We could certainly provide passage in exchange for information. Could you perhaps fail to tell the Pakleds that we were mining their ore? Don't push your luck. But if you get us to the sisters, I'll see. The Duras sisters. They are magnificent, aren't they? Where are they now? Selling the ore, I imagine. They took everything. The ore, the ship. Where have they gone? We were going to sell the ore to an Yridian trader in the Ufandi system. Gather your belongings. It is time to leave. Like I said, they took everything. Worf. I am sorry about what happened. I should not have gotten so angry. It's just that I am worried about Alexander. As am I. Kurn told me that his mother actively discouraged him exploring his Klingon heritage. When he came to live with me, he knew nothing of our ways. He often reminds me of the things his mother said to him. I try not to disregard her wishes. I want him to honour his mother. Someday, he will appreciate you and be grateful for all that you have done for him. But still, compared to other boys his age, his fighting skills are years behind. Yes, I know. He does not put in the time it takes to learn the skills. I thought that you might send him to the training academy at Ogat. Your brother is an influential man. I'm sure he could get Alexander admitted. Ogat? I am only thinking of what is best for the boy. There, he would learn our ways. He would live like a Klingon. I would like him to learn our ways. No. This is his home. How can you expect him to lead our family when all he knows is life aboard a Federation starship? He is my son. He belongs with me. The boy is more human than Klingon. If he stays here, he will never be a warrior. He will never defend our family Against its enemies. Enough! The decision is mine. Not necessarily. It's within my rights to invoke ya'nora kor. You would question my fitness to raise my son? For the good of our house, yes. I beg of you, please stop thinking of yourself. It is Alexander we should be considering. Look into your heart and do what is best for him. Kahless was determined to teach his brother a lesson because he had told a lie. But Morath refused to fight him and instead ran away. Kahless pursued him across the valleys, over the mountains and down to the edge of the sea. There, at the shore, they fought for... ...12 days, 12 nights. I've heard this story before. Alexander, it is important to tell these stories, even though we already know them. Why was Kahless so mad about the lie? It made him look like a coward. If Kahless had explained, they wouldn't have to fight about it. You miss the point. Was Morath wrong to run away? Maybe he didn't want to have to fight his brother and kill him. He ran because he was a coward. How do you know? No more questions. These are our stories. It is important for a warrior to learn how to interpret them properly. I'm trying to... No. Your head is filled with foolish human notions about how things are. You are Klingon. It is time you began to act like one. I am part human, too. Listen to me, Alexander. When a human looks at you, he does not see himself. He sees a Klingon. It doesn't matter what I look like. It does. You are different than everyone else aboard this ship. That's not true. It is. The only way that you will ever feel as if you truly belong is to leave here and go and live with your own kind. I know a Klingon school. You would be welcome there. They would teach you to be a warrior, prepare you for the Rite of Ascension. I don't know if I want that. After you were there for a while, you would find that you wouldn't want anything else. I don't want to leave the ship. You must. Everything depends upon it. I thought you were different. I thought you understood me. But you don't. You're just like my father. All you care about is me becoming a warrior. Leave me alone. First Officer's log, stardate 47779.4. We've entered the Ufandi system, where we believe the Duras sisters have come to sell the ore they mined on Kalla III. I am detecting a vessel near the third planet. It is a Yridian freighter. On screen. Scan for magnesite in its hold. The resonant signature indicates that there is magnesite ore present. Then we're too late. The sisters have been here. Somehow, I doubt the Yridians will be forthcoming. Sir. Readings indicate that there are 500kg of ore in the Yridian hold. There should be over 10,000kg. That's odd. Hail them. I'm Cmdr William Riker from the Federation Starship Enterprise. I am Yog. Why are we speaking? Our sensors indicate you're carrying magnesite ore. Magnesite, yes. Where did you get it? From a Corvallan. For a good price. Where is this Corvallan now? I'm under orders to acquire some magnesite. He is gone. Where? Who is to know? Would you sell me the ore? No. I have a buyer. You haven't heard my offer. Half a gram of Anjoran biomimetic gel. Done. Once we verify the purity of your ore, we'll beam over the gel. You're up to something. Have the transporter room beam the ore to these coordinates. Sir. That would place the ore off the starboard bow. I know. Transport complete. Lock on the ore and fire. Firing. A Klingon bird-of-prey. Put a tractor beam on it. How did you know? The Yridians only had part of the shipment. We arrived before they completed the transfer. The Klingon ship is hailing us. On screen. Release our vessel at once. I don't think so. We've done nothing wrong. A simple business transaction. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. I want to talk about the assassination attempt on Lt Worf. What assassination attempt? This is the first I've heard of it. Too bad it didn't succeed. We have evidence you're behind it. That is outrageous. What is this evidence? Beam over. We'll show you. We'll be there shortly. This was dropped by one of the assassins. It bears your crest. Someone must have given it to the assassins to implicate us. Why would someone do that? In order to tarnish our good name. You cannot tarnish a rusted blade. Mr Worf! You said there was other evidence that they were involved. Yes. On the Homeworld. We'll set a course. I want this cleared up. I will send a message to Kurn. He may wish to return to the Homeworld as well. Impossible. What is it? These markings represent the members of our house. This symbol represents our father, myself, my sister. This represents her son. I was not aware you had a son. I do not. But I am with child. She found out only a few days ago and told no one but me. How can this marking be here? Where did this come from? I will speak with K'mtar. Father. Stop. I am your son. I am Alexander. What are you saying? I am your son Alexander. I have come to this time from 40 years in the future. K'mtar, tell me the truth, or I will kill you. Look at me. When we first met, you said I looked familiar. Maybe I saw you on the Homeworld. No! Look closely. I am your son. If you are Alexander, you will remember your mother's last words before she died. I was three years old. She was dying when we found her. She barely managed to whisper my name. And then she took my hand and placed it in yours. Then she died. And then you howled in rage and said, ""Look upon her. Look upon death and always remember."" And I always have. How have you done this, come to this time? I met a man in the Cambra system. He gave me a chance to change the past. He had the ability to send me to this time. You came here to end your own life? I was hoping that I would not have to, that I could change things, that I could change myself. But I could not. Now everything is going to turn out like it did before. I cannot let that happen. But why? What will happen that is so terrible? You will be killed because I was too naive, too weak to be able to protect you. I do not believe that. I was there! I saw you murdered. I was to blame. You must not blame yourself. You don't understand. I did not become a warrior. I was a diplomat, a peacemaker. When it came my time to lead our family, I thought that I could single-handedly end the fighting between the great houses. I announced that the House of Mogh would end the feuding, that there would be no more retribution or revenge. You tried to warn me, to tell me I should not show weakness. But I thought you were a foolish old man. I told you that you were a relic from an earlier time and that a new era of peace was at hand. But you were right. My enemies saw my weakness and moved against me. And unless I stop it right now, that boy will see his father killed on the floor of the Great Council Chamber. That is why you wanted to turn him into a warrior. I staged the assassination attempt to try and frighten him, to make him realise that he must follow the ways of the warrior. If I had listened to you, if I become the warrior that you had wanted me to be... ...you would not have died in my arms. No. Who knows the future will be now that you have disrupted time? I may die tomorrow. I may outlive you. But when I die, I would like an honourable death. The only way that is possible is for you to accept yourself as you are and stay true to what you believe. The cause of peace is a just cause. The struggle must continue. It is a futile struggle. I cannot change things. You have already changed things more than you realise. The boy I was has not changed. But I have. You have given me a glimpse into my son's future, and I know now that he has his own destiny. And I believe it will be a great one. I love you, Father. And I, you, Alexander. I've been waiting. Where's K'mtar? He had to leave. He was called away. He never said goodbye. He asked me to say goodbye for him. He wanted me to tell you, no matter what you do with your life, he will always care for you. When will I see him again? It may be a long time. We should start practice. Alexander. There will be plenty of time for training. "
S7E22,"Report. There's an object of some kind closing in on our position. On screen. It appears to be an unmanned probe, about half a metre in diameter. No identifiable armaments. Captain, we are being... You are being hailed, by name. Open a channel. This is Capt Jean-Luc Picard... Captain, I am reading a power surge. Shields up. The beam contains holographic imaging information. It's trying to project something. Isolate the bandwidth. Let the signal through the shields. Bok! I trust you remember me, Picard. Because I haven't forgotten you, or how you murdered my son. For 15 years now, I've thought about how to avenge his death. But nothing I could do to you could equal what you did to me. Until now. You thought you could hide him from me, but I found out about him. Jason Vigo is as good as dead. I'm going to kill your son, Picard. Just like you killed mine. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Mr Worf, put a tractor beam on that probe. Determine if it's safe to beam it on board. I want to know where it came from. Mr Data, see if there is a Jason Vigo in Federation records. You might start with Miranda Vigo. She was born on New Gaul about 50 years ago. Aye, sir. Contact the Ferengi government, find out all you can about Bok. He was in a DaiMon's uniform. If he's regained his rank, I want to know why. Come. The Ferengi government is debating the Rules of Acquisition. It could be a while before we hear from them. Data found out that the woman you mentioned has a son named Jason. This is the most recent picture we could find. How old is the boy now? 23. He and his mother left Earth 12 years ago. They settled on Camor V. That's all we know. The planet's records are virtually non-existent. Picard to bridge. Set a course for the Camor system. Warp five. Aye, sir. Will... I do appreciate your not asking. But I do think that you have a right to know. There is a possibility that the boy is my son. I was involved with his mother for a short time about... ...24 years ago. We met through a friend when I was on shore leave on Earth. It was all very romantic. Very intense. Probably because we both knew that I would be leaving in two weeks. And we kept in touch for a while, but we never managed to get together again. She never told you she was pregnant? No. So either Bok is wrong and I'm not the father, or Miranda decided to raise the child alone. Which, frankly, wouldn't surprise me. She was very independent. Very strong willed. She'd have to be to get by on Camor V. But whether he's my son or not, he is in danger. Bok tried to kill me six years ago. I don't doubt that he will try to make good his threat against the boy. Anything? No Ferengi vessels in range of our scanners. Captain, I can find no information on Jason Vigo's current whereabouts. What about his mother? No, sir. Miranda was trained as a botanist. She used to talk of running a farm. Concentrate on agricultural areas. That would narrow our search. The only cultivated land is on the southern continent. Few people are engaged in agricultural activities. There cannot be many non-Camorites among them. Scan for human life. I'm detecting eight humans. Three are female, but they are too young to be Miranda Vigo. What about males? One is an infant, another is elderly, two are middle-aged. That's seven. You said eight. I am having difficulty getting a reading on the eighth. The individual appears to be two kilometres beneath the planet's surface. Male or female? Male. Between 20 and 30 years old. No sane person would go that far underground alone. Unless forced to. Captain, I'm reading seismic instability. He is in danger. Relay his coordinates to the transporter room. Beam him aboard. Aye sir. What the...? This is a Federation ship. That's right. I'm Capt Picard. Jean-Luc Picard. I realise I wasn't supposed to be spelunking that cave, but don't you have better things to do? We thought you were at risk. Well, I wasn't. So maybe you should just beam me back. Are you Jason Vigo? I know him. Is he in trouble? In a manner of speaking. Someone has made a threat against his life. Jason. I'm an old friend of your mother's I'm here because you're in danger. Why would anybody want to kill me? The person who has made the threat is under the impression that you... ...are my son. Am I? I don't know. My mother never told me who my father was. Just that he was in Starfleet. Maybe we should contact her. She died a few years ago. I'm sorry. Jason, I think it's important that we find out one way or the other. Would you be willing to permit a genetic test? If I'm not your son, is this person still gonna want to kill me? I doubt it. Then you won't mind my saying that I hope you're not my father. What were you doing in the caves, Jason? Are you a seismologist? No. I just enjoy climbing. Without an antigrav harness? No, they get in the way. So, what do you do? I'm between jobs right now. I see. Excuse me, gentlemen, the test results are ready. Your genetic code is a cross between the DNA of your mother, Miranda Vigo, and your father... ...Jean-Luc Picard. What's all this? These are archaeological fragments that I've collected over the years. This is a Silvan glyph stone. And this is... This is a Gorlan prayer stick. It's really quite rare. Is it valuable? Not really. Only to students of archaeology such as myself. Though I did hand over a bottle of very old Saurian brandy for it. I'd say you got taken. Well, perhaps. But it's of value to me, nonetheless. On Camor, something has value if you can eat it or sell it. Everything else is luxury. Would you like some tea? No. Thanks. Something else? No. Tea, Earl Grey, hot. I'm sure this whole thing is as much of a surprise to you as it is to me. I really want to be honest with you, Jason. I only knew your mother for a very short time. I would have liked to have known her better. It just didn't work out that way. You look a lot like her, you know. It's the eyes, I think. I would like to make one thing clear, Jason. Your mother never told me about you. If she had, I would have been part of your life. Maybe that's not what she wanted. I think I'd like to go back to the surface now. It would be better if you stayed on the Enterprise until we resolve this situation with Bok. What is this situation with Bok anyway? Why does he want me dead? Years ago, I was forced to destroy a starship commanded by his son. Bok apparently feels that it would be fitting vengeance to kill my son. Well, I can't hide forever. Of course not. We are trying to locate Bok now. I want to confront him, settle this. How long is this gonna take? There is no one more eager to put this behind us than I am. Where do I stay? We'll get you some quarters. OK, let's go. Jason. Your being here, I hope it will give us the chance to get to know each other. We shut down the probe's power system to beam it aboard. It's not gonna be easy to figure out where it came from. Bok encrypted the probe's navigational systems so we would be unable to decipher its flight path. We ran an analysis of the hull. From the particle deposits we found, it travelled through a dichromic nebula, was exposed to gravometric distortion and passed within a light year of a class-four pulsar. Those phenomena are common. We need to identify at least one to postulate a flight path. Understood. Captain, incoming message from DaiMon Birta. Put it on screen. Thank you for taking the time to talk with us, DaiMon. I understand you have a problem. Yes, it concerns DaiMon Bok. Bok is no DaiMon. He was relieved of command six years ago. He was unstable, dangerous. We had to confine him to Rog Prison. But he's no longer there. He was able to buy himself out about two years ago. I see. Do you know his whereabouts now? I understand he was seen in the Dorias Cluster not too long ago. But that cluster consists of more than 20 star systems. You don't have to thank me, Captain. Believe it or not, that might be the fix we need. A nebula in the Dorias Cluster matches the particles on the probe. There is a class-four pulsar three light years from the nebula. Calculations indicate the probe was launched in the Xendi Kabu system. Plot a course. Take us out of orbit. Jean-Luc, come in. I think I need to talk to a parent. So, what's he like? I'm not sure that I can tell you. He puts up so many barriers, I have no idea what is underneath. He's had 20 years to be angry that his father wasn't there. It's gonna take time to get over those feelings. But I do think it's possible. Perhaps. But surely it would be wrong to force the issue. My sense is that he is a very independent young man. Perhaps it would be best if I left him alone. Let him come to me if he wants to. Maybe you're right. But I think you should consider this. Are you doing the best thing for Jason or what's easiest for you? Yeah? Hello, Jason. I'm Deanna Troi, Ship's Counsellor. Come in. Did Capt Picard ask you to come talk to me? No, I just thought I'd see how you were doing. A lot's happened in the last few hours. I thought you'd like to talk. I'll be alright. People have wanted to kill me before. But you've never met your father before. And I have to admit, I never thought I would. It must be somewhat overwhelming. I'm a little shaky. That's only natural. But you know what? I feel better already just talking to you. So how did you feel about the Captain, about your father? He's OK. A little stiff. But where are you from? I was born on Betazed. Do all the women there have eyes like yours? Jason, I came here to talk to you because I'm the Ship's Counsellor. If you don't want to talk to me in that way, then I should go. Fine. You can make an appointment to come to my office. Maybe I'll do just that. Picard! Can you hear me? I will kill him, Picard. And there's nothing you can do about it. Security. Captain's quarters, immediately. How could he have beamed through the shields? I'm not sure he did. Sensors show no sign of an intruder. Was it another hologram? I don't think so, Captain. Something has to generate a hologram. We would have detected it. Bok once used a mind-control device to make me hallucinate. That device emitted a specific energy signature. I'm not reading that. Could he have modified it so he could use it undetected? Possibly. I'll recalibrate to scan for low-intensity transmissions and sweep your quarters with a resonance scanner. Good. Keep me posted. Mr Worf, I want you to assign a security detail to Jason. And what about yourself? I am not the target of Bok's threats. Jason is. Captain, I have compiled all records about Jason Vigo's criminal record. Criminal record? Yes, sir. He has been charged three times with petty theft, twice for disorderly conduct, and several dozen times for trespassing. Trespassing? I believe the charges relate to his climbing activities in the caves beneath the planet's surface. This is the information you requested, is it not? Thank you, Mr Data. What was your name again? Lt Rhodes. Actually, I meant your first name. Sandra. Well, Sandra, do you think you could give me some room? We're supposed to be keeping an eye on you. Can't you do it from over there? Good morning. I thought you said your ship was the safest place to be. Why the guards? Because Bok appeared in my quarters last night. It might not have been him. It may have been an image. We're investigating. Look, just drop me off somewhere. I can watch out for myself. That wouldn't be wise. I've done it since I was 15. I'm sure you have, but Bok is a dangerous creature. He has a starship. He has technology... Alright. I'll stay here. You seem to like rock climbing. The holodeck can create very challenging climbs. I could go with you and show you how to use the program. Thanks, but I think I can figure it out myself. We could climb together. I'm probably not as skilled as you, but I'm not inexperienced. Look, I'm sorry. I appreciate what you're trying to do. But, Captain... Captain. Father. Jean-Luc. I don't know what I'm supposed to call you. As soon as this thing with Bok is over, I'm leaving. So don't you see? There really isn't any point in our getting acquainted. Let me know as soon as you catch him, alright? Captain's log, stardate 47829. 1. We've been in the X endi Kabu system for over three hours and still no sign of Bok. I'm detecting an object 5,000 kilometres off our starboard bow. It is another probe. Why didn't we detect it before? It must have been cloaked, sir. It came out of nowhere. On screen. Is it another holographic device? I do not believe so. The probe systems are overloading. Red alert. Shields up. Damage report. No damage, sir. I do not believe it was meant as an attack, but as a message. A message? Yes, sir. In B'zal, a Ferengi code using patterns of light and darkness. Can you translate it? I am attempting to do so. The message reads, ""My revenge is at hand."" He's proved that he can get to us whenever he wants. Why doesn't he do something? Tea, Earl Grey, hot. If you want me to stay and talk, you'd better not call Security this time. How do you like your boy, Captain? Is he everything you'd hoped for? It's a risky game, coming here. Next time, we'll be ready for you. Why don't we settle this now? And how do you propose to do that, Picard? You murdered my son! In self-defence. He fired on my ship. You were in Ferengi space. I didn't know that. If he'd told me, I would have withdrawn. I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do to bring him back. How touching. Your apology is worthless to me. I demand that you repay me for my loss. You cannot put a price on a life. But you can, Picard. You can pay me with your son's life. No. You don't have any choice. I insist on being paid. That should do it. Let's run a level-three bioscan to be sure. Rhodes to sickbay. Medical emergency, deck nine, section four. Let's go. Have you had any seizures like this before? No. Not really. Sometimes, my hand shakes, but never this bad. When did it first start to happen? A few months ago. Do you have any idea what's wrong with me? You have Forrester-Trent syndrome. It's a degenerative neurological disorder, very rare. What do you mean degenerative? If it goes untreated, it could result in paralysis, even death. I'm going to start you on a neuro-stabilisation regimen. If we're lucky, it will halt the degeneration and maybe reverse its effects. The disease is hereditary. Was your mother prone to these seizures? Not that I know of. There have been cases reported where the disease was instigated by a random mutation. I'll run a microcellular scan and see if that's what happened. In the meantime, I want you to try to take it easy and get some rest. Is he going to be alright? I wish I could say for certain. But I'm not sure how he'll respond to treatments. I've been thinking about what you said the other day and, you know, I think you were right. I had convinced myself that Jason didn't want me to reach out to him. You know, I don't think anyone is born knowing how to be a parent. You figure it out as you go. The one quality that's a requirement for parenthood is patience. Well, I'm not sure that that is going to be enough. I've found out that Jason has a criminal record. It's nothing very serious. It's only petty theft and so forth, but I can't help feeling that if I had been part of his life, then he wouldn't be so troubled now. Maybe. But why waste time blaming yourself for not being there? Just be here for him now. And be patient. And be patient. We think we've found something. Bok was in contact with this chair for an extended period. It is showing a distinctive subspace signature. We think he's using some kind of subspace transporter to beam aboard the Enterprise. My understanding is that such devices were impractical. The Federation abandoned its research because the technology was unreliable as well as energy intensive. To transport matter, you have to put it in a state of quantum flux. It's very unstable. What range would it have? It could operate over several light years. So the probe that exploded may have been beamed into position from outside sensor range. If Bok uses his transporter again, we might be able to trace its signature and locate his ship. Is there any way to keep Bok from beaming aboard the Enterprise again? I don't think there is. If he can beam aboard, he may be able to beam someone away. It is a possibility. I'm concerned he may try to take Jason. Can we protect him? We could keep a signal lock on him at all times. If Bok tries to beam him away, we might be able to hold him here. We would need to tie the ship's subspace field coils into the transporter system. Make it so. Computer, where is Jason Vigo? Jason Vigo is in holodeck four. Would you wait outside? Not bad. I like climbing. There's something about actually having your fate in your own hands. Yeah, I know. It looks as though we may have found out how to locate Bok's ship. This could all soon be over. You came up here just to tell me that? I thought it would make you feel better. Thanks. That was nice of you. Jason, when your mother and I parted, I lost track of her completely. But I would like to know what happened to her, if you'd tell me. Like what? How did you end up on Camor? It's an unlikely place for a woman and child. You know how she was. See a stray cat, take it in. See somebody cold, give them your coat. Yes. That was Miranda, alright. She'd heard about all the children orphaned on Camor, from the Cardassian war. I see. I was only ten when we went there. I remember her telling me all about the boys and girls that didn't have anyone to care for them. So she got this big house. Practically falling apart. Then she started rounding up children. Eventually, there were over 40 of us. She called it a school. You know, she got up before dawn every day and went to bed well after midnight. In between, she never stopped working. She taught us all how to read. And she grew vegetables in hardpan to feed us. And she made sure we knew how to sing. It's important in a place like Camor. And then, one day she was attacked... ...by two men in the street in broad daylight for the food she was carrying. If she'd just given it to them, they probably wouldn't have hurt her. But she knew how important the food was to us. So they killed her. I'm so sorry. Don't be sorry for me. My mother made sure we were tough enough to make it. Jason, isn't there some way that I can be a father to you? My own father and I were estranged. He wanted me to stay at home and tend the vineyards and I wanted to join Starfleet. And he died before we could come to terms with that. And I've regretted that all of my life. I don't want the same thing to happen to you and me. You don't understand. I'm not anybody you'd want for a son. Trust me, if you knew anything about me, you wouldn't be trying so hard. You're so wrong. Really? Let me spell it out for you. I've been in trouble since I was a teenager. I lie. I steal. I use people. I'm a criminal. That's what your son is. I know. You do? Yes. I know all about your troubles with the Camor authorities. You do? It doesn't make any difference, Jason. You're still my son. And, like it or not, I'm your father. I don't know what that means. I know it means something. There's some connection. Yeah. But one thing is clear. You'll never look at your hairline again in the same way. You wanted to see me. Yes. It's about Jason. I've finished the microcellular scan I was running. There's something you need to know. Sensors are detecting a subspace carrier wave headed for the ship. Its signature is consistent with Bok's transporter. See if you can trace it. Locate Bok's ship. Geordi, are you ready? I've got a signal lock on Jason. Riker to Picard. Picard here. Bok is trying to use his transporter. The transporter beam is focusing on deck nine, section four. Jason's quarters. I'm on it. Security to bridge. Bok is beaming Jason off the ship. Initiating transport now. I'm losing his signal. Bok is re-establishing his lock on him. Have you located Bok's ship? No, sir. The signature left by his transporter is decaying sooner than predicted. It may not be possible to trace it. Another probe has materialised 500 kilometres to starboard. It is sending a transmission. Put it on screen. This is a very special day, Picard. 15 years ago, you took my son away from me. Today, I will take your son away from you. It will be our anniversary. I wanted you to see him one last time. I'm tracing the transporter beam Bok used to send the probe. The ship is holding position 300 billion kilometres from here. Plot a course. Maximum warp. Even at warp nine, we wouldn't get there for another 20 minutes. The modifications you made to the transporter, can we use a subspace transport to get me on to Bok's ship? It may be possible, sir, but not advisable. I'll take that as a yes. You're with me. There. I've aligned the field coils. Phase dampers are in synch. Standing by to modulate the transport pattern. We might get you over there, but I don't see how we get you back. We'll deal with that later. Transport will take longer than normal. We have to shunt your pattern through subspace. Understood. Initiating transport sequence now. Maybe we can make a deal. What kind of deal? Tell my father you killed me. Put a phaser burn on my shirt and send it to him. He'll think I'm dead. That's what this is about, isn't it? I got friends on Camor V that will make it worth your while. I understand your desire to live. But I want Picard to see your body so there will be no doubt. Lower your weapons or Bok is dead! Lower yours or your son dies! You know as I do, Bok, he is not my son. I know what you've done. Miranda Vigo is his mother but I am not his father. You made it appear so because you resequenced his DNA. But your technique was flawed. He developed a neurological disorder. When my doctor investigated it, she discovered what you had done. Now he'll never pay the ransom. Shut up! There was no ransom. All he was interested in was vengeance. DaiMon, is this true? He's not a DaiMon! He was stripped of command. They had no right to do that to me! He lied to you, so you'd help him in his plan. The Enterprise is closing in on your position. If you let the two of us go, they won't attack you. They won't attack us with you on board. They will cripple your ship and keep you here until the Ferengi authorities arrive. You've got a lot of explaining to do. Your only hope is to turn Bok over to them and tell them that he deceived you. There is no profit in this for us. Captain's log, stardate 47831. 8. At Jason's request, the Enterprise has returned to Camor V. Dr Crusher feels I am responding well to the treatment. She thinks the damage may be reversed. I'm glad to hear it. Yeah. Are you sure you won't stay on board for a few more days? I can't. I have a life back on Camor. It's a mess. But I'd like to go back and straighten things out. I understand. Well, maybe next time you come back this way, you can look me up. I will. I put a little something into your bag while you were packing. I know you'd probably have preferred Saurian brandy, but that's all I could come up with. I can't accept this. I want you to have it. Energise. "
S7E23,"Graves at my command Have waked their sleepers... ...oped and let 'em forth By my so potent art. But this rough magic I here abjure, and, when I have required Some heavenly music, which even now I do, To work mine end upon their senses that This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff, Bury it certain fathoms in the earth. And deeper than did ever plummet sound, I'll... Captain? Sir, your attention is wandering. Data, I can barely see you. But, sir. I am supposed to be attempting a Neo-Platonic magical rite. The darkness is appropriate for such a ritual. But, Data, this is a play. The audience has to see you. Perhaps I have been too literal with my set design. Computer, modify holodeck program Data 73. Shakespeare's The Tempest, Act Five, Scene One. Increase torch light by 20 percent. There, that's better. Do you want to try it again? Yes, sir. Captain. I am not certain I fully understand this Prospero character. I would appreciate any insight you might have that would improve my performance. Well, Data. Shakespeare was witnessing the end of the Renaissance and the birth of the modern era. Prospero finds himself in a world where his powers are no longer needed. So, we see him here about to perform one final creative act before giving up his art forever. There is certainly a tragic aspect to the character. There's a certain expectancy, too. A hopefulness about the future. Shakespeare enjoyed mixing opposites. The past and the future. Hope and despair. Data, what is it? Is this part of your program? No, sir. What's going on? It appears to be a locomotive. A train? If I am not mistaken. Computer, end program. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. Captain. You are injured. Yes, I know. It's alright. I'll get it seen to, Data. The train we encountered was from one of Dr Crusher's programs. It was a recreation of the Orient Express, a train which travelled from Paris to Istanbul in the... Yes, I know about the train. But what is it doing on Prospero's island? There was a malfunction in the database retrieval program. The two programs temporarily linked together. Is it possible this will affect the other holodecks? It is a possibility. I will run a full diagnostic. Good. Shut down the other holodecks until you're finished, Just to be on the safe side. Aye, sir. I never realised you were interested in trains. Did you know that, at its peak, the Orient Express carried over 10,000 people a year? It isn't the train I'm interested in. What, then? It's the experience. The Orient Express is romantic, mysterious, an elegant way to see exotic places and meet fascinating people. On one trip, both Sigmund Freud and Gertrude Stein were in the same car. They had dinner together every night. I wonder what they talked about. Take a trip yourself and find out. Riker to Picard. Picard here. All sections ready to begin the survey, sir. Good. I'm on my way. Thank you. Don't forget the trip. Think about it. You never know who you'll meet on the Orient Express. Captain's log, stardate 47869.2. After weathering an unexpected magnascopic storm, we are continuing our search for new Federation colony sites. There's no possibility of developing sites here. Most of the stars are binaries. There are no M-class planets. Let's move on another survey region. Have stellar cartography... Mr Data, report. The ship has moved into warp. Who gave that command? Apparently, no one. Helm and navigation controls are not functioning. Our speed is warp 7.3 and holding. Picard to Engineering. Mr La Forge, what's going on? I don't understand it. The impulse system cut out and warp drive just kicked in. Can you take the engines off line? I'm working on it. Mr Data, what's our heading? Bearing 187, mark four, sir. I cannot determine our destination, but we are moving away from the Mekorda sector. Computer's locked out propulsion controls. I can't access the overrides. If you want to stop, I'll have to do an emergency core shutdown. That would leave us without warp power for over a week. Begin the procedure, Mr La Forge. We are no longer at warp, sir. Impulse power has resumed. All systems show normal. Where are we? We are 30 billion kilometres from our original position. Well done, Mr La Forge. It wasn't me. I didn't have time to complete the shutdown procedure. I want an explanation. Picard out. Have you found anything yet? Only that we seem to have more than one mystery here. I don't know why the ship jumped into warp, but we're lucky that it did. There was a data-flux distortion building up around the ship. Why didn't our sensors alert us? They're not designed to detect such distortion. And yet there is a record of the distortion in our sensor log. That's the other mystery. One fact is clear. The distortion was growing in strength. If we had remained at our position 1.7 seconds longer, it would have ruptured our warp core. If the Enterprise hadn't jumped into warp when it did, we would have been blown to pieces. I don't get it, Data. What would cause the engines to jump into warp? Perhaps they were activated by a random power fluctuation. Which occurred just in time to save the ship? It is improbable but it is possible. I don't know. I don't think I'm ready to start believing in luck. There is another possibility. Yeah, what's that? The sensors apparently detected a dangerous anomaly that threatened the Enterprise. Perhaps they triggered a safety device that caused the ship to avoid destruction. Yeah, but there's no direct link between the engines and the sensors. What is that? It looks like some kind of new circuit node. And it's connected to at least six points on the sensor array. It seems to be connected to several other systems, including the warp-control circuits. There's a connection between the warp engines and sensors after all. A force field. Where did that come from? I am not certain. Perhaps it came from the node itself. Well, wherever it came from, it doesn't want us messing with this node. It appears to be protecting itself. We found these nodes in several systems around the ship. At some level or another, they're all connected. These nodes linked the sensors to our warp control and defensive systems. We think this is why the ship jumped to warp. When the sensors detected danger, the defensive systems activated the warp engines to protect us. Where did the nodes come from? Possibly, the magnascopic storm we recently encountered affected the ship's systems. Wherever they're from, they seem to be multiplying. As they increase, it will become more difficult to control the ship. What do you propose we do? Getting rid of them won't be easy. When we tried to examine one of the nodes, it generated a force field to keep us out. Whatever's going on, our priority is getting back control of the ship. Agreed. All of the nodal connections intersect in holodeck three. It appears to be a focal point of some kind. We could use the holodeck circuitry to disable the nodes permanently. Alright. Let's do it. Commander, the holodeck appears to be in operation. I thought you shut down the entire system. I did, but it has reactivated itself and will not disengage. Which program is running? Several different ones are running simultaneously. This should be interesting. You weren't kidding, Mr Data. No, sir. I estimate that this scene consists of portions of seven distinct holodeck programs. See if you can access the circuits that have been affected by the nodes. Tickets, please. Please have your tickets ready. Thank you, sir. Thank you, madam. Tickets, please. I never even been away from home. Now I'm going to Vertiform City. Very nice, sir. Enjoy your trip. Tickets, please. Tickets. Thank you, sir. Commander. I have located a large concentration of nodes behind this wall They appear to be connected to the holodeck's main power coupling. Depolarise the entire power grid. It is located below this deck, sir. Get away from there. Would you gentlemen show me your tickets? I believe we left our tickets in our compartments. Mr Worf, I told you to bring them. I forgot. I don't think you folks belong on this train. Hold it. You leave these people alone. They're only trying to help. You go back to the engine. This doesn't concern you. They're all trying to hijack the train. If you're the engineer, who's doing the driving? I am. Easy, sir. Easy. I've got you. I'm alright. Thanks. It looks like the navigational relay has overloaded. Geordi, what's going on? We just went into warp. We've lost engine and helm control again. This time, they're completely burnt out. I don't know if we can stop the ship. I believe we have changed direction. Now we're on the right track. Ladies and gentlemen, we are on our way. I was right. He was trying to make off with my brick. Take good care of that. We can't afford to lose it. Now, are you people gonna leave, or do we have to throw you off? Commander. My tricorder says the holodeck safeties have been disengaged. His weapon could be lethal. Alright. Let's get out of here. The number of systems affected by the nodes has increased considerably. Sensors, engines, replicators, propulsion, they're working together, almost independently of the computer. And the nodes link them all through the holodeck. Why the holodeck? It doesn't make sense. I believe what happens on the holodeck directly affects the ship. When we tried to destroy the nodes, the characters on the train responded immediately to stop us. When the engineer tried to protect us, one of the characters shot him. Then the conductor signalled the train to change direction And at the same time... The Enterprise changed direction. The ship is under the control of the holodeck? Not precisely. Geordi, does the configuration of connection nodes look familiar? Yeah! It looks a little like the structure of your positronic brain. Correct. The nodes are in the process of creating a rudimentary neural net. Data, what are you suggesting? Unlikely as it may sound, I believe the Enterprise may be forming an intelligence. This is a synaptic map of the human neo-cortex, this is a cross section of my positronic net. This is a schematic of the connection nodes linking the ship's systems. I believe some sort of neural matrix is forming on the ship. It is relatively primitive, but still an intelligence. How could that happen? It is an emergent property. Explain. Complex systems can behave in ways that are entirely unpredictable. The human brain, for example, might be described in terms of cellular functions and neurochemical interactions. But that description does not explain human consciousness, a capacity that far exceeds simple neural functions. Consciousness is an emergent property. Something that's more than the sum of its parts. Exactly. How does that explain what's happening? The Enterprise contains a vast database of information managed by a sophisticated computer. This complex system gives the ship many characteristics of a biological organism. True. It sees with sensors and talks with communications systems. In a sense it almost reproduces with the replicators. And you think the ship is developing a new capacity? Yes, sir. I think a self-determining intelligence is emerging. If that is so, what does the ship want? Where is it taking us? The key to understanding the ship's behaviour is in the holodeck. All the nodes intersect there. It is clearly the processing centre. Processing centre? Yes, sir. A focal point where the ideas and instincts of this intelligence are first expressed in some form. Almost like an imagination. Captain, I'd like to go to the holodeck. I could interact with the characters, maybe find clues to help us understand what's happening. Very well. Mr Data, Mr Worf, go along. Try to re-establish control of the ship without damaging the nodes. If the ship is truly an emerging intelligence, then we have a responsibility to treat it with the same respect as any other being. Welcome aboard, Counsellor. If you distract these people, I will try to depolarise the power grid. Excuse me. Have you finished the puzzle yet? Not yet, but we're getting close. Do you recognise it? No. I would like to help. Tell me, what exactly are you making? What do you think we're making? A puzzle. No. I meant the picture. What is it? Well, I don't know. Can you deal me in? Sorry. It's a two-man game. Get your hand off that. Is that why you killed the engineer? To get this brick? I had to get it back. You know what it's worth, lady? Plenty. And I gotta get it to Keystone City. Why, what's Keystone City? It's where everything begins. Gin. Are you succeeding, Commander? I am ready to access the main power grid. Keystone City, next stop. Keystone City. Well, look who's back. We do not want any trouble. We are simply passengers. Then I'm sure you wouldn't mind showing me your tickets. Right, sorry, boys. You're getting off right here. This is my stop. What happens at Keystone City? Why are you taking the brick there? Excuse me. We should follow that man. The brick might be an important clue. Where did he go? I can access the power grid here. I will try to depolarise the grid with a low-frequency inversion field. It may disengage the nodes without destroying them. There he is. I'm going after him. What are you doing here? Laying the foundation. Now, if you'll excuse me, I got a train to catch. All of a sudden, cargo bay five started to depressurise. Did everyone get out? Yes, sir. But I'm reading massive power surges in the cargo bay, and lots of transporter activity. Something weird is happening there. Send a team down there immediately. Find out what's going on. La Forge to bridge. Picard here. What's going on? I wish I could tell you. That man said he was laying a foundation. Foundation for what? Troi to Data. Data here. How are you doing? I encountered a minor difficulty, but it has been dealt with. I am ready to depolarise the power grid. It looks like the ship's replicator and transporter systems have been merged somehow to create this. The question is, what is it? Ensign, I want you to run a full spectral analysis on this... I'm reading massive power fluctuations. The ship is losing its structural integrity. What's happening? It's an earthquake. La Forge to Data. Stop what you're doing. Acknowledged. Are you alright? I'm fine. Data, we ought to get together and compare notes. Agreed. The ship was protecting itself again. Stopping us from interfering. Whatever it's doing, it intends to continue. This must have something to do with that object in the cargo bay. He's right. Look at the common themes playing out on the holodeck. A puzzle being put together, a foundation being laid, a paper doll being fashioned. They're all images of something being constructed. And some kind of object in the cargo bay that's being constructed atom by atom. What is that object? I've no idea, but it's composed of silica polymers, duranium and other compounds we haven't identified yet. But creating it has had an effect on our systems. Warp power has dropped 47 percent. Did you draw any other conclusions from your experiences on the holodeck? Anything that would help us understand this situation? The holodeck was full of metaphoric imagery, like it was having some kind of daydream. It may not make literal sense, but symbolically, it probably has some kind of logic to it. These characters you spoke to, do they have any significance? I think they represent different aspects of the ship. The engineer may represent the navigation system, the gunslinger could be the weapons system. Could we persuade them to give us back control of the ship? I don't think it's possible to reason with them. Many of them are genuinely unaware of what's going on. This emergent intelligence seems like an infant acting on impulse, trying to figure itself out as it goes. The only source of experience it can draw on is ours, through our holodeck programs. Could we relate to them on their own level, find some way to influence their behaviour? Maybe there is. I'd like to go back and try. Counsellor, we haven't re-established the safeties. The injuries you suffered on the holodeck weren't severe, but next time they might kill you. I'm aware of that. Very well, Counsellor, go ahead. But bear in mind, whenever we have tried to hinder their efforts, we've failed. Perhaps it's time to cooperate with them. You don't belong on this train. Three tickets for Vertiform City. Well, I guess I was wrong about you folks. Welcome aboard. What was that? We've been having some problems. The engine is running out of steam. I hope we make it to Vertiform City on time. Is there anything we can do to help? I could use a pair of strong arms in the engine room. Might help us get back on schedule. Why don't you go with him, Worf? We'll see what we can do here. Excuse me. Are we gonna get there OK? Of course, you needn't worry about a thing. So, tell me everything you know about Vertiform City. Well, they got this restaurant there where you can eat all you want. It's the best food around. There's the coal and there's the boiler. I'm much obliged for your help. Well done, sir. I think this'll make a big difference. I don't know how or why, sir, but warp power is back to normal. What's our heading? We appear to be on a course for Tambor Beta VI, a white dwarf star. Keep it steady. Put your back into it. That's the ticket. The ship is using a tractor beam to collect vertion particles from the star. Vertion particles? Vertiform City. That's what the ship was looking for. The particles are being routed into cargo bay five. Geordi, what's going on? The object is absorbing vertion particles. It's growing even faster than before. Commander, I'm picking up internal energy from this thing. What do you mean? I mean it's generating its own energy. I'm picking up coherent emissions, matter conversion. It's incredible. Wait a minute. Something's wrong. We've got power fluctuations. Vertion absorption rate is dropping. What's happening with the particle beam? The beam's exhausted the particles from the star. There's nothing left. Captain, energy output of the object is decreasing. Something's wrong. What is it? This was supposed to be Vertiform City. We've been on the wrong track all along. Are you alright? Yes. What happened? The conductor derailed the train. Data to Capt Picard. Picard here. There's been an accident here. Has anything happened to you? Yes, we've had a ship-wide shutdown. Most systems are off line. Captain, you'd better take a look at this. When the particle beam cut off, the object was beginning to form a coherent energy matrix. If these are accurate, the emission patterns were almost organic. You're saying the ship is trying to create a life form? I think so. Will it survive? Its energy levels are dropping. Unless it gets an infusion of vertion particles soon, I don't think so. All systems are back on line. We're moving again, at warp nine. Let's get back to the bridge. That was a close one, wasn't it? Where are we going now? New Vertiform City, of course. Data to Captain. Picard here. The train is back to normal. Our destination is New Vertiform City. What's our course? The Cordannas system. Another white dwarf star. It's the nearest one. Captain, we have a problem. Even at warp nine, the Cordannas system is over 12 hours from here. Will the object survive that long? Yes, but that's not the problem. The ship has diverted all systems to propulsion, including life-support. We have less than two hours of reserve oxygen. Mr Data, we must stop the Enterprise. You have to get control of the train. Understood. The ship is looking for vertion particles. It believes Cordannas is the closest source. Might there be anything closer? White dwarf stars are the only natural source, sir. Then what about artificial ones? Can you create the particles? How did he stop the train? There's a brake in the engine room. Let's go. Sorry, folks You ain't going nowhere. I've narrowed it down to the MacPherson Nebula, a supernova remnant, and Dikon Alpha, a class-nine pulsar. Either one could produce vertion particles if we detonated a modified torpedo inside it. Vertions usually occur in minuscule amounts. Could these produce enough? It's hard to say. I can't guarantee that we can create them at all. We've got to try. The nebula or the pulsar. It's your choice. I say go with the nebula. Very well. Begin the torpedo modifications. Now let's see if we can get the ship to go where we want. Please listen to me. We understand what's happening. We know you have to get to New Vertiform City, and we want to help. Well, I don't know. Please, we're your friends. You're really gonna help us? I promise. OK. But just one of you. The rest stay here. That's far enough. Sorry to spoil your party, pal. I can get us there more quickly. I know a shorter route. Don't listen. He's up to something. A shorter route? Yes, if I can handle the controls. Don't do it. Well, we're already behind schedule. If you can get us there on time... Alright, go on, but no funny stuff. Data to Capt Picard. I have taken control of the train. Stand by. Are we within sensor range of the nebula? Yes, Captain, we are. Mr Data, slow us to impulse speed. I will attempt to do so. I hope you know what you're doing. Are the modifications to the torpedoes complete? Aye, sir. Launch torpedo. It's working, Captain. The reaction is producing vertion particles. Well, what do know? We're here! New Vertiform City. The nodes are deactivating. All our systems are functioning normally. The purpose of the ship's intelligence was simply to bring this life form into being. There are some species whose sole purpose is to reproduce. Once they procreate, they die. Captain. Captain's log, supplemental. The Enterprise is back under our control. All traces of the emergent intelligence are gone, and the object it created has disappeared into space. Come. Captain, I am staging a scene from The Tempest tonight for a small audience. I would like you to attend. I'd be honoured. What scene? Miranda's first encounter with other human beings. ""O brave new world, That has such people in't."" It seemed appropriate. Captain, you took a substantial risk in allowing the Enterprise to complete its task. Why do you say that? Because the end result was unknown. The object could have been dangerous. It may in fact be dangerous. And I have allowed it to go off on its merry way. Yes, sir. The intelligence that was formed didn't just come out of the ship's systems. It came from us. Our mission records, personal logs, holodeck programs, our fantasies. If our experiences with the Enterprise have been honourable, can't we trust that the sum of those experiences will be the same? "
S7E24,"Captain's log, stardate 47941.7. The Enterprise is en route to a briefing on the situation in the Demilitarised Zone along the Cardassian border. Meanwhile, we're celebrating the return of an old friend. Ro! Welcome home. Thanks. It's good to be back. Congratulations on your promotion, Lieutenant. Same to you, Commander. Thanks. I understand Advanced Tactical Training is a picnic. Right! Did you see the buffet? This is real Bajoran foraiga. It wasn't easy to get. You shouldn't have gone to all this trouble. We wanted you to know how glad we are to have you back. So, where are your new quarters? Deck four, section eight. What do you plan to do? Lt Ro. Go ahead, sir. Please report to the bridge. Yes, sir. Excuse me. Captain. You seemed a bit overwhelmed by the attention. To tell you the truth, I really want to see everyone, I would just rather do it one at a time. You look very fit. Tactical Training seems to agree with you. You know me, I enjoy a challenge. More than a challenge. Half the class washes out every year. But somehow, I didn't think you would be one of those. Captain... ...I want you to know I really appreciate your recommending me. If not for you, my life would be very different right now. Bridge to Picard. Go ahead. We have a distress signal from a Cardassian ship near the Demilitarised Zone. Change course to intercept. I'm on my way. I... I'd like you at the conn, Lieutenant. Ensign Gates. Report. The distress signal was cut off before we found out what was wrong. I have the ship on sensors. It seems to be under attack by several small ships. Can you identify them? No, sir. No identification codes. I will scan their warp signatures. Sir, sensors indicate the attacking vessels are Federation ships. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. We're coming into visual range. On screen. Those are Federation ships. Isolate one and magnify. The Maquis. Open a channel. Open. To all Maquis ships, call off your attack or we will be forced to engage you. No response. You are Federation citizens. Your actions violate our treaty with the Cardassians. Call off your attack! They are not responding, sir. Mr Worf, are we in firing range? Not yet, sir. Arm phasers and photon torpedoes. I never thought we'd fire on our own people to protect Cardassians! The Maquis ships are regrouping and closing in on the Cardassians. Cardassian shields are down to 30 percent. They may not withstand another hit. We are within weapons range. Can you detonate a torpedo spread between Maquis and the Cardassians? Yes, sir. Do it. The Maquis are breaking formation. They are withdrawing. Signal the Cardassians that we are standing by to assist any wounded. Aye, sir. Do you people have experience treating Cardassians? Yes. Do you mind? Gul Evek. I am sorry we could not come to your aid sooner. I suppose we're lucky you came at all. Starfleet looks the other way when the Maquis attack. That is not the case. We are doing everything we can to control them. That attack suggests your efforts have met with limited success. They used photon torpedoes and type-eight phasers. Now tell me, Captain, how do you suppose a group of civilians acquired such weaponry? I assure you, not through official channels. The fact that some Maquis are former Starfleet officers has nothing to do with it? Starfleet does not condone Maquis actions in the Demilitarised Zone any more than your government would condone paramilitary actions by Cardassian civilians. We have dealt with our colonists who armed themselves. As they destroyed a Juhrayan freighter a week ago, I would say your efforts have met with limited success. If the Maquis are not stopped, the situation will continue to escalate and the Cardassian military will have no choice but to take matters into their own hands. Captain's log, supplemental. Gul Evek and his crew have left the Enterprise. We have proceeded to our rendezvous with Admiral Nechayev. No Bularian canapés this time? I thought twice was pushing it. It's just as well, they're extremely fattening. You only missed Gul Evek by hours. I asked him to stay. I thought an Admiral's assurances might convince him we are trying to deal with the Maquis. Evek manages to make the Cardassians sound like helpless sheep being preyed on by Federation wolves. But we caught the Cardassians supplying their colonies in the Demilitarised Zone with weapons. Gul Evek told me they had stopped that practice. How comforting. Admiral, this Maquis situation has you worried. If I were living that close to the Cardassians, I'd keep a phaser under my pillow, too. But in the last weeks, we've seen signs that the Maquis are moving beyond self-defence. Their ranks are growing. They're acquiring ships, weapons. They seem to be preparing a more aggressive military posture. We've got to put a stop to them before the entire Demilitarised Zone ignites. But before we stop them, we have to find them. They seem to be scattered in small cells around the Zone. We don't have reliable intelligence about them. Perhaps you need an undercover operative. Our thinking exactly. We intend to infiltrate their organisation, and the person we want to do it is aboard your ship right now. Starfleet wants me to infiltrate the Maquis? Because of your recent training, because you're Bajoran, and because of your past troubles with Starfleet gives you a certain credibility. Well, that's certainly true. Just how soon would this mission begin? Immediately. I see. I've spent the better part of my life fighting the Cardassians. I never thought I'd be helping them out. This is a rare case when our interests and theirs coincide. We both want peace in the Demilitarised Zone I've heard a lot about the Maquis. One of my instructors at Tactical Training, a lieutenant commander in Starfleet, a man I both admired and respected, he was sympathetic to them. He resigned and left to join them. We're all sympathetic, Lieutenant. Our civilians in the Demilitarised Zone are in a difficult situation, but even sympathy must end at some point. The peace treaty isn't just a piece of paper. If the Maquis force us into a war with Cardassia, it may mean hundreds of thousands of lives. Two years ago, Starfleet would never have tapped you for this mission. They must have a lot of confidence in you now. The way I see it, there's one good reason to take this mission, and that's to validate your faith in me. We are looking for a Bajoran woman, dark hair. She is responsible for the death of a Cardassian soldier. If we learn she has been here, this establishment will be closed down. You say she has dark hair? Yes. She was here. Just missed her. Do you know where she went? No. It was really nice meeting you. Thanks. So, did you kill that Cardassian? Starfleet thinks I did. That's reason enough to hide. Why did you tell them that I'd left? There are worse things a person can do than kill a Cardassian soldier. You don't often meet someone willing to say that out loud. In the Zone, a lot of us feel that way. I'd like to meet people like that. Don't be afraid. You're not in danger here. What is your name? Did you kill that Cardassian? Who are you? We're the people who saved you from Starfleet. Thanks, but I'll be going now. Did you kill that Cardassian? Yes. That's a risky thing to do in the Demilitarised Zone. You can end up hunted by Starfleet and the Cardassians. Then why did he risk bringing me here? We're asking the questions. Who are you? My name is Ro Laren. I grew up in the Bajoran camps. That would explain why you have no love for Cardassians. I know what they're capable of. They tortured my father to death, and I was forced to watch. Where are you living now? Nowhere. I was a Starfleet officer, but I was court-martialled and I was sent to the stockade on Jaros II. I'm not exactly what you'd call Starfleet material. When were you on Jaros? What difference does it make? We want to check your story. When were you there? Starfleet let me out three years ago because I agreed to do work for them, mostly to do with Bajor. But I got tired of watching them placate the Cardassians, and so I left. You resigned? Not officially. That's part of the reason why they're looking for me. What were you doing on Ornara? I think I've answered enough questions. I'd like to know who you people are. Let's say that we sympathise with those who oppose Cardassia. Are you Maquis? What if we were? If you were, I would ask if I could join you and help you fight. We'll check your story. Go ahead. I'll keep an eye on her. Come. Let's stretch our legs. Aren't you taking a chance by letting me see all of this? What if my story doesn't check out? What if I'm not who I say I am? Well, then we'll have a problem, won't we? You are Maquis, aren't you? Many of the people here are. Starfleet considers you outlaws. They fear you'll destroy the peace treaty. They don't understand the situation here in the Zone. I lived on Juhraya. When the treaty was signed, the colony suddenly found itself in Cardassian territory. Some of us chose to stay, take our chances. Then one night, I was dragged from my bed and beaten. The authorities clucked their tongues and agreed it was an unfortunate incident, and did nothing! I'm not surprised. The Cardassians intend to make life so bad for Federation citizens that they'll leave. Exactly, but no one seems to see that! Except the Maquis. How old were you when your father was killed? I'd rather not talk about that. Hungry? Would you like something? No, thank you. Hasperat. You like hasperat? An old Bajoran friend of mine used to make it. His was stronger. He was killed many years ago, fighting the Cardassian occupation of Bajor. I miss his company. And his hasperat. My father used to make the strongest hasperat you've ever tasted. Everything else seems mild by comparison. Did he teach you how to make it? Yes. But I haven't tried it in years. If you would make the brine for a really strong hasperat, I mean, eye-watering, tongue-searing strong, you'd make an old man very happy. I would enjoy making it again. Macias? I've checked with my sources at Starfleet. Her story's true. I was sure it was. Kalita, she'll stay with you, until we can find her a room. There you are. We've just heard a disturbing rumour. Another rumour? One that I think we should take seriously. A traitor coming from Pendi II said he could verify that the Cardassians will give their colonists biogenic weapons. I thought shipments entering the Zone were searched. The Cardassians always seem to find a way around that problem. Then we have to make a pre-emptive strike, show the Cardassians we won't sit still while they kill us with toxins. Agreed. But we can't mount a strike without medical supplies, and our stockpile is dangerously low. If we request more, it will draw suspicion. I can get medical supplies. I served on the Enterprise. They always had extra medkits for relief missions. They're not going to give you medkits just because you ask for them. I don't intend to ask. I intend to take them. How? The Enterprise is a fortress. I know its security systems. Give me a ship. I can do this. This is madness. We can't let her do something like this. We know nothing about her. I know that she can make very strong hasperat. What? We need medical supplies. I think we should let her try. Alright. But I'm going with her. I could use an extra hand at the controls. And a witness. I've set the transporter confinement parameters to maximum. We'll be able to fill our hold with medical supplies with one beam-out. I had no idea it was going to be so easy. Approaching Federation border. How will you leave the Demilitarised Zone and not be searched at a checkpoint? We're going to cross the border here. There are sensor buoys all along the border. If we don't cross at a checkpoint, Starfleet will investigate. With the right security codes we can disable the detectors on the buoys. Starfleet changes codes constantly. I know the encryption algorithms. If I can access the buoy's protocols I should be able to find the codes. ""Should be able to?"" Do you want this mission to succeed? Of course I do. We need those medical supplies. In that case, let me do my job. I'm in. What's wrong? If I don't input the right code in 20 seconds, we'll trigger the alarm. I'm getting out of range. Don't! If we break the commlink, we won't be able to try again. It worked. Until they change the codes again, we can cross the border here. Captain's log, stardate, 47943.2. It has been over a week since Lt Ro left the Enterprise. We have yet to receive any communication from her. We picked up a request for help from a science ship in the Topin system. Are there other ships nearby? We're the closest. Helm, set a course for the Topin system. Mr Data, signal the science ship we're on our way. It is unlikely they would receive our signal. The Topin system contains an unstable protostar. It generates magnetascopic interference. Can we use sensors to find them? Most of our sensors will not work. Our directional array may pierce the interference. That array has such a narrow scan field. Might as well break out the palm beacons and find them that way. This is insane. We're sitting here, no sensors, blind to the outside, waiting for a Galaxy-class starship to come swooping down on us. Don't worry. It's hard for them to locate us with just directional sensors. Besides, they're looking for a science ship that wants to be found. They're here. Stand by to engage thrusters. Anything? No, sir. It will take six hours to scan the system. Captain, the distress call is being repeated. Data, can you locate the signal? I am attempting to do so. They're scanning our last position. I've locked on to their sensor beam. I'll use it to manoeuvre into transporter range. How do we beam through the shields? We can't. To get those supplies, we have to take this ship through their shields. Sir, I am scanning the area from which the distress signal was sent, but I am unable to detect a vessel. Captain, the computer has detected a piggyback communication on the last signal. Can you decode it? It will take a few moments. Do it. The shields have a weak point. When at impulse, the thrust destabilises the shield here. I'll try to punch through there. Won't they detect us? They'll know something's there, but will take a few seconds to find us. We'll have to beam the supplies aboard and get out fast. The message is difficult to decode. Interference has garbled much of the transmission, but it seems to be coming from Lt Ro. Ro is on that ship! Sir, a vessel is attempting to penetrate our aft shields. Let it through. We're going to make it. Alright. We're in. Energising. Let's get outta here. Captain, medical supplies were beamed from cargo bay seven. The vessel that penetrated our shields is of the same design as ships used by the Maquis. It is moving off. Let it go. There must be someone with her. We should make it look as though we're trying to stop them. Mr Worf, lock phasers on their previous position and fire. Aye, sir. Now we know what they mean by ""Advanced"" Tactical Training. You went through their shields? Ro parked us between their warp nacelles. I thought she was crazy, but it worked. She knew what she was doing. Well done! I have to inventory supplies and find out what we have. See you later. It seems Kalita has decided you're not a Federation spy after all. She's suspicious of everyone at first. And rightly so. We've learned to be cautious of strangers. No, I understand. But I've known since I first met you that in your heart, you're one of us. Captain's log, supplemental. Having earned the Maquis's trust with her raid on the Enterprise, Lt Ro has been given access to a ship and allowed to leave the settlement alone. It's rumoured the Cardassians are supplying their colonists with biogenic weapons. I find that hard to believe. Ships that enter the Demilitarised Zone are searched. The Maquis are convinced the Cardassians avoid the searches. We could make use of that. Sir? We have come up with a plan that has the potential to seriously curtail the Maquis. We want to give them a target so threatening that they'll be willing to commit as many ships and people as possible in order to destroy it. Give them a target? Biogenic weapons, for example. You could provide them with intelligence which would show that the Cardassians are, in fact, supplying their colonists with them. That would get their attention. You could say that to get past the checkpoints, they ship the components for weapons through third parties, and then we could put together a convoy and send it towards the Demilitarised Zone. And when the Maquis attack it, Starfleet would be waiting for them. We could station our ships in the Hugora Nebula to avoid detection. Basically, I would be leading them into a trap. That's right. If you have a problem with any of this, I need to know it now. Well, if I do, sir, it will not stop me from carrying out my duty. I knew that I could count on you. It took a while, but I patched into Starfleet's comm system. I intercepted a communication from a checkpoint. They're concerned. A Pakled transport came through carrying retroviral vaccines. Why is that a concern? Last week, a Ferengi transport came through carrying biomimetic gels. By themselves, neither of these is dangerous, but Starfleet is concerned because, with other components, the Cardassians could put together a biogenic device. What is Starfleet doing about it? They can't do anything. These items are all perfectly legal. How close are the Cardassians to having the components they need? Very close. Two days ago, a Yridian convoy left Deep Space Nine for the Demilitarised Zone. It's carrying isomiotic hypos, plasma flares and quarantine pods. We can't let it reach its destination. But it's too big for us to go after alone. I'll discuss the situation with the other cell leaders. Considering what's at stake, they'll want to help. I've sent a communication to the others. When this is over, we'll celebrate. When it's over? When Cardassia realises they can't intimidate us into leaving. Something tells me it will be a long time before we're celebrating. Don't be discouraged, Ro. It'll take time. But the important thing is that we not give up. I spent ten years in the camps. I don't give up. I've been thinking a long time about what our celebration will be like. We'll have a huge dinner. You'll make hasperat and I'll make blueberry pie. We'll drink wine and we'll dance. I'll even play the belaklavion. That'll give everyone a laugh. You play the klavion? Yes, badly. It's a difficult instrument, but I enjoy the challenge. My father played the klavion. When I was very young, and afraid of monsters under my bed... ...he'd play for me. He said that the klavion had special powers. Monsters were afraid of it... ...and when they heard it, they disappeared. When I listened to that music he played for me... ...I was never afraid to go to sleep. When he died... ...I realised even he couldn't make all the monsters go away. Why wait? Let's go to the market. Let's get food for a feast, for a celebration. A celebration of what? Of absolutely nothing. Just to celebrate. I'd like that. Come. Let's go to the market. If I'm to make a pie, we'll have to find a substitute for blueberries. Haven't seen real ones in years. On Bajor, there's a berry... Yes, I know it, very sweet. Ro! Macias? They must have discovered that there was a Maquis cell here. Kalita, get one of the medkits. Hurry! You have to hang on. When an old fighter like me dies... ...someone always steps forward to take his place. Not tonight. Hello. Are you alone? I hope not. Let's get acquainted? There's a table in the back that's more private. I'd like that. We have to cancel the mission. Why? The Maquis didn't go for the bait. They think the convoy is too big a target. But there are only six ships. We could even cut back that number. It's the commitment of resources, of grouping so many of the Maquis together at once. They feel it makes them vulnerable. Every intelligence report that I get from Starfleet suggests that the Maquis are eager to expand their strikes, they want to escalate their activities. Now you're telling me this isn't true? It's probably different in every cell. The people I've met tend to be more conservative. I'm sure others have a more militant attitude. Laren, what's going on? Do you have the money I asked you to bring? Yes. Put some on the table. What? By this time, you should be negotiating my price. When you sent me on this mission... ...I thought that I could do it. Even though it meant helping the Cardassians and betraying people who are fighting against them. Now I'm not sure where I stand. Do you want to back out of this mission? Sir, I don't wanna let you down, I swear. This has nothing to do with me. This is about you. If you back out now, you'll throw away everything you've worked for. We're committed to this mission. My only question for you is... ...can you carry out your orders? I could put you before a board of inquiry for having lied to me about this operation. I would certainly have you court-martialled if you sabotage it. Now, it's your decision. I'll carry out my orders, sir. I feel it necessary to have Cmdr Riker go back with you. He can pose as a relative. I just want to make sure that nothing happens to obstruct this mission. I'm sorry. I don't have that kind of money. Captain's log, supplemental. We have received word from Cmdr Riker and Lt Ro that the Maquis will attack the convoy as planned. Our ships have taken up position in the Hugora Nebula to wait for them. I have established a link with the probe we left on the perimeter of the nebula. This is the convoy. We expect the Maquis attack force to cross from the Demilitarised Zone. As soon as they cross, we'll intercept them. To ensure the ship Cmdr Riker and Lt Ro are piloting is not fired upon, I have relayed their warp signature to the attack force. Sir, the Maquis squadron is coming into sensor range. Go to red alert. Aye, sir. Squad Leader to all ships. Go ahead, Squad Leader. We'll be crossing the border in less than one minute. Arm your weapons. Acknowledged. Starfleet can't make its move until we're out of the Demilitarised Zone. We'll break formation and take cover in the nebula when they appear. The ships in the convoy are raising their shields. They've spotted us. We cross the border in 30 seconds. What the...? I'm sorry. I can't let this happen. Sir, the vessel being piloted by Lt Ro is firing a low-intensity particle beam into the nebula. What the hell is she doing? The polarising effect of the beam may make us detectable. Can you counter the effect? I will attempt to do so. Ro, why are you firing? Scan the nebula. There's a Starfleet attack force hiding in it. I see it! Squad Leader to all ships. Abort the mission. Repeat, abort the mission! Sir, the Maquis ships are breaking formation. Have they crossed the border? No, sir. They are withdrawing. Captain, Lt Ro's ship is not retreating with the others. It is heading towards us. When she comes aboard, take her into custody. Alpha seven to Alpha nine. Go ahead. Stand by to beam me aboard. Standing by. Take the ship back to the Enterprise. You're going with them? It's been a long time since I really felt I belonged somewhere. Could you tell Capt Picard something for me? Of course. What is it? Tell him I'm sorry. So long, Ro. Take care of yourself. Goodbye, Will. Energise. She seemed very sure that she was doing the right thing. I think her only regret was that she let you down. Here's my report. "
S7E25-26,"That was an incredible program! I am glad you approve. I have always found the Black Sea at night to be most stimulating. Worf, we were walking barefoot on the beach with balalaika music in the air, an ocean breeze washing over us, stars in the sky, a full moon rising, and the most you say is ""stimulating""? It was... ...very stimulating. What? I don't spend nearly enough time on the holodeck. I should take my own advice and go there to relax. Next time, I'll choose the program. If you like the Black Sea, you'll love Lake Cataria on Betazed. Deanna, perhaps before the next time, we should discuss Cmdr Riker. Why? Is he coming along? No. But I do not wish... It would be unfortunate if he... If you and I are going to continue, I do not wish to hurt his feelings. Worf, I think it's alright to concentrate on our feelings, yours and mine. Counsellor! What's today's date? The date! Stardate 47988. 47988... Captain, what's wrong? 47988. I'm not sure. I don't know how or why, but... ...l'm moving back and forth through time! Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds... ...to seek out new life and new civilisations... ...to boldly go where no one has gone before. I felt as if I had physically left the Enterprise. I was in another time, another place. I was somewhere in the past. Can you describe where you were? What it looked like? You see, it's all slipping away so fast. It's like... It's like waking up from a nightmare. I... It was years ago, before I took command of the Enterprise. I was talking to someone, I can't remember who! And then it all changed. I was no longer in the past. I was now an old man in the future. And I was outside and I was doing something. I can't remember what it was. I'm sorry. It's all gone. I just can't remember. It's alright. Have you considered that this might be just a dream? No, it was much more than a dream. The smells, the sounds, the very touch of things... ...much more real than a dream. How long did you spend in each time period? Did it seem like minutes, hours? You see, I can't say. At first, I had a sense of confusion, disorientation. I wasn't sure where I was. And then, all that passed and it all seemed perfectly natural, as though I belonged in that time. But I can't... Capt Picard to the bridge! Captain, we've got a problem with the warp core or the phase inducers or some other damn thing! Geordi! Hello, Captain, or should I call you Ambassador? I haven't been called that for some time, either. How about Mr Picard? How about Jean-Luc? I don't think I could get used to that. Good Lord. Geordi. Well! How long has it been? Nine years. No, no, no! Since you last called me Captain, since we were all together on the Enterprise? Close to 25 years. 25 years! Well, time has been good to you. A little too good in some places. Can I give you a hand here? Well, I'm just tying up some vines. You've got leaf miners. You might want to try a bacillus spray. My wife is quite a gardener. I've picked up a little bit of it. How is Leah? Just wonderful. Busy as ever. She's just been made director of the Daystrom Institute. What about the little ones? Brett, Alandra and... Sydney. Sydney. Well, they're not so little any more. Brett is applying to Starfleet Academy next year. So, what brings you here? I just thought I'd stop by. Been thinking about the old days on the Enterprise. I was in the neighbourhood... Geordi. You don't make the trip from Rigel III to Earth just to drop by. No. So, you've heard? Leah's got a few friends at Starfleet Medical. Word gets around. I'm not an invalid. Irumodic Syndrome can take years to run its course. I know. Once I heard, well, I just wanted to stop by just the same. Well, now you're here, you can carry those tools. My cooking may not be up to Leah's standards but I can still make a decent cup of tea. I read your last novel. I thought that the protagonist was a little too flamboyant but... Captain, are you alright? Captain! Captain? Will this be your first time on a Galaxy-class starship? Are you alright, sir? Sir? I'm sorry, Lieutenant. My mind must have wandered. What were you saying? I asked if you'd ever been aboard a Galaxy-class starship before. No. Of course, I'm familiar with the blueprints and specifications, but this will be my first time on board. Well then, if I may be so bold, sir, you're in for a treat. The Enterprise is quite a ship. I'm sure she is. Have I done something wrong, sir? No. It's just that you look very familiar. Enterprise to shuttlecraft Galileo, you are cleared for arrival In shuttlebay two. Acknowledged, Enterprise. And there she is. Captain? Captain? Tasha. I was just with Tasha in the shuttle. I've finished the neurographic scan. I found nothing that would cause hallucinations or psychogenic reaction. Any sign of temporal displacement? No. That would leave a tripamine residue, in the cerebral cortex but the scan didn't show any. Personally, I think you just enjoy waking everybody up. Actually, I really like running around the ship in my bare feet. The biospectral test results, Doctor. Your blood-gas analysis shows you've been breathing the ship's air for weeks. If you'd been anywhere else, there'd be a change in the oxygen-isotope ratios. Thanks. Deanna, would you excuse us? Of course. Jean-Luc, I scanned you for evidence of Irumodic Syndrome as you suggested. There wasn't any. But I did find a small structural defect in the parietal lobe. A defect that you hadn't noticed before? This kind of defect only shows up on a level-four neurographic scan. It could make you susceptible to several neurological disorders including Irumodic Syndrome. Now, it's possible you'll live without ever developing a problem. Or even if you do, many people continue to live normal lives for a long time with Irumodic Syndrome. Then why do you look as if you've just signed my death sentence? I'm sorry. I guess it caught me off guard. I wouldn't worry about it. Something tells me you'll have to put up with me for a long time yet. Well, it won't be easy, but I'll manage. Captain. Has Worf found anything? No, sir. His security scans came up negative. The sensor logs give no indication that you ever left the ship. I wasn't dreaming. Something happened. Worf to Captain. Go ahead, Mr Worf. Sir, there is a transmission from Admiral Nakamura. Priority one. Beverly? Mr Worf, will you route the call through to Dr Crusher's office? Aye, sir. Captain. Admiral. I'm initiating a fleetwide yellow alert. Intelligence has picked up alarming reports from the Romulan Empire. At least 30 warbirds have been pulled from other duties and are headed for the Neutral Zone. Do we know why they would make such a blatantly aggressive move? Our operatives on Romulus say something appears to be happening in the Neutral Zone, specifically in the Devron system. Our own long-range scans picked up some kind of spatial anomaly. We can't tell what it is. What are our orders? This is a very delicate situation. I am deploying 15 starships along our side of the Neutral Zone. I want you to go there as well. See if you can find out what's going on in the Devron system. Am I authorised to enter the Neutral Zone? Not yet. Wait and see what the Romulans do. Conduct long-range scans, send probes if necessary, but do not cross the border unless they do. Understood. Starfleet out. Captain! What's wrong? This is not my time. I don't belong here. What? I was somewhere else a few moments ago. You've been right here, with me. No, no, no! I was somewhere else. I was... It was a long time ago. There was someone talking. I was talking to someone. Beverly. I was talking to Beverly! It's OK, Captain. Everything's gonna be alright. I'm not senile. This did happen! I was here. I was talking to you, and then I was somewhere else. I was... I was on the Enterprise. I was back on the Enterprise. At least, I think that's where it was. I was in sickbay. Well, it might have been a hospital. Captain, we should go back to the house and call your doctor. Yes. I know what you're thinking. ""It's the Irumodic Syndrome."" ""He's beginning to lose his mind."" Well, it's not that! And I'm not daydreaming either. Well, alright. Alright. So, what do you want to do about it? Data. I want to see Data. Data? Why? Because I think he can help. Help how? I don't know! I want to see Data. Well, OK then. Alright, let's go see Data. He's still at Cambridge, isn't he? Yes, I think he is. You see them, don't you? See who? They're everywhere. They're laughing at me. Why are they laughing? Come on, Captain. Let's go see Data. Yes. Data. We'll go see Data. I know how it sounds, but it happened. It was real. I was there, back on board the Enterprise. How do you like your tea? Tea? Earl Grey, hot. Course it's hot. What do you want in it? Nothing. Well, Data, I must say, this is a fine place you have here. They certainly treat professors very well at Cambridge. Holding the Lucasian Chair does have its perquisites. This was Sir Isaac Newton's house when he held the position. It has become the traditional residence. Here you go. Thank you. If you're really his friend, get him to take that grey out of his hair. Jessel... Looks like a bloody skunk. She can be frightfully trying, but she does make me laugh. Data, what is it with the hair anyway? I found that a touch of grey adds an air of distinction. Earl Grey? I'd swear this is Darjeeling. Captain, how long has it been since you have seen a doctor about your Irumodic Syndrome? A week. They've prescribed peridaxon. But, sir, peridaxon... Yes, I know. It's not a cure. Nothing can prevent the deterioration of the synaptic pathways. You think I'm senile, that all this is just a delusion. Now, come on, Captain. No one said anything of the kind. In all honesty, Captain, the thought has occurred to me. However, there is nothing to disprove what you are saying. So it is possible something is happening to you. The first thing we should do is run a complete set of neurographic scans. We can use the equipment in the biometric lab. Jessel, ask Professor Ripper to take over my lecture for tomorrow. Possibly for the week. Captain, we'll get to the bottom of this. That's the Data that I remember. I knew that I could count on you. Commanding Officer, Enterprise arriving. ""To Capt Jean-Luc Picard, stardate 41148..."" ""...you are hereby required to take command..."" ""...to take command of the USS Enterprise as of this date."" ""Signed, Rear Admiral Norah Satie, Starfleet Command."" Red alert! All crew to battle stations. You heard him! Move! Personal log, stardate 41153. 7. Recorded under security lockout Omega 327. I have decided not to inform this crew of my experiences. If I have travelled to the past, I cannot risk giving them foreknowledge of what's to come. Report. We've completed a full subspace scan of the ship and surrounding space. We've detected no unusual readings or anomalies. With due respect, sir, it would help if we knew what we were looking for. Noted. Counsellor, do you sense anything unusual on board? Perhaps an alien presence that doesn't belong here, maybe operating on a level of intelligence superior to our own? No, sir. I'm only aware of the crew and the families on board the ship. Mr Worf, initiate a level-two security alert, all decks, until further notice. With respect, sir, I'm the Security Chief on this ship. Unless you're planning to make a change. No, of course not. Lieutenant, security alert two. Aye, sir. Capt Picard to the bridge. On our way, Chief. Sir, Starfleet just issued an alert. A number of vessels are moving toward the Neutral Zone. What kind of vessels? Freighters, transports. All civilians. No Starfleet ships. This says that a large spatial anomaly has appeared in the Neutral Zone, in the Devron system. Captain, it could be a Romulan trick to lure us into the Neutral Zone as an excuse for a military strike. Our mission to Farpoint is cancelled and we're to go to the Neutral Zone. No, we'll proceed to Farpoint. Sir? You heard me. Captain, the security of the Federation could be at stake. Mr Worf, man your station. Aye, sir. Captain, perhaps if we understood your thinking. If you explained... I have no intention of explaining. We proceed to Farpoint as planned. Chief, are you having a problem with the warp plasma inducers? That's right. I know how to get them on line. We'll be in Main Engineering. Mr O'Brien, use these specifications to bypass the secondary plasma inducer. This isn't exactly my area of expertise. The Chief Engineer should make these modifications. But he isn't on board. Mr O'Brien, trust me. I know you can do it. All those years you spent as a child building model starship engines? They were worth it. How did you know that, sir? From your Starfleet records. Yes, sir. I'll get right to it. Fletcher, tell Munoz and Lee to get up here right away. Aye, sir. We have to realign the power grid. We'll be burning the midnight oil. That would be inadvisable. Excuse me? If you attempt to ignite petroleum on this ship at 0000 hours, you will activate the fire-suppression system. That was just an expression. Expression of what? A figure of speech. I was trying to tell him that we'd be working late. ""To burn the midnight oil"" implies late work? That's right. I am curious. What is the etymology of that idiom? How did it come to be used in contemporary language? I don't know, sir. Cmdr Data, welcome on board. It's so very good to see you. It is good to see you, too, sir. I could use your help with the infuser array. Certainly. We're having problems with the plasma conduits. This will need a completely new field-induction subprocessor. It appears we will be required to ignite the midnight petroleum, sir. Jean-Luc, what's going on? It happened again. A time shift? Yes. What happened? It's still a little vague, but I can remember more this time. It seems that every time I shift periods, I can retain more memory. At first, it appeared that I was in the future, years from now, and then I was in the past just before our first mission. What is it? I scanned his temporal lobe and compared it with a scan I performed a few minutes before. There's a 13-percent increase in the acetylcholine of the hippocampus. Within minutes, you've accumulated two days' worth of memories. You remember when I first came on board the Enterprise? Yes. What happened after the welcoming ceremony? There was a reception in ten-forward. I introduced the senior officers. Do you have any memory of my calling red alert? Do you remember us being diverted from Farpoint to the Neutral Zone? To investigate a spatial anomaly? No. There is a discontinuity between the time periods you described. Events in one time period have no effect on the other two. Yet in both past and present, there is an anomaly in the Devron system. I can't believe that's a coincidence. I may find the same thing in the future. Perhaps it's a temporal disturbance. How is this related to your time shifting? These are important questions, and perhaps I will find answers to them in the past, but now we have a threat from the Romulans. I want all departments to present a battle-readiness report by 0800 hours. Dismissed. Deanna, it's gonna be a late night. Would you like dinner first? Actually, I... We have plans. I see. I'm sorry. See you in the morning. Goodnight, sir. Worf. I want subspace sweeps. We might detect a temporal disturbance. Aye, sir. Will, this time shifting. When it happens I experience a momentary disorientation. If that should happen during a crisis, take command immediately. Number One? I'm sorry. Be prepared to take command. Aye, sir. Speaking of disorientation, are you alright? I'm just a little distracted. I'm fine. You have the bridge. I'll be in my ready room. Come. Milk, warm, a dash of nutmeg. What's this? A prescription. Warm milk and eight hours' uninterrupted sleep. Beverly... Doctor's orders. You're exhausted. I don't know if you've slept in the past or in the future, but I'm sure you haven't slept in the present. Get some rest, or I'll have you relieved and sedated. Yes, sir. What? Beverly? As a physician, it's often my job to give people unpleasant news, to tell them they need surgery, or they can't have children, or that they might be facing a difficult illness. But you said yourself, this is only a possibility. But you've been to the future. You know it's going to happen. I prefer to look on the future as something not written in stone. A lot of things can happen in 25 years. A lot of things can happen. Captain? Yes... Captain, wake up. Yes... What is it? Have we reached the Neutral Zone? The Neutral Zone? Sorry. I was in the past again. What's going on? Data's arranged to run tests on you in the biometrics lab. We're ready if you are. No. We have to get to the Neutral Zone. The Neutral Zone? Why? In the other two time periods, Starfleet reported a... A sort of a spatial anomaly in... In the Devron system. In the Devron system in the Neutral Zone! Captain... If the anomaly appeared there in the past, it might be here, too. Because you saw it in two other time frames, doesn't mean it'll be here. But if it is here, then it means something! Damn it, Geordi! I know what we have to do! Alright. OK. But first, there is no Neutral Zone. Remember? Right. Right. The Klingons in this time period have taken over the Romulan Empire. Relations between us and the Klingons aren't too cosy. I know that! I haven't completely lost my mind! Well, if we're going to the Devron system... ...we're gonna need a ship. Right now... ...I think it's time to call in some old favours. Contact Admiral Riker, Starbase 247. Jean-Luc, I'd like to help, but you're asking for the impossible. The Klingons have closed their borders to Federation starships. Will, what if this anomaly really is in the Devron system? I saw a report from Intelligence this morning on that sector. There is no activity. There is nothing unusual going on in the Devron system. I don't believe it! What if their long-range scans are faulty? We have to see for ourselves! I've got the Yorktown out near the border. I'll have her run long-range scans in the Devron system. If she finds anything, I'll tell you. That is just not good enough! It's going to have to be. I'm sorry. Riker out. Computer, restore holographic image. Damn him, anyway. After all we've been through together. He's been sitting behind that desk too long. Captain, I'm sorry. All we can do now is wait and see if the Yorktown finds anything. There is another option. We could arrange passage aboard a medical ship. Medical ship? Yes, sir. There has been Terrellian plague on Romulus. The Klingons will allow Federation medical ships to cross the border. Yes! So, what we need now is a medical ship. I think I can arrange that. Data, find the USS Pasteur. I have some pull with the Captain. At least, I used to have. This is a page from the past. I never thought I'd see either of you on a starship again. Hello, Doctor. Geordi. Doctor. Data. Let's just choose one. Alright. So, did you get my message? Yes. Jean-Luc. Crossing into Klingon territory, it's absurd. But I never could say no to you. So that's why you married me. The first order of business is to get clearance to cross the Klingon border. Agreed. What about Worf? Yes! That's it! Worf! Yes, that's the answer. Worf will help us. Data, is he still a member of the Klingon High Council? I'm not sure. Information on Klingon political structure is scarce these days. However, at last report, Worf was governor of H'atoria, a small Klingon colony near the border. Capt Picard. Yes. McKinley Station wants to know when we'll be docking. Tell them we've been called away on a priority mission. Aye, sir. So, you kept the name? Your quarters are on deck five. Get some rest. No, I'm fine. Nell, please escort the Ambassador to his quarters. You're treating me as if I am an invalid. I do have a few years left in me yet. I do not want to be led around and I do not want to be patronised. You're right. I'm sorry. Now, I'll go and get some rest. How long since his last neurological scan? I'm not sure. But I wouldn't suggest it. He says he's not taking any more damned tests. Do you really think he's moving through time? I'm not sure I do either. But he's Jean-Luc Picard, and if he wants to go on one more mission, that's what we're going to do. We'll find the anomaly. I know we will. Report. We're nearing the coordinates you gave me. Is there anything unusual in the vicinity, Mr Data? How would you define unusual, sir? Every region of space has unique properties found nowhere else. There should be a barrier of some sort nearby. A large plasma field, highly disruptive. Nothing, sir. This is the right time, the right place. He should be here now. Who, sir? Q! We're here! This has gone on long enough. Counsellor, do you sense an alien presence? No, sir. What is a Q? It's a letter of the alphabet, as far as I know. I don't understand. This is not the way it's supposed to happen. Maintain this position. I'll be in my ready room. Mon capitaine! I thought you'd never get here. Q! I knew it! What's going on? It's Judge Q to you. And isn't it obvious what's going on? The last time that I stood here was seven years ago. Seven years ago. How little you mortals understand time. Must you be so linear? You accused me of being the representative of a barbarous species. I believe my exact words were ""a dangerous, savage child-race."" We demonstrated to you that mankind had become peaceful and benevolent. You agreed and let us on our way. Why am I standing here again?! You'd like me to connect the dots for you, from A to B to C, so that your puny mind could comprehend? How boring! They'd be more entertained if you just tried to figure it out. I'll answer any ten questions that call for a ""yes"" or a ""no."" Well? Are you putting mankind on trial again? No. Is there any connection between the trial seven years ago And what's happening now? I'd have to say yes. The spatial anomaly in the Neutral Zone, is it related to what's going on? Most definitely yes! Is it part of a Romulan plot, a ploy to start a war? No and no. Five down! That's only four. ""Is it a Romulan plot? Is it a ploy to start a war?"" Those are separate questions. Did you create the anomaly? No, no, no! You'll be so surprised when you realise where it came from, if you ever figure it out. Are you responsible for my shifting through time? I'll answer that question if you promise not to tell anyone. Yes! Why? Sorry! That's not a ""yes"" or "" no"" question. You forfeit the rest of your questions. I expected as much. You're such a limited creature. A perfect example of why we made our decision. The trial never ended, Captain. We never reached a verdict. But now we have. You're guilty! Guilty of what? Of being inferior. Seven years ago, I said we'd be watching you and we have been, hoping your ape-like race would show some growth, give some indication that your minds had room for expansion. But what have we seen instead? You worrying about Cmdr Riker's career, listening to Counsellor Troi's pedantic psychobabble, indulging Data in his witless exploration of humanity. We've journeyed to countless new worlds, contacted new species, expanded our understanding of the universe. In your paltry, limited way. You have no idea how far you still have to go. But instead of using the last seven years to change and grow, you have squandered them. We are what we are, and we're doing the best we can. It is not for you to set the standards by which we are judged. But it is, and we have. Time may be eternal, but our patience is not. It's time to put an end to your trek through the stars, make room for other more worthy species. You're going to deny us travel through space? No! You obtuse piece of flotsam. You're to be denied existence. Humanity's fate has been sealed. You will be destroyed. Q, I do not believe that even you are capable of such an act. I? There you go again. Always blaming me for everything. This time, I'm not your enemy. I'm not the one that causes the annihilation of mankind. You are. Me? That's right! You're doing it right now. You did it before and you'll do it yet again. What meaningless double-talk is this? He doesn't understand! I have only myself to blame, I suppose. I believed in you. I thought you had potential. Apparently, I was wrong. May whatever god you believe in... ...have mercy on your soul. This court stands adjourned. Commander, assemble the senior staff and go to red alert. We have a bigger problem than I thought. Red alert! I don't believe him. This has to be another one of Q's games. He's probably laughing at us now, watching us jump through his hoops. Normally, I'd agree. But this time, I feel that it is different. There was a deadly earnestness about him. I think he's serious. Which means, in some fashion, I am going to be the cause of the destruction of humanity. Didn't Q say you already had caused it? And that you were causing it now? Given that there is a discontinuity between the three time periods the Captain has visited, Q's statement may be accurate, if confusing. So, what do I do? Lock myself in a room in each time period? Maybe not acting is what causes the destruction of mankind. What if you were needed on the bridge and weren't there? We can't second-guess ourselves. We should proceed normally and deal with each situation as it occurs. Agreed. I've been thinking about my conversation with Q. He admitted that he was responsible for my shifting through time. Now, it occurred to me that... ...he might be giving me a chance, somehow, to save humanity. What makes you say that? He's always had a fascination with humanity, me in particular. He has more than a passing interest in what happens to me. That is true. Q's interest in you has always been similar to that of a master and his beloved pet. That was only an analogy. Capt Picard. Go ahead. We're approaching the Neutral Zone. We're on our way. All stop. Initiate long-range scans. Captain, there are four warbirds holding position on the Romulan side of the Neutral Zone. Federation Starships Concord and Bozeman hold position on our side. A face-off. The question is, who's going to move first? We are. Mr Worf, hail the Romulan flagship. The warbird Tyrex is responding. Capt Picard. Hello, Worf. It's been a long time. It is good to see you again. Have you read our request? Yes. But you must realise I am no longer a member of the High Council. But surely you still have influence. We have to get into the Neutral Zone. Can you get us across the border? I must refuse. It is for your own safety. The Neutral Zone is extremely volatile. If Admiral Riker had given you a ship with a cloak, you'd be safe. It is hard to believe that even he would refuse to help you. I don't care what kind of ship we go in! We have to get to the Devron system. I am sorry. My first duty is to the Empire. I must adhere to regulations. I know that I am an old man and I am out of touch, but the Worf that I remember was more concerned with honour and loyalty than rules and regulations. But that was a long time ago. Maybe you're not the Worf I knew. You have always used your knowledge of Klingon honour to get what you want from me. Because it always works, Worf! Your problem is that you really do have a sense of honour and you do care about trust and loyalty. Don't blame me for knowing you so well. Very well. You may cross the border. But only if I come with you. I am familiar with the Neutral Zone. Terms accepted. Inform transporter room two to beam the Governor aboard. I must make one thing very clear. If we run into serious opposition, I'm taking us back to Federation space. We aren't well armed and wouldn't last long in a fight. Governor Worf is aboard, Captain. Alright. Set a course for the Devron system, warp 13. Once more for old times' sake? Engage. Engage to where, sir? Set a course for the Devron system and engage at warp nine. The Devron system is inside the Neutral Zone, sir. I'm aware of that. Carry on, Chief. Captain, may I have a word with you in private? Yes, of course. Contact Farpoint. I wish to speak to Cmdr Riker. Aye, sir. Captain, I just wanted to voice my concerns about the way the crew is responding to your unexpected orders. They don't trust me. They think I'm behaving erratically. Some do. Others are confused. It takes time for a crew to know their captain and for him to know them. I understand, but I know what this crew is capable of, even if they don't. It would also help if they knew what was going on. It's difficult operating in the dark, but right now I have no other choice. Yar to Capt Picard. I have Cmdr Riker for you. Excuse me. Put him through here. Cmdr Riker, we will be delayed picking you up at Farpoint. I see. May I ask how long? I can't say. I'll keep you updated. Will you inform Dr Crusher and Lt La Forge? Understood. Riker out. Is there anything else, Counsellor? Actually, sir, there is. I was debating whether to mention it and perhaps... It's about Cmdr Riker. What about him? I think you should know that he and I have had a prior relationship. I see. Do you think this will interfere with your duties? Not at all. It happened several years ago and it's well behind both of us. I thought you should know. I appreciate your telling me. But I'm sure you two will find a way to handle the situation. Thank you, sir. Tea, Earl Grey, hot. That beverage is not programmed into the replication system. So, how long shall we stare at each other across the Neutral Zone? There is an alternative, Tomalak. We each know why we're here. We could each send one ship into the Neutral Zone to investigate the anomaly in the Devron system. Has Starfleet approved this arrangement? No. I like it already. Agreed! One from each side. But if another Federation ship enters... There is no need for threats. We each know the consequences. Very well. I'll see you in the Devron system. Helm, set a course for the Devron system, warp five. Aye, sir. Engage. Sensors are picking up a large subspace anomaly directly ahead. All stop. On screen. Full scan, Mr Data. Aye, sir. We have to get as much information as possible about that anomaly. We are approaching the Devron system. Sensors are picking up a large subspace anomaly directly ahead. All stop. On screen. Then it is larger in the past. Sir? Nothing. Full scan, Mr Data. Aye, sir. On screen! On screen! Let's see it! As you can see, sir, there is nothing there. Still nothing, Captain. I have conducted a full sensor sweep out to one light year. No temporal anomalies, no particle fluctuations, nothing. It was here in the other two time periods. Why isn't it here now? I have been monitoring Klingon communications channels. Several warships have been dispatched to this sector to search for a renegade Federation vessel. You're not leaving? There's nothing here, Jean-Luc. But there has to be! Data, is there another way to scan for disturbances? Something not covered in a normal sensor sweep? There are other methods of detecting temporal disturbances but we're limited by the Pasteur's equipment. We should head back to Federation territory. However, it may be possible to modify the main deflector to emit an inverse tachyon pulse to scan beyond the subspace barrier. Make it so. Wait a minute! Data, how long would this take? To make the modifications and search the entire Devron system? 14 hours. Alright, Data, begin to modify the tachyon pulse. Ensign, lay in a course back to the Federation. We'll stay here for six hours then we're heading back, maximum warp. But six hours may not be enough. We have to stay here till we find it, no matter how long it takes. Carry out my orders. May I see you a moment? I cannot believe you're not willing... Don't ever question my orders on the bridge of my ship again! Damn it, I was just trying to... There are larger concerns. You don't understand... You would never tolerate that behaviour on the Enterprise, and I won't here. I don't care if you're my ex-captain or my ex-husband! You're right. I was out of line. It won't happen again. But you have to understand what is at stake here! Q said all of humanity will be destroyed! I know. That's why I've allowed us to stay longer and keep looking. But I also want you to allow for the possibility that none of what you're saying is real. What? Jean-Luc, I care for you too much not to tell you the truth. You have advanced Irumodic Syndrome. It's possible that all of this is in your mind. I'll stay here six hours longer and then we're heading home. I want you to remember... ...if it were anyone else but you, we wouldn't even be here. What was that she said, sonny? I couldn't quite hear her. Q? What is going on here? Where is the anomaly? Where's your mommy? Well, I don't know. Answer me! There is an answer, Jean-Luc. But I can't hand it to you. Although you do have help. What help? You're not alone, you know. What you were, and what you are to become will always be with you. My time shifting. The answer does lie there, doesn't it? Now, tell me one thing. This anomaly we're looking for, will that destroy humanity? You're forgetting, Jean-Luc. You destroy humanity. By doing what? When? How can...? Report, Mr Data. The anomaly is 200 million kilometres in diameter. It is a highly focused temporal-energy source emitting approximately the energy output of ten G-type stars. What is the source of this energy? I am uncertain, sir. Sensors cannot penetrate the anomaly. What if we modify the main deflector to emit an inverse tachyon pulse? That might scan beyond the subspace barrier. That might give us some idea of what the interior looks like. That is a most intriguing idea, sir. I do not believe a tachyon beam was ever used in such a way. I had no idea you were so versed in the intricacies of temporal theory. I have some friends who are well versed in it. Make it so. I believe we can make the necessary modifications in Main Engineering. We'd get more power routeing the primary EPS taps to the deflector. Agreed. Initiating tachyon pulse. OK. The pulse is holding steady. We're receiving data from the scan. It will take the computer time to get a complete picture of the interior. I suggest we... Geordi? What is wrong? I don't know. It's like somebody's sticking an ice pick in my temples. My visor's picking up all kinds of electromagnetic fluctuations. Data to sickbay. Medical emergency. This is amazing. The DNA in his optic nerves is regenerating. Geordi, it's as if you're growing new eyes. How is this possible? It shouldn't be possible at all. There's no medical explanation for spontaneous organ regeneration. Doctor, we've had reports from two crew members who say they have old scars which are healing themselves. Captain, I believe I have a partial explanation. I have completed my analysis of the anomaly. It appears to be a multi-phasic temporal convergence In the space-time continuum. In English, Data. It is, in essence, an eruption of anti-time. Anti-time? A relatively new concept in temporal mechanics. The relationship between anti-time and normal time is analogous to that between antimatter and normal matter. So, if time and anti-time were to collide...? They would annihilate one another causing a rupture in space. I believe this happened in the Devron system. The rupture may be sending out waves of temporal energy which are disrupting the normal flow of time. What could have caused this collision of time and anti-time? Anti-time, sir? If you modify the deflectors to send out an inverse tachyon pulse, you'll find that the anomaly is a rupture between time and anti-time. A fascinating hypothesis. How did...? I don't have time to discuss it. Do the modifications, send the pulse, then theorise as to what caused this rupture. Mr O'Brien, how large is this anomaly? Approximately 400 million kilometres in diameter, sir. I don't understand why it's bigger in the past. Lieutenant, you have the bridge. I'll be in my ready room. Aye, sir. What's going on? We're under attack. Shield strength down to 52 percent. Minor damage to the port nacelle. Two Klingon attack cruisers decloaking, port and starboard. Warp speed. Get us out of here! Warp power is off line, sir. Heading 148, mark 215. Full impulse. Impulse power fluctuating. Shields at 30 percent. Weapons status? These weapons are no match for their shields. Geordi, we need more warp power, now. I'm trying. They're too much for us. I can't keep the inducers on line. Shields at nine percent. One more hit and they'll collapse. Open a channel. Open. This is Capt Beverly Picard. We are a medical ship on a mission of mercy. Please break off all... Worf, signal our surrender. Our shields have collapsed. We are defenceless. Captain, another ship is decloaking. Bearing 215, mark 310. It is the Enterprise. They are hailing us. On screen. I knew you wouldn't listen to me. Stand by. I'll see if I can get the Klingons' attention. The Enterprise is drawing their fire. Damage report. The warp core's badly damaged. There's a breach in progress. We have to stop it! The Klingon ship is disengaging. Admiral Riker is hailing us. Sensors indicate you have a warp-core breach. Prepare to beam out. All the Pasteur's crew are on board. Where are the Klingons? Still moving off, sir. Half a light year away. They'll be back. As I said, I figured you wouldn't take no for an answer. But I thought you had more sense than to send a defenceless ship into hostile territory with no escort. If you had not refused the Captain, none of this would have happened. Unlike you, I still have a sense of honour and loyalty. We don't have time for this! The Pasteur's core is going to breach! Take us out of here. Full impulse. Alright, let's get out of here. No, Will, we can't! We have to save humanity. Engage cloak. We took a hit to a plasma coil. Our cloak isn't functioning. It'll be seven hours before we can cloak again. Do it the old-fashioned way. Head for Federation space, warp 13. Don't leave! We have to find out what's causing the temporal anomaly. We can't stay, Captain. We have to! Everything depends on it! We can't leave now! Please, listen to me! Your visual acuity's improving by the hour, Geordi. I'm sorry, Alyssa. May I take another look. You'll have a little tenderness for a few days. That's to be expected. Jean-Luc. I'll be right back, Alyssa. Alyssa lost the baby. I think it's the same phenomenon that affected Geordi. Somehow, the temporal energy from the anomaly caused the foetal tissue to revert to an earlier stage of development. It's as if the unborn child began to grow younger Until the DNA began to break down. How is she? Physically, she's fine for now. But if this temporal reversion continues, none of us will be fine. So, this is affecting the entire crew? Our cellular structures appear to be coalescing, reverting to earlier forms. In some cases, it has caused old injuries to heal, but the effect is only temporary. Eventually, it may kill all of us. We must find out how widespread the effect is. Contact Starbase 23, that's the nearest outpost. Have them check personnel for signs of temporal reversion. Mr Data, how close are you to completing the tachyon scan? One hour, 45 minutes, sir. When it's done, I want to find some way of collapsing this anomaly without making things worse. Give me a risk analysis of any solution you find. Aye, sir. Dismissed. It's a pretty big decision, Jean-Luc. Tinkering with an anomaly you know nothing about, trying to collapse it. Isn't that risky? Why? Will that cause the destruction of mankind? Maybe. On the other hand, maybe leaving it alone would be the wrong thing to do. It's a pretty big decision, alright. Would it help to have a different perspective? Welcome home. Home? Don't you recognise your old stomping grounds? This is Earth, France, three and a half billion years ago, give or take an aeon or two. Smells awful, doesn't it, all that sulphur and volcanic ash? I really must speak to the maid. Q, is there any point to all this? Look. So, the anomaly is here, too, at Earth. At this point in history, the anomaly fills your entire quadrant of the galaxy. The further back in time, the larger the anomaly. Come here. There's something I want to show you. You see this? This is you. I'm serious! Right here, life is about to form on this planet for the first time. A group of amino acids are about to combine to form the first protein... ...the building blocks... ...of what you call life. Strange, isn't it? Everything you know, your entire civilisation, it all begins right here in this little pond of goo. Appropriate, somehow, isn't it? Too bad you didn't bring a microscope. It's fascinating. Look! There they go. The amino acids are moving closer, and closer, and closer. Nothing happened. See what you've done? Are you saying that I caused the anomaly... ...and the anomaly somehow disrupted the beginnings of life on Earth? Congratulations. Concentrate on how this anomaly was initially formed. Speculation. Our tachyon pulse has been unable to completely penetrate the anomaly. We need information on the centre of the anomaly in order to speculate. Can we scan the interior? I've tried everything. There's too much interference. Nothing on board can do the job. What could? In theory, a tomographic imaging scanner with multiphasic resolution would be able to penetrate such interference. The Daystrom Institute has been working on a device, but it is still only theoretical. Data, do we have a tomographic imaging scanner? Yes, sir. Can you use it to scan the anomaly's interior? Possibly. There is a lot of interference, but I am getting some readings. This is very unusual. What is it? Our tachyon pulse is converging with two other tachyon pulses in the centre of the anomaly. The two other pulses have the exact same amplitude modulation as our own. It is as if all three originated from the Enterprise. Three pulses from three time periods... ...converging at one point in space. Captain, what are you suggesting? Computer, where is Admiral Riker? Admiral Riker is in ten-forward. The ship has held up pretty well over the years. They tried to decommission her five years ago. One of the advantages of being an Admiral is you choose your own ship. Will, how long is this thing between you and Worf going to go on? It's been going on for over 20 years. It doesn't look like it'll end soon. The last thing Troi would have wanted is for the two of you to be alienated. I agree. I think it's time to put it behind you. I tried at Deanna's funeral. He wouldn't even talk with me. It might have been tough for him. He took her death pretty hard. Yeah? Well, he wasn't the only one. I know, but I think in his mind, you were the reason he and Deanna never got together. I never did anything to stand in his way. Didn't you, Will? Did I? I didn't want to admit that it was over. I always thought we'd get together again. And then she was gone. You think you have all the time in the world, until... Yeah. Ensign, how do I get to ten-forward. It's four decks down, sir. Section 005. Thank you. My God! Will! I know why it's happening, what's causing the anomaly. We have to go back. The only place we're going back to is bed. Damn it, Will! I know why it's happening. We caused the anomaly with the tachyon pulse! It happened in three times. We did it in three different time periods. You better come with me. Will you leave me alone? Damn it, I'm not stupid! The tachyon pulses were used in the same spot in three different times. Don't you see? When the tachyon pulse... I mean... I mean, when the Pasteur used the tachyon pulse, then... We... I mean, everything started, Will. We set everything in motion. It's like the chicken and the egg. We think it started in the past, but it didn't. It started right here, in the future! That's why it's getting larger in the past. I think I know what the Captain is talking about. If I am not mistaken, he is describing a paradox. Yes, right. That's it. Intriguing. It is possible we could have caused the very anomaly we have been looking for. Let us assume that the Captain has been travelling through time. Let us also assume he initiated a tachyon pulse at the same coordinates in all three time periods. In that case, it is possible that the convergence of three tachyon pulses could have ruptured the subspace barrier And created an anti-time reaction. I see where you're going, Data. And because anti-time operates opposite the way normal time does, the effects would travel backwards through space-time. That's why it's larger in the past. It grows as it travels back in time. Alright. Say you're right. What do we do? Go back, Will, to the Devron system. He may be right. If we go back to the Devron system now, we might be able to see the initial formation of the anomaly. Riker to bridge. Set a course for the Devron system. Maximum warp. Worf, we could use a hand. Entering the Devron system, sir. Full stop. Sensors are picking up a small temporal anomaly off the port bow. On screen. I was right! It's an anti-time eruption. It was formed within the last six hours. We must stop it here, so it can't travel back through time. Mr Data, we need a solution and we need it now. It is being sustained by the tachyon pulses in the other two time periods. I suggest shutting them down. The next time I'm there I'll do it. Isn't there more we can do here? Seal the rupture? I will investigate the options. Data, disengage the tachyon pulse. Sir? Do it! The convergence of the tachyon pulses is causing the anomaly. Aye, sir. Any change in the anomaly? No, sir. Disengage the tachyon pulse. But we haven't finished the scan. I know that. But you must disengage the pulse immediately. Aye, sir. Disengaging. Why isn't the anomaly being affected? Why would it be, sir? I've shut off the other tachyon pulses But it hasn't changed the anomaly. It remains unaffected here as well. What do we do? We have to repair the rupture at the focal point where time and anti-time converge. How do we do that? If we take the ship into the anomaly, we could use the engines to create a static warp shell. Yeah, that's right. The shell would act as a barrier separating time and anti-time. Collapsing the anomaly. But it would have to be done in the other two time periods. But the anomaly is so much larger in the other time periods It may be dangerous to go in. In where, sir? Into the anomaly, Chief. Lay in a course for the centre. Transfer all power to the shields. Sir, can you give us some explanation? No, I cannot. Captain, so far we've obeyed every order, no matter how far-fetched. But if we're to risk the ship and crew, we need an explanation. I understand your concerns, Lieutenant. And if I were in your position, I'd be doing the same thing, Iooking for answers. But you won't find any, because I don't have any to give you. I know it is difficult for you to understand, but we have to take the ship into the very centre of the phenomenon and create a static warp shell. Now, this will put the ship at risk. Quite frankly, we may not survive. But you must believe I am doing this for a greater purpose. And that what is at stake is more than any of you can possibly imagine. I know you have your doubts about me, about each other, about this ship. All I can say is, although we have only been together for a short time, I know that you are the finest crew in the fleet, and I would trust each of you with my life. So, I am asking you for a leap of faith... ...and to trust me. Shields up, maximum strength. Boosting field integrity. We may encounter shearing forces in the anomaly. Preparing to initiate a static warp shell. Course laid in, sir. All decks ready, sir. Take us in, Chief. Captain, I have an idea. If we take the ship to the centre of the anomaly... ...and create a static warp shell, it could collapse the anomaly. Yes, sir. Mr Data, you are a clever man, in any time period. Helm, lay in a course and prepare to initiate a static warp shell. Aye, sir. The other two Enterprises are on their way. Very well. Ensign, take us in. We're entering the anomaly, sir. All hands, brace for impact. Temporal energy interference. Switching to... ...auxiliary power. It's hard to keep the impulse engines on line. Power fluctuations across the board. Maintain course and speed. How long until we reach the centre? At least 30 seconds, sir. We've entered the anomaly. We've reached the centre, sir. Initiate warp shell. Initiating static warp shell now. Is it working? Something is happening. A new subspace barrier is forming. Sensors are picking up two other ships. Captain, it appears to be working. The anomaly is beginning to collapse. Our warp containment is rupturing. We must eject the core. No, we must maintain the shell as long as possible. We're losing containment, Captain! I can't stop it. It's going to... Route emergency power to the antimatter containment system. There's a lot of interference. The warp shell is having an effect. The anomaly is collapsing. I can't hold it. The containment system is going. Maintain your position, Mr La...! The other ships have been destroyed. Two down, one to go. Data, report! It has nearly collapsed. Losing containment. Goodbye, Jean-Luc. I'm gonna miss you. You had such potential. But all good things must come to an end. Containment field is at critical. I'm losing it! The Continuum didn't think you had it in you, Jean-Luc, but I knew you did. Are you saying that it worked? We collapsed the anomaly? Is that all this meant to you? Just another anomaly, another day at the office! Did it work? Well, you're here, talking to me, aren't you? What about my crew? ""The anomaly. My ship. My crew."" I suppose you're worried about your fish, too. Well, if it puts your mind at ease, you've saved humanity, once again. Thank you. For what? You had a hand in helping me get out of this. I was the one that got you into it. A directive from the Continuum. The part about the helping hand, though, was my idea. I sincerely hope this is the last time that I find myself here. You just don't get it, do you, Jean-Luc? The trial never ends. We wanted to see if you could expand your mind and your horizons. And for one brief moment, you did. When I realised the paradox. Exactly. For that one fraction of a second, you were open to options you had never considered. That is the exploration that awaits you. Not mapping stars and studying nebulae, but charting the unknown possibilities of existence. What is it that you are you trying to tell me? You'll find out. In any case, I'll be watching. And if you're very lucky, I'll drop by to say hello from time to time. See you out there. Captain, are you alright? Mr Worf, what's the date? Stardate 47988. Is something wrong, sir? No. No. I think I'll get back to bed. I could use some sleep. Captain's log, supplemental. Starfleet Command reports no unusual activity along the Neutral Zone and there is no sign of a temporal anomaly. It would appear I am the only crew member to retain any knowledge of the events. Take it! Any time, Doctor. Four hands in a row. How does he do it? I cheat. I'm kidding! You know, I was thinking about what the Captain told us about the future, about how we all changed and drifted apart. Why would he want to tell us what's to come? Goes against everything about not polluting the timeline. I believe this situation is unique. Since the anomaly did not occur, there have already been changes in this timeline. The future we experience will be different from what he encountered. Maybe that's why he told us. Knowing that future allows us to change things now, so that some things never happen. Agreed. Come in. Am I too late? Of course not. Pull up a chair. Five-card draw. Deuces wild. Come in. Is there a problem, sir? No, I just thought that I might... ...I might join you this evening, if there's room. Of course. Have a seat. Would you care to deal, sir? Thank you, Mr Data. Actually, I used to be quite a card player in my youth, you know. I should have done this a long time ago. You were always welcome. So, five-card stud, nothing wild, and the sky's the limit. "
